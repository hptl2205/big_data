Last month, hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace (#GOP) broke into the Sony servers and lifted thousands of files containing sensitive information, releasing it in batches regularly since. This is just the beginning.\n\nIn their warnings and threats to Sony, #GOP made it very clear that the reason they were so angry with the entire company, of which Sony Pictures is just a brand, was because of their greed and shamelessness in greenlighting a movie that stands to disrupt international peace, by making light of terrorism. So #GOP is fighting back in the same way, they say.#GOP and \"The Interview\"Seth Rogen's most recent film is a $44 million (\u20ac35.3 million) action comedy starring good friend James Franco. Rogen also wrote the script and directed the film, which sees him and Franco playing 2 TV people whose show North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of. So he invites them over for an interview.\n\nWhile they can't think of anything but the insane ratings this will bring, their government has another idea: the CIA gets in on it and dispatches agents to speak with them and task them with killing the dictator.\n\nThey have no choice but to accept the mission, so the humor in the film is derived from the fact that they're unwilling \"secret agents,\" who are complete nincompoops to boot and who are trapped inside the world's most secure location.\n\nSpeculation has it that #GOP is a group of mercenaries acting on behalf of North Korea and Kim himself, the real one, this time, and considering how much focus there's been on the film, it's no mystery why this rumor started making the rounds.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating the hack, but the situation took a turn for the worse the other day, when #GOP sent another warning to Sony: proceed with the release of the movie and we will bomb all US theaters running it.\n\nAs a result, various theater chains have already announced they would not screen the film, others asked Sony to pay for extra security if they wanted them to honor their end of the deal, Franco and Rogen dropped out of all promotional appearances, and the big New York premiere has been canceled.\n\nSony Pictures has said nothing of the latest threat yet, but it did inform theater owners that they could decide against screening the film even though they had previous understandings and contracts.Sony has no choice but to pull \"The Interview\"Nothing is more serious than a terrorist threat. Even though the US Department of Homeland Security has been telling the media that they believe the threat has no credibility, is this risk one that anyone should want to take?\n\n\"The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places [where 'The Interview' runs] at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.),\" the hackers wrote.\n\nThis is a most serious threat, one that Sony can't possibly not take seriously. By canceling the press tour with Franco and Rogen and plans for the NYC premiere, every indication is there that they are thinking of what to do with \"The Interview\" next.\n\nThe worst part is that they don't have too much time at their disposal: the wide release date is set for December 25, and the hackers are bound to get more active as that day draws near.A few options for Sony PicturesAs we speak, the entire movie industry is watching Sony to see what they do with this movie that's already turned into a major headache for them. Not only did it get them exposed and shamed in the media like never before (because of the email exchanges the hackers made public), but it also stands to ruin them altogether.\n\nOne option would be for Sony to cancel domestic release of the film, and to have it out only in select markets, in the hope of cutting some losses. The other, more drastic one, would be to pull the comedy completely because, as one producer tells THR, this would be standard procedure if a terrorist threat was made for a concert: you cancel the concert.\n\nBoth options would mean that Sony was backing down from the hackers, and in doing so, dancing to their tune - even though they would do it to avoid the hypothetical (for now) risk of bombing.\n\nThe other option would be to continue with the release schedule, with whatever cinema chain is still standing by their side once the hackers are done with the threats. What with all the violence going on in the world right now and the huge number of deaths from terrorist attacks, this will probably mean they'll be running the film in empty theaters.\n\nTo make matters even worse, other studios will also start bleeding money because no one will see their films either, if they happened to screen in the same cinema as \"The Interview.\"A tough choice, an unprecedented situationNever before has a movie studio been under this kind of pressure over a film, and never before has this kind of threats been made against it over a stupid comedy (because \"The Interview\" is stupid, according to Sony Pictures UK exec Peter Taylor, who put it in one of the emails that got leaked).\n\nFor years, Sony Pictures has been struggling to keep up with its direct rivals, and the hack / leak has only shown the level of desperation at headquarters to narrow down the gap. This new threat has put the studio in a very tough spot, forcing it to make a decision that may very well seal its fate.",

Sony released a statement saying, \"We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\"\n\nThe FBI released a warning on Tuesday, advising theaters and other businesses associated with the movie that they could be targeted in cyberattacks.\n\nThe private document, which was obtained by Reuters, said that \"anyone associated with the production, distribution and promotion\" of the film \"could possibly become the target of cyberattacks.\"\n\nSony now appears to have abandoned \"The Interview\" completely, deciding against releasing the film in any form -- including VOD or DVD.\n\n\"Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film,\" a spokesman said Wednesday.\n\nRegal Cinemas, Cinemark, Cineplex and AMC Theatres announced earlier Wednesday that they would not show \"The Interview\" after Sony Pictures Entertainment hackers posted a message threatening movie theaters and moviegoers who attend screenings of the satire.\n\nWhile representatives from Sony did not respond to repeated calls about the status of a Thursday evening promotional screening in Chicago, a manager at the ShowPlace ICON Theatre on Roosevelt Road in Chicago confirmed the screening is no longer happening there.\n\nA hacking group, which has been releasing stolen emails from Sony executives in apparent retaliation for the comedy's assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, issued a warning Tuesday that referred to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and instructed people to stay away from theaters showing \"The Interview.\"\n\n\"We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\" the message read.\n\nSony reportedly told exhibitors Tuesday it still plans to release the film on Christmas Day but would support chains that opted not to screen it.\n\nReuters reported early Wednesday that Landmark Theatres has canceled the movie's New York premiere scheduled for Thursday night. Rogen and Franco previously canceled all media appearances Tuesday and Wednesday.",

The newspaper says that senior administration officials, who would not speak on record, says the White House is still debating whether or not to publicly accuse North Korea.\n\nOfficials told NBC News the hacking attack originated outside of North Korea, but they believe the hackers were acting on orders from the North Korean regime.\n\nNo details were given on exactly how intelligence officials made the connection. In addition, there are differences of opinion on whether the North Korea was aided by Sony insiders.\n\nUPDATE: After initially announcing it still planned to distribute the controversial film \"The Interview\" in the wake of threats by hackers, Sony Pictures Entertainment reversed itself on Wednesday and announced it will no longer release the film, which was to have opened on Christmas day, CNBC and other sources report. The move came after the country's top five major theater chains declined to show the film.\n\nThe company issued a statement which said, \"We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public. We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\"\n\nUPDATE: At least five theater chains have canceled planned showings of \"The Interview\" after the hacker group known as Guardians of Peace posted a threat online referencing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nCarmike Cinemas, which owns 278 theaters in 41 states, and Bow Tie Cinemas were first to announce plans to not show the movie. Bow Tie has 55 theaters, mostly in the Northeast.\n\nTheir decision was followed by announcements by Regal, AMC and Cinemark that they would also not be showing the movie in their theaters, according to CNBC.\n\nAccording to RE/CODE, theaters in Detroit, Baltimore and Cincinnati canceled promotional screenings on Wednesday night, and the New York premiere of the movie at the Landmark Theater on Thursday was canceled prior to the announcements.\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment has said that it still plans to distribute the movie.\n\nEARLIER STORY\n\nA new warning referencing the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has been issued by the group that is claiming responsibility for the massive Sony hack.\n\nIn the message on Pastebin, the hackers, who call themselves Guardians of Peace, said, \"We have already promised a Christmas gift to you. This is the beginning of the gift.\" It was followed by this warning:\n\nWe will clearly show it to you at the very time and places \"The Interview\" be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.\n\nSoon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.\n\nThe world will be full of fear.\n\nRemember the 11th of September 2001.\n\nWe recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.\n\n(If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\n\nWhatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nAll the world will denounce the SONY.\n\nAfter word of the warning began to spread, a reporter from the Los Angeles Times tweeted that theater owners were starting to consider pulling the movie, scheduled to be released Dec. 25.\n\nSONY HACK: We are getting word that theater owners likely might PULL #TheInterviewMovie over latest hacker threats. #SonyHack -- Joe Bel Bruno (@JoeBelBruno)\n\nDecember 16, 2014\n\nAccording to Business Week, Sony Pictures did not respond to its requests for a response to the new threat. In addition, the FBI has yet to release any comment on the threat.\n\nOn Sunday, Guardians of Peace offered not to release some email correspondence, according to FOX News.\n\nRe/Code reports the offer was made on Sunday in posts of Pastebin and Friendpaste. The hackers urged Sony employees to contact them if they do not want their correspondence released.\n\nThe message read: \"We have a plan to release emails and privacy of the Sony Pictures employees. If you do not want your privacy to be released, tell us your name and business title to take off your data.\"\n\nThe message also warned about a forthcoming disclosure, calling it a \"Christmas gift\" and gave links to several file-sharing sites for obtaining what they have released so far.\n\nRELATED: Forget the gossip, these are the lessons of the Sony hack\n\nThe first release was made on Nov. 24 and has continued since then. The releases have contained unreleased Sony movies and numerous embarrassing emails between Sony executives and Hollywood stars. The releases have also contained information about still-secret deals, movie star salaries, employee medical information, Social Security numbers of 47,000 current and former employees and other confidential information. The leaks have also contained threats against Sony employees.\n\nRELATED: The 5 most embarrassing revelations from Sony's sprawling hack\n\nIt now seems to be certain that the massive release of data is in response to Sony's comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco titled \"The Interview.\" The movie was called an \"act of war\" by North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un because it centers around a CIA plot assassinate the leader.\n\nNorth Korea has denied being involved in the but has called it a \"righteous deed.\" There has also been some speculation that the hack is actually an inside job.\n\nIn an effort to control the release of the information, Sony Pictures Entertainment hired a lawyer who sent a letter to some of the top news organizations, asking them not to report on the hack or distribute the information revealed. Few seem to have complied.\n\nIn other news, two former employees have filed a class-action lawsuit against Sony saying the studio was negligent by ignoring early warnings that its computer system was vulnerable.",

                    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Sony Pictures Entertainment, the F.B.I., theater owners and competing film studios scrambled on Tuesday to deal with a threat of terrorism against movie theaters that show Sony's \"The Interview,\" a raunchy comedy about the assassination of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\n\nThe threat was made in rambling emails sent to various news outlets Tuesday morning. A version posted by The Hollywood Reporter said, in part: \"Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\"\n\nThe email specifically aimed its threat at \"the very times and places\" at which \"The Interview\" is to be first shown. The film is set for release on Christmas Day.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Landmark's Sunshine Cinema said it had canceled the film's New York premiere scheduled for this week; its Los Angeles premiere was held Dec. 11 without incident.\n\nThat email warning turned a continuing attack on Sony by hackers from a matter of theft to one of terrorism. A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. said it \"is aware of the threat and is continuing to investigate the attack on Sony.\"\n\nLate Tuesday, a person with knowledge of Sony's dealings said that the theater chain Carmike Cinemas had canceled its showings of the movie. Carmike could not be reached for comment.\n\nA Homeland Security official said the department was analyzing the threat but as yet had found no clear indication of an active plot against theaters. Sony had no comment.\n\nTuesday's development posed an ugly dilemma for Sony and exhibitors: whether to pull \"The Interview,\" caving to hackers who have wreaked havoc with Sony's digital systems for weeks in an attempt to block the release, or to forge ahead, risking possible violence and potential legal liability. In an already-fragile industry, studio executives privately voiced concern that any theater violence could swing the market further toward home viewing.\n\nSeveral people briefed on Sony's internal discussions on Tuesday said the studio was not withdrawing the film but had told theater owners that it would not object if they canceled or avoided booking \"The Interview.\" Those people spoke on condition of anonymity. Theater owners have been particularly pressed by the operators of malls and stores within them to avoid the film, two of those people said.\n\nAn executive for one of the theater chains, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, called the invocation of the 9/11 terror attacks by hackers \"a game changer.\" The executive last week dismissed the notion that theater owners might shy away from \"The Interview\" over earlier, more general threats by North Korean officials and pressure from the hackers, who have called themselves the Guardians of Peace. Nobody yet knows the hackers' true identity.\n\nRepresentatives of AMC Entertainment, Regal Entertainment and Cinemark, North America's three largest theater chains, did not respond to queries. A spokesman for the National Association of Theater Owners, which represents exhibitors, declined to comment.\n\nPressure to pull the \"The Interview,\" which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and is directed by Mr. Rogen and Evan Goldberg, has centered on its depiction of Mr. Kim's assassination. To depict the killing of a sitting world leader, comically or otherwise, is virtually without precedent in major studio movies, film historians say. Mr. Rogen canceled planned publicity interviews on Tuesday.\n\nBut a broad threat of theater violence, following a sustained attack on Sony's digital existence, is also without precedent, and opens a new range of worry for Hollywood.\n\nAs Sony and exhibitors spoke in a 2 p.m. conference call on Tuesday, they faced the concerns of competing studios, whose important holiday films will be playing side-by-side with \"The Interview\" in multiplexes nationwide.\n\nA further complication is a general reluctance, even after the 2012 mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., theater, to visibly increase security, which might create an impression that multiplexes in general are not safe and might complicate dealings with their own insurers.\n\nIt is not unusual for studios to face threats for planned releases. In 2012, Sony was peppered with less specific threats related to \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" about the killing of Osama bin Laden. It opened largely without incident. Universal Pictures in 1988 was besieged by angry protesters when it released Martin Scorsese's \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" with its depiction of an earthy Jesus; more than a dozen people were injured when Christian opponents of the film firebombed a Paris theater showing the movie.\n\nBut those actions stopped short of what hackers appear to have promised on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, a lawsuit was filed late Monday on behalf of two former Sony Pictures employees whose personal information was stolen and published online. Lawyers for the plaintiffs noted that the hackers had \"repeatedly followed through\" on threats to disseminate the data. The complaint, filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, states that Sony ignored warnings that its computer systems were susceptible to attack.\n\nCalling the publication of personal information \"an epic nightmare\" for current and former Sony Pictures employees, the lawsuit argues that the studio \"failed to secure its computer systems, servers and databases, despite weaknesses that it has known about for years.\" Hackers claim to have taken at least 100 terabytes of Sony data, or about 10 times the amount stored in the Library of Congress, according to the complaint.\n\nAt the same time, diverging views on what to do with \"The Interview\" have emerged inside the company. The studio's powerful movie division has vigorously dug in around continued plans for a wide release, arguing that shelving the film would open the door to a cascade of threats by any determined group that dislikes a movie's content. Sony's movie executives also fear that pulling the movie would deeply injure its standing in Hollywood's creative ranks, sending top filmmakers, writers and producers to rival studios.\n\nSony Pictures executives also say they believe that \"The Interview\" has a shot at being a major box-office hit in North America, particularly given the avalanche of publicity surrounding it. The film, which cost $44 million to make, could take in $30 million in its first four days alone, according to surveys that track audience interest.\n\nThat curiosity could evaporate if people feel threatened.\n\nBut support for \"The Interview\" is not anywhere near universal within Sony, where employees have suffered from the leak of medical, salary and other personal information and have faced threats from the hackers even before Tuesday's email.\n\nOutside of the studio's movie core there are increasingly negative feelings about the movie. \"Why are we all paying the price for a movie that isn't even very good?\" one Sony home entertainment official said on Tuesday. In early reviews, \"The Interview\" has received mixed-to-negative scores.",

One group, self-styled as the \"Guardians of Peace,\" weren't fans of the idea and carried out continued hacks of Sony's computer systems.\n\nNow, though, the hackers have stepped up their threats: The group says theaters that carry the movie will be subject to physical violence. As a result, the film's New York premiere has been delayed, and Sony is offering theaters the choice of whether they wish to show the movie.\n\nSony's move to make the film optional, just nine days before its scheduled Christmas Day opening, is a first for the studio. Reportedly, Carmike Cinemas Inc., the fourth-largest theater company by number of screens in the U.S., has told Sony that it will not play the film in its theaters, and other companies may soon follow suit. In particular, theater operators that have cinemas in highly-trafficked areas, such as malls, are nervous about the group's threats.\n\nFBI says 90 percent of all cybersecurity plans wouldn't have stopped Sony Pictures breach\n\nMore data taken from Sony Pictures than first thought, including from celebrities\n\nIn its message to U.S. theater operators, the hacker group said, \"We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview' be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.

However, the agency said to The Wall Street Journal, there is \"at this time there is no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the United States.\"\n\nSony Pictures has been subject to many major headaches in the past month as a result of this group of hackers, believed to be associated with the North Korean government. In addition to the release of private information from 47,000 past and current employees, the company has also incurred a PR nightmare as private emails are released into the public sphere almost daily.",

                    "body": "It's been a tough few weeks for Sony Pictures. A group calling themselves Guardians of Peace hacked into the studio's network and stole terabytes of personal and private business documents, e-mails and more. The hack was seemingly initiated by North Korea in an effort to stop the release of Seth Rogen and James Franco's comedy The Interview, in which a talk show host and his producer try to assassinate the country's leader Kim Jong-un. They've been slowly leaking them with revelations of projects in development, some dastardly gossip garbage and more. But now they've taken things to another level with a threat of violence against any theaters who show the film, opening on Christmas Day, in the US. Read on!\n\nHere's the message containing the threat in questions:\n\nWarning\n\nWe will clearly show it to you at the very time and places \"The Interview\" be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.\n\nSoon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.\n\nThe world will be full of fear.\n\nRemember the 11th of September 2001.\n\nWe recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.\n\n(If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\n\nWhatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nAll the world will denounce the SONY.\n\nIt's clear that this hacker group is running their threats through some kind of translation application, which makes their message simultaneously sound more menacing and hilarious. But they're starting to make real impact with regards to the marketing and release of the film. Seth Rogen and James Franco had already canceled all their publicity appearances on late night talks shows and whatnot after the threat was issued yesterday, and now The New York Times reports that Sony Pictures has told theaters chains that they can decline to book The Interview if they feel legitimately worried about these threats.\n\nThe Georgia-based Carmike theater chain has already decided not to show The Interview on any of their screens when it opens on Christmas Day, and the film's New York premiere, which was set for tomorrow at Landmark's Sunshine Cinema, has since been canceled. However, it's amusing to note that despite the threat against the premiere of the film, the world premiere of the comedy already went off without a hitch on December 11th. That fact combined with Homeland Security declaring that there's no credible threat against the country from these hackers seems to call bullshit on these so-called threats.\n\nHonestly, this is a very fine line to walk, both for the movie studio and as audience members. On one hand, you don't want to let fear guide your decision to go to the movies. That's exactly what monsters like this want. Do the hackers really think they'll stop the movie from seeing the light of day? Are they going to kill anyone who comes into contact with this film? Not likely. But on the other hand, if even one theater ends up being attacked in this mess, then that's truly a tragedy, and neither the studio nor those potentially involved in some kind of incident would never live it down.\n\nAs an alternative to this issue for Sony and those who want to see the movie but not feel threatened, The Verge has made a strong case to release the film online. This way it's available to people within the safety of their homes, and Sony can, \"Take the threat of attacking theaters and diffuse it with the truth that the hackers don't seem to understand: we live in a world where every living room, every computer, and every phone is a theater. And whether it's leaked government documents or a goofy comedy from the Neighbors guy, nothing stays hidden for long.\"\n\nThey even make the case that releasing the film on iTunes or other VOD outlets could serve as a distribution experiment. The article says, \"For years studios, theaters, and VOD services have butted heads over narrowing theatrical windows and release strategies: theaters want to have movies longer, while studios want to start collecting that VOD money as soon as possible. With many theaters already dropping out, why not take the most dangerous studio movie in the world and let audiences decide what they prefer?\" That's not a bad idea at all, but it might be hard to negotiate that kind of release on short notice, and would likely just piss off the theaters who decide to still show the movie.\n\nAt the end of the day, we shouldn't let our lives be threatened by these people, especially when they are clearly full of empty threats and can only seem to cause damage from behind a computer screen. Where were these assholes when Team America: World Police came out? Is Kim Jong-un just that much bigger of a dickhead than Kim Jong-il? While I'll have stuff to do with my family on Christmas Day, you can bet your ass that I'll be heading to theaters to see The Interview, and I hope that the rest of the country decides to go out of their way to see it (unless raunchy comedy just isn't their thing). Anyway, if any other theater chains decide to pull The Interview from their screens, we'll be sure to let you know. Thoughts?",

Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.) Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY.\"\n\nIn response, Sony has canceled the New York premiere of the film, told theater owners that they have no obligation to show the movie, and halted scheduled press events for the movie's stars, Seth Rogen and James Franco. Carmike Cinemas, the nation's fourth largest movie theater chain, has already said that it will not show the movie, which is scheduled for a Christmas day release. There's some concern that theaters that show the movie could be legally liable in the event of an attack now that a threat has been made.\n\nAn official with the Department of Homeland Security told The New York Times that there were no signs that a plot against movie theaters was in the works, but that the agency is investigating the threat.\n\nThe hacking group, which some reports have suggested may be linked to the North Korean government, has already released a slew of internal emails and other communications harvested from their attack on Sony, which shut down the company's computer operations for days last month. Finished but unreleased feature-length films, including Annie, have been posted to online file-sharing networks in the wake of the attacks. Estimates indicate that cost of repairing computers systems, investigating the attack, and upgrading the company's electronic security measures could cost upwards of $70 million. Additional legal costs and other damages could put the hack's price tag well over $100 million.\n\nThe hackers have targeted the release of The Interview from the beginning, but most of the leaked documents don't have anything to do with the movie. However, one set of emails between Sony chief Amy Pascal and Rogen, who co-wrote and co-directed the film, shows intense discussions over the graphic particulars of how the film depicts Kim Jong Un's gory death. The emails, reported by Gawker, also show internal studio concern about the movie's original release date, October 10, which coincided with a North Korean state holiday.\n\nThe big question now is whether Sony might pull the movie entirely. That doesn't seem likely, as experts tell MarketWatch, but Sony isn't commenting one way or another at this point. If Sony does go ahead and yank the movie from release entirely, it would add considerably to the cost of the hack -- and it would set a dangerous precedent, proving that a major U.S. movie studio, or any other media company, could be blackmailed into submission for even planning to criticize a foreign dictator.",

Hackers also released emails sent and received by Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton, the latest in a series of email disclosures aimed at embarrassing top studio executives.\n\nLandmark Theatres said Thursday's New York premiere of \"The Interview\" at Sunshine Cinema had been canceled.\n\nThe hackers, calling themselves Guardians of Peace, say they are punishing Sony for making a film that depicts the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Their tactics took a darker turn Tuesday, as they urged moviegoers to steer clear of \"The Interview,\" which is scheduled to hit theaters Dec. 25.\n\n\"The world will be full of fear,\" the group said in a statement that referenced the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. \"Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY.\"\n\nFederal law enforcement officials have \"no credible intelligence\" of a plot to attack movie theaters, according to a Department of Homeland Security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal assessments. The official said local law enforcement authorities are being briefed on developments, and Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck told reporters that his department takes the \"threats very seriously and we will take extra precautions during the holidays at theaters.\"\n\nLate Tuesday, Carmike Cinemas, the fourth-largest theater chain, with 2,917 screens in 41 states, became the first major exhibitor to scrap plans to screen \"The Interview,\" said a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the decision.\n\nThe decision followed an emergency meeting of the National Assn. of Theatre Owners, where Sony executives told theater owners that they would be free to drop \"The Interview\" from their holiday schedules without breaching their contractual agreements or jeopardizing future bookings of Sony films, according to people familiar with the meeting.\n\nCarmike and representatives of the other major chains, Regal, AMC and Cinemark, declined to comment.\n\nEven if the hackers are bluffing about a terror attack on moviegoers, they have shown that they can cripple Sony -- and might potentially do the same to the theater chains, said Peter Toren, a cybersecurity expert who has worked in the Department of Justice.\n\n\"Given the sophisticated nature of this attack, it's not impossible to believe they would have the capabilities to disrupt the showing of 'The Interview,'\" he said. \"They can interfere, for example, with the way movie tickets are sold online. That would be the next logical place they could go and cause a lot of disruption, and that would cost the theaters a lot of money.\"\n\nPhil Zacheretti, president and chief executive of Phoenix Big Cinemas Management in Knoxville, Tenn., said he was mulling over whether to show the movie.\n\n\"At this moment we have it booked for all of our theaters,\" Zacheretti said, but added: \"Things could change in a moment's notice. It's a very serious issue. Our perspective is we usually show movies and the public can decide what they want to see. But we don't want to put anyone at risk.\"\n\nOther theater owners said they were not intimidated by the threat.\n\n\"We have an absolute right to play it,\" said Tom Stephenson, a partner in Dallas-based Look Cinemas. \"We'll take every appropriate precaution.\"\n\nAlong with fewer theaters releasing the film, Sony is apparently scaling down its marketing campaign. Last Thursday's premiere in Los Angeles was an unusually quiet affair, and on Tuesday the movie's stars, Seth Rogen and James Franco, canceled upcoming media appearances.\n\nAs the crisis widened, politicians who have until now been largely quiet on the Sony attack began speaking out.\n\n\"Today's threat against moviegoers is unconscionable and the perpetrators must be brought to justice,\" U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a statement. \"Law enforcement is investigating these threats and will do everything possible to keep the public safe.\"\n\nSony declined to comment on the threat.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting at the studio Monday, Lynton vowed that the hackers would not \"take us down. You should not be worried about the future of this studio.\" That did not seem to damp a growing sense of dread among the more than 6,000 employees at the Culver City studio, according to company insiders, especially as more confidential documents were released.\n\nHackers on Tuesday released about 32,000 of Lynton's emails that date from November 2008 to November 2014.\n\nThe emails offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse at how Lynton and other executives responded to the burgeoning crisis over \"The Interview.\"\n\nIn September, Rogen emailed Lynton thanking him for \"helping us resolve this issue with the movie.... I'm so happy that it looks like it's finally behind us.\" It wasn't clear what Rogen was referring to by \"this issue.\"\n\nOther emails reflect the unease of several executives over the film.\n\nNicole Seligman, president of Sony Corp. of America, emailed Lynton on Oct. 8 with a link to a Business Insider article with the subject line \"Possible Coup In North Korea.\"\n\nRed flags over North Korea were raised far earlier. Keith Weaver, Sony's executive vice president of worldwide government affairs, emailed Lynton, Sony Pictures co-Chairman Amy Pascal and other executives July 9 to notify them that North Korea had brought its concerns about \"The Interview\" to the U.N. General Assembly Security Council.\n\nShiro Kambe, a spokesman for Sony Corp., also notified Seligman and former Sony public relations chief Charles Sipkins of his concerns.\n\n\"We understand that several US media recently reported about North Korea's decision to put two detained American tourists on trial,\" Kambe wrote July 2.\n\nCompounding matters for Sony, the studio was hit with two lawsuits over the massive computer breach that exposed the personal information, including medical records, of thousands of current and former employees.\n\nLawyers representing two former Sony Pictures employees on Monday night filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles. It seeks class-action status.",

                    "body": "The dominoes fell swiftly Tuesday. The group behind the massive Sony hacks released another cache of confidential information, threatening violence against movie theaters that dare play the Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy The Interview. Soon both actors canceled the rest of their promotional appearances for the film, and Sony told theater chains that it \"wouldn't object\" if they chose to drop the film due to safety concerns. Carmike Cinemas was the first company to take Sony up on its offer, with Landmark Theatres calling off the movie's New York premiere hours later.\n\nAs an event, it's unprecedented: a cyberattack has rocked a major corporation in the most public of ways, and is now dictating the release of a major motion picture in the United States. And yet the studio still has one card tucked in its back pocket.\n\nSony should release The Interview online. Right now.\n\nThreats of violence can't be taken lightly by theater owners\n\nAlmost from the beginning the hacks have been about stopping people from seeing the movie. It's such a bizarre tactic that if the stakes were lower you'd almost think it was an elaborate PR stunt -- the kind of thing that would fit right in with a story about a TV personality recruited to kill the leader of North Korea. But threats of physical violence can't be taken lightly, not by theater owners worried about legal liabilities nor by Sony Pictures itself. This is a post-9/11, post-Aurora America, and frankly a movie premiere being attacked doesn't sound all that implausible. So while it's tempting to flip a jingoistic middle finger and chant \"We won't let the terrorists win!\" the realities of huge corporations looking out for their own best interests is another matter.\n\nDoes it smack of censorship and impinging of free speech? Absolutely -- though what it feels like most is the conservative choice. Hollywood loves a safe bet, and Sony making the passive move to let theaters opt out at their leisure is as safe as it gets, no matter what creative voices get stifled. Of course, the film industry has always been more about business than it has been about creative expression anyway, and in that sense The Interview can simply be framed as fallout from a bad business decision: Sony Pictures decided to make a movie about killing a real-world dictator, and is suffering immeasurably as a result.\n\nEvery living room, computer, and phone can be a movie theater\n\nBut it's foolish for anybody -- even the hackers themselves -- to think that The Interview will simply disappear, or that a movie's life begins and ends at your local multiplex. Things leak. They spread. A version of Kim Jong-un's death scene is already out in the wild. So what Sony should really do is take the game online. Throw the movie up on iTunes and Amazon. Get crazy and give Crackle a shot. Take the threat of attacking theaters and diffuse it with the truth that the hackers don't seem to understand: we live in a world where every living room, every computer, and every phone is a theater. And whether it's leaked government documents or a goofy comedy from the Neighbors guy, nothing stays hidden for long.\n\nWould it open Sony up to having additional additional emails leaked? Would it open up content providers to potentially adding their names to the hackers' hitlist? Potentially, and we certainly don't know what other personal threats have been made directly to the heads of Sony Pictures. But anyone expecting the leaks to stop at this point hasn't been paying attention, and as long as the movie is kept under wraps there's that dangling, implied threat: don't show it or else. Releasing the movie online would allow the company to take a principled stand against its attackers and shatter that tension.\n\nReleasing it for free would bring a bonanza of good will\n\nReleasing it for free would bring a bonanza of good will at a time when the studio needs it, but charging could be an even stronger choice, serving as a bold experiment in day-and-date video-on-demand releases. For years studios, theaters, and VOD services have butted heads over narrowing theatrical windows and release strategies: theaters want to have movies longer, while studios want to start collecting that VOD money as soon as possible. With many theaters already dropping out, why not take the most dangerous studio movie in the world and let audiences decide what they prefer? Make it a premium rental, even; I'd certainly pony up to see The Interview from the comfort of my home, even if it just turns out to be the goofy bro-com it appears to be.\n\nThis is a scenario unlike anything we've ever seen before, and Sony Pictures is at a unique point in history. As theater chain stocks dipped Tuesday, the hacks began to look more like true economic terrorism -- impacting an entire industry, not just a lone company. TV shows and movies will undoubtedly stay away from portraying North Korea in a negative light moving forward, the chilling effect that this kind of strong-arming leads to. And what happens between now and Christmas Day, when the film is (still) scheduled for release, will establish a precedent that sets the tone for years to come.\n\nThe hackers, whomever they may be, have used the internet to attack Sony Pictures. They've used it to intimidate Sony Pictures. Now Sony can use that same internet to fight back and spread The Interview across the world.",

The group threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nOn Nov. 24, the same group launched a massive cyberattack against Sony Pictures, accessing confidential emails, salary documents, personal information on the studio's employees and screeners of unreleased films. It then globally disseminated the data, including some candid critical comments studio chiefs had made about various stars and other Hollywood figures.\n\nCarmike Cinemas, which operates theaters in the South, announced Tuesday it wouldn't be showing \"The Interview.\" It was followed Wednesday by AMC, Cinemark and Regal - which collectively control most of the theaters in Orange County.\n\nSony said it was canceling the release of \"The Interview\" \"in light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.\" The movie was to begin screening at 7 p.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,\" Sony said in a press release. \"We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\"\n\nA studio spokesman added Wednesday that Sony won't release \"The Interview\" in any form, including video on demand or DVD, the movie industry trade publication Variety reported.\n\nWith a budget of about $40 million, \"The Interview\" was predicted to earn around $30 million in its opening weekend. Sony also stands to lose tens of millions in marketing costs already incurred.\n\nThe online threats weren't specific enough to deter Bob Stewart of Huntington Beach from wanting to see \"The Interview.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" Stewart said. \"I would be more afraid if they said, 'We're going to bomb the theater or commit an act of violence of that nature.' Then I would be more concerned, and then I might think twice about it. (But) just a threat like, 'We're going to do harm'? It's very vague.\"\n\nOnline commenters, many anonymous, decried Sony's move as cowardly.\n\n\"Boycott Sony and the big movie chains like AMC who caved to terrorist threats,\" said a commenter going by the name Parker.\n\n\"They are capitulating to North Korea's demands. This is a very sad day for the U.S., artistic freedom, and the world,\" said another, who identified himself as Stanley. \"If America can't make a movie mocking a dictator, then the free world is over.\"\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a veteran box office tracker and senior media analyst for Rentrak, which forecasts the box office performance of upcoming movies, couldn't guess what Sony might do next or what the decision might mean for other controversial releases.\n\n\"It's tough to speculate about any of it. This is just a unique set of circumstances.\"\n\nNatalie Turpin of Los Angeles said the online threats were concerning and that she would have avoided the movie on Christmas Day if it hadn't been pulled. \"They were making threats that it was going to be a 9/11-style thing at the theater.\"\n\nShe added: \"Obviously ... we offended their country. If somebody made a movie about offing Obama, we would have issues with that.\"\n\n\"Then you're letting terrorism win,\" her companion, Jon Sheppard of Costa Mesa, joked. \"I think I would (want to) go more, just to (tick) them off even more. ...\n\n\"I knew there was going to be problems.\"\n\nContact the writer: aboessenkool@ocregister.com",

North Korea has publicly denied it was involved.\n\nIn canceling he Christmas day release, Sony released a statement saying, \"In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film The Interview, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release. We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers.\"\n\nLater, a Sony spokesman said the company had no further release plans for the film, Variety reported.\n\nAs of Wednesday AMC Entertainment, Regal Cinemas, Cineplex and Cinemark had opted to drop the movie after the hackers issued threats that implied the theaters showing the movie were terror targets. According to TMZ, Bow Tie Cinemas also canceled planned showings of the movie.\n\nIn its statement, Sony also said the company was \"the victim of an unprecedented criminal assault against our employees, our customers, and our business.

This includes continued, regular information sharing with our state, local, federal and international partners, builds on ongoing work such as enhanced protection at federal facilities,\" the official said, adding that the public is encouraged to report any suspicious activity to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n\nA representative for the FBI Los Angeles Field Office told FOX411 that the bureau is \"aware of the recent threats and continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate.\"\n\nSecurity experts told Fox that in the wake of the Sydney siege and the release of the CIA enhanced interrogation report last week, it is crucial that the threat be taken seriously by authorities.\n\n\"This threatening statement obviously has some foundation and may be linked to current global hostilities towards the west and predominantly the U.S.,\" said Lee Oughton, global security and risk management expert. \"We are still unaware how deep the hackers were able to penetrate into the Sony systems.

                    "body": "Are Sony and America's multiplex chains doing the right thing by canceling the release of \"The Interview\" after threats of 9/11-style violence? Or has a truly unfortunate precedent just been set?\n\nOn Wednesday, Sony Pictures dropped plans for a Christmas Day release of the film, following a threat by hackers and the decision of the country's biggest movie theater chains to call off screenings. A spokesman later said that \"Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.\" In the comedy, James Franco and Seth Rogen star as two U.S. journalists sent to assassinate North Korean president Kim Jong-un.\n\nContinue reading below\n\n\"We respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers,\" Sony said in a statement. \"We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\"\n\nOn Wednesday evening, news reports emerged that federal investigators have connected the North Korean government to the recent hacking of Sony Pictures' computers.\n\nWe may now never know, but it's likely that \"The Interview\" is not a class-A addition to the ranks of world cinema. The film may be as stupidly amusing as Franco and Rogen's previous collaborations, \"Pineapple Express\" (2008) and \"This Is the End\" (2013). It may very well be worse. (An early review in Variety calls it \"as funny as a communist food shortage.\") No matter.\n\nBy caving in to the threats of a hacker group called Guardians of Peace, reportedly working at the behest of North Korea's government, Sony and the major exhibition chains have opened the door for any zealot or teenage hacker with mad skills to make all the threats and mayhem they want. This will not be the last such event.\n\nBut wait, wasn't the safety of theatergoers the most important issue once the hackers escalated their tactics to threats of physical violence? Read the most recent missive from Guardians of Peace: \"The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\"\n\nWhen a bomb threat is phoned into a school, don't they cancel classes? True enough, and the nation's major exhibition chains -- Regal, AMC, Carmike, Cinemark, and Cineplex -- may have felt as though they had no other choice, given that the film's distributor, Sony, initially left the matter up to them.\n\nBut there's a freedom of expression aspect to this situation, in that the hacker group has now successfully shut down moviegoers' ability to choose whether or not to see the film for themselves. Rogen, Franco, and Sony have the right to make as lame and inadvisable a movie as they want; it should still be allowed to be seen. The standard litmus test of unacceptable speech is the clich\u00e9 of shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded movie theater. \"The Interview\" isn't doing that. The hackers are -- almost literally.\n\nHollywood was already rattled before the threats. Since Nov. 24, seven data dumps of Sony documents have been released to the public, detailing personal employee information (Social Security numbers, salaries) as well as the often fractious inner workings of studio executives' communications and decision making. Several of Sony's in-the-pipeline films, including the new \"Annie,\" were also made public, and copies quickly multiplied on file-sharing sites. An eighth \"Christmas present\" has been promised along with the aforementioned threats to theaters.\n\nThe press has had a field day with these documents, and the discussions of whether to publish them has been loud, impassioned, and actually quite useful. These are the growing pains of the media moonscape in which we now live. On the other hand, much of the reporting on catty e-mails from and to Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal has been schadenfreude masquerading as journalism. Executives in the film industry trash-talk one another and the talent and make stupid racial jokes -- this is news? Somewhere in the Hollywood afterlife, Louis B. Mayer, Harry Cohn, and all four of the Warner brothers are rolling their eyes at our collective naivete.\n\nOther conversations spiraling off the hack: Who green-lighted \"The Interview\" in the first place? What studio suit thought it was a smart idea to make a film about killing the leader of the most hostile, paranoid country on the planet, one that happens to have nuclear capability? The existence of this movie says much about the entitled \"audacity\" of comic creators slapping one another on the back as they seek new taboos to break. (And I say that as a fan of Rogen and -- every so often -- Franco.)\n\nSome of the public discussion has broken down on expected partisan lines. Those on the left have said, well, we might feel equally chuffed if the North Koreans had made a movie about assassinating Barack Obama. Those on the right respond, Where were you when \"Death of a President\" came out in 2006? That independent British film, which envisioned the assassination of then-President George W. Bush, caused a furor, primarily among those who didn't see it. The title event happens mostly offscreen early on and is used as a pretext to imagine an ensuing government crackdown. It's not a very good film, but it's earnestly intended and less exploitive than its unfortunate title. And, unlike \"The Interview,\" it doesn't feature a comic scene of Kim Jong-un's head exploding in flaming chunks of hair and skin.\n\nAll right, maybe the world won't miss this movie. but that's not the point. (More likely, anyone who really wants to see it eventually will, since you can bet that pirated copies will turn up in the usual dark alleys of the Web.) With the announcement that \"The Interview\" would not be released in any form at any date -- not even in secondary markets like streaming video or on DVD -- Sony and the entertainment industry have capitulated completely to an invisible enemy with no proven ability to strike violently in America.\n\nBut who wants to call that bluff? Not entertainment corporations with customers to protect -- and images, profits, and international distribution agreements. (Not to mention a parent company in Japan, a country that has a long history of tensions with North Korea.) In the grand Hollywood tradition, a studio has censored itself before someone else could do it for them. In the process, it has opened the door to anyone who wants to watch a big corporation wriggle on a hook and -- unlike most of us -- has the skill set to make it happen. And it has lost the first battle in what may yet become a whole new kind of war.\n\nTy Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @tyburr.",

We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,\" the company said on the nbcnews.com website.\n\nEven with bomb threats swirling around the film, Island residents and those who work here had mixed feelings about whether or not they would go see the film under threats of a \"9/11-like\" attack.\n\n\"There's always controversy when it comes to politics. Personally, I don't believe the threat and it's a little extreme -- why would they do that? What's the point?\" asked Britney Heimerle, 24, of Great Kills, who acknowledged she was on the fence about seeing the film.\n\n[\"If there's a real threat] \"to kill lots of people -- maybe even people who are not going to see the film -- just to make a point, maybe it's better that they not put the movie out, if there's a risk to society,\" Ms. Heimerle said.\n\nJacob Horenburg of Great Kills, who works at Preferred Auto Parts, said actor/comedians Seth Rogen and James Franco are very good, he finds the storyline of the new movie intriguing, and he would definitely go see the movie regardless of any bomb threats.\n\n\"A threat could come from anywhere,\" said Horenburg, \"You could walk across the street and have a car hit you.\" He also noted that the Department of Homeland Security has not substantiated any threats.\n\nThe bomb threats are the just the latest attack by a group which has said its mission is to bring down Sony Entertainment. Dubbing itself the Guardians of Peace -- GOP -- it began hacking Sony officials' emails about four weeks ago.\n\nBut Tuesday the hacks escalated and a threat was added: Moviegoers seeing the film will suffer violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe crux of the new film, featuring Rogen and Franco, is the depiction of a fictional assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. That is believed to be the reason for the hacking and threats, according to US Magazine.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said there is \"no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,\" but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security.\n\nBefore it decided to cancel the opening, Sony told theater owners they could pull \"The Interview\" if they wished -- leaving the decision in their hands, according to Variety.\n\nGregg Scarola, managing director of the independent film theater, Atrium Stadium Cinemas in Eltingville, said earlier on Wednesday that the threat issue had taken him \"by surprise. I don't consider it credible, but I would like to get a better feeling of the film from the studio before we make a decision.\"\n\nScarola thinks the film is important, and good pedigree of those involved in it, including Rogen and Franco, means the product will be good and bring in good business. Their previous film, \"This is the End,\" did very well, he said.\n\n\" 'The Interview' is a comedy and it should be taken as such, but obviously there are some extremists who don't view it as that. I tend to agree with the Department of Homeland Security that it doesn't pose a credible threat, but I would like to see how it plays out,\" Scarola said.\n\nRegal Entertainment, which owns United Artists Theaters and has locations in New Dorp and Mariners Harbor, had decided to delay the opening of the film before Sony made its announcement.\n\nAlexa Venito of Manalapan, N.J., who also works at Preferred Auto Parts, said she would go see the film. \"I'm a fan of James Franco,\" said the 18-year-old redhead, adding that the storyline was interesting. As for threats to theatergoers, \"I don't believe it,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not worth my life; it's not making me any money,\" said Steven Venito, 22, her brother and also a store employee. \"I'll see it when it comes out on DVD.\"\n\n\"Why would I go see it if they are threatening people's safety? I wouldn't,\" said Richard Modica of Rossville, who was having lunch with his daughter, Nina, 11, at Ho-Wok restaurant in the neighborhood.\n\n\"I don't want to get killed or see people get hurt,\" said Nina.\n\n\"These days there are no guarantees, it's just not safe anymore,\" Modica said.\n\nMs. Heimerle acknowledged that not showing the film would be considered giving into the terrorists, but \"at the end of the day, which is better -- losing people or giving in and everyone gets to go home?\"",

(If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.) Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY.\"\n\nThe message also contained links to the email archive of Michael Lynton, the Sony Pictures chief executive, in what is apparently the ninth dump of hacked company.\n\nThe latest release seemed to be a direct response to Mr Lynton, who told a meeting of Sony employees on Monday: \"This won't take us down.\"\n\nIn their message, the Guardians of Peace wrote of the new email trove: \"We have already promised a Christmas gift to you. This is the beginning of the gift.\"\n\nRogen and Franco have cancelled all forthcoming media appearances promoting the film because of security concerns following the latest threats.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times earlier reported that anxiety among Sony employees had heightened after some received an email from someone claiming to be part of the hacking operation.\n\nIt asked them to sign a statement disassociating them from Sony. \"If you don't, not only you but your family will be in danger,\" the message threatened.\n\nNorth Korea has denounced The Interview as an \"act of war\" and praised the hacking as a \"righteous deed\", while denying involvement in the cyber attack. The hackers had previously only referred to the film as \"the movie of terror\".",

That cancellation comes as the film's co-stars, Seth Rogen and James Franco, already backed out of several media events around the films.\n\nThe threat, which may or may not have come from the same people who hacked Sony Pictures, intimated at the possibility of attacks on theaters that choose to show the movie, a completely fictional comedy about journalists recruited by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. \"We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time,\" read the message, with \"the places\" apparently referring to theaters showing the film. The message also invoked the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nWhile Sony is at this point going ahead with the film's Christmas Day release, sources told NBC News that the company won't punish theaters that back out. The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, has said there's no \"credible intelligence\" regarding an attack on movie theaters in the U.S.\n\nThe threat also coincided with a new release of Sony employees' emails, several weeks after hackers breached Sony Pictures' systems and posted troves of company and employee confidential data online. Early reports linked the hacks to North Korea, which is reportedly furious over The Interview's plot about killing the North Korean leader. However, North Korea denied conducting the attack, and the little evidence thus far tying the country to the incident is circumstantial.\n\nThe total fallout of the Sony attack is still incalculable, but it could amount to the most damaging corporate cyberattack in history.",

Carmike had already announced on Tuesday it would pull The Interview.\n\nThe dramatic decisions come just a day after those behind an ongoing hack on Sony Pictures warned mass violence may await those who see The Interview on opening day.\n\n\"The world will be full of fear,\" the statement read. \"Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.) Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment.\"\n\nThe threat received considerable attention, prompting a Department of Homeland Security official to say there is \"no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the United States.\"\n\nIt remains unclear who is behind the Sony hack. Many suspect North Korea's government to be the culprit, though the hermetic nation has officially denied those allegations -- but it has called the cyberattack a \"righteous deed.\" The FBI is currently investigating the intrusion, which became public on Nov. 24.\n\nDelaying the release of a movie due to controversy is exceedingly rare, but not without precedent. The 2013 action movie Gangster Squad was bumped four months following the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises, which left 12 dead and wounded 70 others. Gangster Squad, which depicted a unit in the Los Angeles Police Department that hunted mobsters in the 1940s and '50s, included a scene portraying a shooting at a movie theater.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, several films were delayed, including action-comedy Bad Company, which featured a criminal plotting to detonate a bomb in Grand Central Station, and Big Trouble, which involved a nuclear bomb aboard an aircraft. Both movies eventually saw a wide release.\n\nSony, which is distributing the The Interview, told theaters earlier this week that it planned to go ahead with the Dec. 25 release but that it would respect any decision to pull the film.\n\nThe hackers, who refer to themselves as the \"Guardians of the Peace,\" included their threat alongside a release of a new batch of documents stolen from Sony Pictures.",

The decisions as continuing fallout from the Nov. 24 hacking of Sony Pictures by a group calling itself Guardians of Peace and threats by the cyberterrorists to bomb any theater that showed the film.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press and other news organizations that federal investigators have connected the hacking directly to North Korea and are expected to make an announcement Thursday to that effect. North Korea has always denied involvement with the hacking.\n\nIt's the first time in history that cyberterrorists have brought a multi-billion-dollar movie studio to its knees. The hackers escalated their campaign against the pending release of \"The Interview\" in recent days and on Tuesday, threatened to attack any theater that showed the film. That led to the cancellation of the film's New York premiere, and subsequent decisions Wednesday by the theater chains and Sony.\n\nWhile movies are sometimes pulled after low initial turnout or bad reviews, none has been pulled for national security reasons, said Chronicle movie critic Mick LaSalle.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Sony explained its decision:\n\n\"Those who attacked us stole our intellectual property, private e-mail, and sensitive and proprietary material, and sought to destroy our spirit and our morale - all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public. We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\"\n\nSony is considering sending the film straight to video.\n\nSeveral movie pundits and theater owners contacted by The Chronicle were wary of speaking publicly, citing a dangerous new era for entertainment in which you never know who is watching. Several mentioned this year's film \"Rosewater,\" about a journalist who was brutally tortured in an Iranian prison after an interview he conducted on \"The Daily Show\" in 2009.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said there was \"no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,\" but noted it was still analyzing messages from the Guardians of Peace.\n\n\"It's a really difficult thing,\" said Gary Meyer, co-founder of Landmark Theatres and former manager of the Balboa Theatre in San Francisco. \"I don't believe in censorship and would not want to cancel the film, but that puts a lot of people, including the staff, into a difficult situation.\n\n\"It's a long, long, long shot that something could happen, but there are crazies out there. Someone not related to the hackers could decide they are going to go in and get some glory out of this.\"\n\nIf Sony were smart, Meyer said, they would make plans to distribute the movie on demand, for a high price, and not announce it until 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe plot of the \"The Interview\" follows a vain, slightly brainless celebrity interviewer (James Franco) whose show is a big favorite of Kim's. The show's producer (Rogen) and his star are granted an interview with Kim, so they head to Pyongyang -- but not before they are visited by the CIA and asked to kill the dictator.\n\nWhen the North Korean regime learned of the plot over the summer, the government wrote to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calling the film an \"undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war,\" and promised \"decisive and merciless countermeasure\" if the film was completed.\n\nMeanwhile Tweets to #TheInterviewMovie exploded, with a reaction divided between those who agreed with the caution, and those who wanted to boycott Sony for cowardice. Many said this signaled the death knell for public movie houses, and expected Sony to offer the movie via download instead.\n\n\"We are considering making a call to Sony ourselves to see if we can show it,\" said Rick Norris, publicity director of the Roxie Theater in San Francisco, \"so people have some place to go to see the movie. It would do business, and I hear it's not bad.\"\n\nWhen Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writer-directors of the film (Rogen is also the star) stopped by the Castro Theatre for a preview screening of the film in November, the hacking scandal was just getting started.\n\n\"I don't feel any guilt in villainizing (Kim),\" said Rogen at the time, adding that he did not feel he was in any personal danger.\n\nBut since the 9/11-style threats, Rogen and Goldberg have been canceling interviews and appearances connected with promoting the film. On Wednesday, James Franco canceled his planned Sunday visit to The Roxie, for an event celebrating Coppola family films.",

So far, only Carmike has publicly commented on the decision, but official word from each company is expected shortly.\n\nFollowing today's release of a message sent from the mysterious group responsible for the massive Sony hack, the company has now informed theater owners that they can opt out of screening 'The Interview' if they are concerned about the terrorist threat. Although the Department of Homeland Security responded by saying they could find \"no credible info\" on planned attacks, Sony has decided to place the decision to screen the film in the hands of theater executives.\n\nEarlier today, a message from the group known as Guardians of Peace was translated, revealing that the people responsible for the Sony hacking are threatening a terrorist attack comparable to 9/11. Here's part of that message:\n\nWe will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview' be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.\n\nNeither Sony nor the National Association of Theater Owners have released a formal statement, but according to THR, Sony has informed theater owners that they may cancel screenings of 'The Interview' if they are concerned about the threat. Sony will support the theaters regardless of the decision they choose, which some feel is irresponsible, given that this is Sony's film and they should ultimately be making the decision.\n\nTheater owners have also reportedly requested increased security if they choose to screen the film, which hits theaters on Christmas Day. In an interview with ABC, Richard Clarke, a cyber security expert and former counter-terrorism advisor to the White House tried to soothe fears following the group's threatening message:\n\nSomebody is playing mind games with [Sony]. I think North Korea has little or no capability to do any physical attacks, commando activity, or terrorism in the U.S. By saying it's coming, however, they hope to keep people from the theaters and, thereby, hurt Sony's revenue.\n\nAn anonymous theater executive spoke with Deadline about the precautions they are taking at their theater, which still intends to screen the film:\n\nOur first call was to the chief of police to get his assessment of the terrorist threat level. He concurred with what is being reported in the media; the threat of terrorist action is extremely low. That said, the police department will be doing a security briefing with our managers and staff so that everyone is on the lookout for any suspicious behavior.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how many theater owners and chains will opt out of showing 'The Interview,' but Sony doesn't appear to be the only studio worried about the threat: a rival studio executive told THR that they feel \"this is bad for everyone.\"\n\n'The Interview' may or may not be released by your local theater on December 25.",

The move comes after several major theater chains decided not to run the film in response to threats hackers who launched a major attack on the studio over the past month.\n\nJust as Sony officially announced it wouldn't release \"The Interview,\" several news organizations reported that North Korea was behind the hack, citing unnamed sources close to the U.S. investigation.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday coupled with another mass of leaked emails, the hackers referenced Sept. 11 and warned people to stay away from theaters showing \"The Interview,\" which North Korea has previously condemned.\n\nThe comedy is about a TV host and producer recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Sony has been battered for weeks by continuous leaked emails, internal documents, financials, social security numbers and more.\n\nThe Seth Rogen and James Franco film, with a modest $45 million budget, is relatively small fare for Sony.\n\n\"It's not your typical 'X-Men' type of blockbuster where there are endless commercial tie-ins,\" says Jennifer Holt, a professor of film and media studies at the University of California.\n\nHolt says Sony will take a hit, but it was far riskier for the entire movie business if it was screened during Christmas.\n\n\"The Christmas season is a huge time for the movie business, and it's a time where they bring out all of their marquee films, so this is a very big revenue period,\" says Holt.\n\nEric Wold, analyst with B. Riley & Co., estimates movies will bring in about $2.5 billion in revenue during the last quarter of the year. \"The Interview\" potentially represented just 2 percent of that, Wold says, while representing an outsize threat to theater chains' bottom line.\n\n\"If moviegoers themselves are concerned that something could happen, even if they are not planning to see that movie, they may skip going to the theater altogether to see 'The Hobbit' or some other movie coming out,\" says Wold.\n\nTheaters can easily replace Sony's film with one of the big Christmas movies being released next week, and likely avoid a financial hit, says Wold. For that reason, he says, it makes sense for exhibitors to pull out of screening \"The Interview.\"\n\nBut Jason Squire, a film professor at USC and editor of \"The Movie Business Book,\" says the implications go far beyond this one film.\n\n\"This is really going to have a negative impact on what is an artistic business venture,\" Squire says.\n\nBecause of the Sony hack, movie studios are likely to become more cautious about the content of their films in the future, he says.",

Carmike, the fourth-largest U.S. theater chain with more than 2,000 screens, told Sony yesterday that it wouldn't play the movie, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nSony Hack Sony Frees Theaters to Skip Film Amid Threat Sony Pictures CEO: 'This Won't Take Us Down' Hack of Studio Head's Emails Stuns Industry Victims of Sony Breach Left Fuming Sony's Legal Threats in Hacking Scandal Face Hurdle North Korea Denies Direct Role in Hacking Sony Pictures Sony Hack Exposed Personal Data of Hollywood Stars\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating threats made online Tuesday against theaters that play \"The Interview.\" The threats were posted online by people claiming to be the same group that hacked Sony Pictures computer systems and released reams of internal documents and emails onto the Internet.\n\nThe hackers are believed by government and corporate investigators to be associated with North Korea. \"The Interview,\" a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, is about two television journalists recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe three biggest exhibition companies made their decision on a conference call Wednesday morning organized by their trade group, the National Association of Theatre Owners. The exhibitors were concerned about the safety of their theaters and the possibility that the threats would depress ticket sales for all movies during the critical holiday season, said a person with knowledge of the call.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that the threat of a terrorist attack on movie theaters wasn't credible.\n\nTheater operators on Tuesday urged Sony Pictures to delay the opening of the film, one of the people said. The Sony Corp. unit instead decided to stick with its plan to debut the film on Christmas Day, but to allow theaters to opt out without penalty from their commitments to play it.\n\nTypically, theaters aren't able to cancel a movie release by a major studio a week before it opens.\n\nThe decision by major chains not to play \"The Interview\" is virtually certain to force Sony to cancel the release entirely. The studio must now decide whether to put it back into theaters at a later date, or perhaps forego a theatrical release and put the film out via video-on-demand or online.\n\nWrite to Erich Schwartzel at erich.schwartzel@wsj.com and Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com",

Dr. Kevin Sauter is a media professor at the University of Saint Thomas.\n\nRELATED: North Korea behind Sony hack\n\nRELATED: Sony pulls 'The Interview' following threats\n\nRELATED: Minnesota theaters pull 'The Interview' with Sony's support\n\nMost major theater chains decided not to show \"The Interview\" on their screens. Sony Pictures said they would not object to the actions, but, on Wednesday, the studio announced they were pulling the Dec. 25 release date of the movie.\n\n\"The Interview\" is billed as a comedy, but computer hackers have been determined to make sure that it ends in tragedy. The film is advertised as a farcical take on a fictional assassination of the dictator of North Korea.\n\n\"This situation seems to be a confluence of politics, entertainment, terrorism and cyber work,\" said Sauter. \"It is really a very unusual circumstance that I cannot recall happening very often, if ever.\"\n\nSauter also thinks reaction to the threats by Sony and the theater chains may be motivated, in part, by other events.\n\n\"One of the things that seems to be in play, too, is what happened in Sydney. You know, that the lone wolf and what happened in Aurora, it does not take much for some disaffected person to decide that this was going to be the topic that was going to push them into the limelight.\"\n\nFor those who think the studio and theaters might be overreacting to the hackers' threat, Sauter offered this observation.\n\n\"It does not work very well with our general value system that we are not going to let the terrorists win,\" said Sauter, \"but by the same token, if anybody ever called in a bomb threat to a school or a concert or a football game, they probably would cancel the event or engage in really heavy security.\"\n\nSony has not said when, or if, there will be a later release date for \"The Interview.\"\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.kare11.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/12/17/sony-movie-hackers-threats-sauter/20560169/",

But the studio chiefs added they would not object if they decided to cancel screenings, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nCarmike Cinemas, which has 278 theaters in 41 states, informed Sony late on Tuesday that it would not show the film, the person said. The movie theater chain operates the Carmike Cinema 16 Theatre on Catasauqua Road in Hanover Township, Lehigh County, the Promenade 16 at the Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley in Upper Saucon Township and the Fairgrounds 10 in Reading.\n\nOther major chains with local theaters, including Regal Entertainment Group and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., have not commented on their plans for airing \"The Interview.\" All three chains list the movie on their websites, with Regal and Carmike providing showtimes.\n\nThe National Association of Theatre Owners had no comment about pulling of the film by its members. Neither Sony nor representatives from Carmike responded to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. security agencies are investigating a hacking group that carried out the cyberattack in November that severely damaged the movie studio's network and published damaging internal emails, unreleased films and employee data online. The group published what appeared to be more internal emails on Tuesday.\n\nMarc Maiffret, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm BeyondTrust, said he believed it was the first time a film screening had been pulled in the wake of a high-profile cyberattack.\n\n\"If they pulled the premiere because of the hacking, it's troubling,\" Maiffret said. \"The moment you start reacting is the moment you give them more power.\"\n\nSony is already reeling from the disclosures in documents released by the hackers, which have publicly exposed internal discussions important to the company's future.\n\nReuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the more than 100 gigabytes of documents that have been distributed via the Internet. The company has confirmed that at least some are authentic, apologizing for the loss of sensitive employee data and some comments made by executives.\n\nThe newest file published Tuesday appeared to be emails from Sony studio chief Michael Lynton. One email showed Lynton consulted with a senior official in the U.S. State Department in June this year, days after North Korea threatened \"merciless countermeasures\" over the release of the film.\n\nSeveral rounds of leaked emails have prompted apologies for disparaging remarks that executives made about celebrities. The leaks have included a James Bond script, high-quality digital copies of films that have yet to be released and private employee data.\n\nSony has also been sued by self-described former employees who accuse Sony of failing to properly protect their personal data. Sony declined comment on the lawsuit.\n\nWhile U.S. officials have cast doubt on a threat against theaters planning to show the film, police said they would take extra precautions.\n\nThe note was part of a series of leaks from unidentified hackers who have exposed thousands of internal documents and emails to public scrutiny. Reuters has not been able to verify the authenticity of the documents, though Sony has confirmed that at least some are authentic.\n\n\"I explained that we wanted to act in a responsible fashion and that the film was designed to entertain and not to make a political statement,\" Lynton said, in an email dated June 26 this year to Sony General Counsel Nicole Seligman.\n\nSony Pictures parent Sony Corp declined to comment on Lynton's exchange.

                    "body": "Sony acted to drop plans for a Christmas Day release of the film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen (with a key part for Lizzy Caplan) after the nation's bigger theater chains said they weren't going to screen the movie because of hacker threats. Sony said it would not hold the theater owners to their contracts. This is the biggest reaction yet to the hacker attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment in a massive theft and extortion plot that still does not have clear motives or perpetrators.\n\nCommunications from possible hackers threatened violence at theaters if the film about an assassination of North Korea ruler Kim Jong-un ran as scheduled. After leading chains such as AMC, Cinemark, Carmike and Regal Entertainment decided not to open the film on Christmas, Sony said in a statement today that \"we respect and understand our partners' decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers.\"\n\nPressure came from the shopping malls where theaters are located, and from studio competitors upset about the impact of Sony's troubles on the rest of the industry. Filmmaker Judd Apatow reacted to Sony's decision with a fiery string of tweets calling the move \"disgraceful.\"\n\nThe New York Times take:\n\nOn Tuesday a threat of terrorism against theaters that show \"The Interview\" was made in rambling emails sent to various news outlets. The threat read in part, \"Remember the 11th of September 2001.\" The emails aimed the threat at \"the very times and places\" at which \"The Interview\" was to play in its early showings.\n\nOnce the hackers threatened physical violence, the film's cancellation became almost inevitable, even though Sony had spent a day maintaining its plans for the release and premiere. Since the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting in 2012, Cinemark had fought lawsuits with a defense that said the incident was not foreseeable -- a stance that would have been virtually impossible with \"The Interview.\"\n\nThe film's collapse stirred considerable animosity among Hollywood companies and players. Theater owners were angry that they had been boxed into leading the pullback. Executives at competing studios privately complained that Sony should have acted sooner or avoided making the film altogether....\n\nThe incident is likely to be remembered as a failure of Hollywood leadership. As the attack progressed, both studios and the industry's Washington-based trade associations -- the theater association and the Motion Picture Association of America -- remained in a defensive posture, and ultimately found no way to save the film or to stem the flow of Sony's private data, which has been released online by hackers in waves since Nov. 24.\n\nWired magazine today posted a story headlined North Korea Almost Certainly Did Not Hack Sony, but the hed is a reach. The story makes a few surmises and contains the good point that the initial communications from the hackers did not mention \"The Interview,\" but Wired offers really nothing educated about who is behind the attack. So it remains a mystery.\n\nAlso today, New Regency has dropped plans for a North Korea-set thriller that was to star Steve Carrell, the Hollywood Reporter says.",

                    "body": "Sony Pictures Entertainment has cancelled the Christmas-day release of The Interview, bowing to threats of a wide-scale attack from the hackers that have tormented it for weeks.\n\nSony said in a statement Wednesday it is \"deeply saddened at [the hackers'] brazen effort\" to suppress the movie, and opted \"not to move forward\" with the Dec. 25 release.\n\nBefore that, the largest five theater circuits -- Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, Cinemark, Carmike Cinemas and Cineplex Entertainment -- said they would delay the $44 million film. It's unclear when the film will premiere.\n\nRegal, the nation's largest, said it would delay the screening \"due to the wavering support of the film\" by Sony, \"as well as the ambiguous nature\" of the threats. Cinexplex said it \"takes seriously its commitment to the freedom of artistic expression,\" but added that safety was paramount due to the \"unprecedented and complex situation.\"\n\nThat a anonymous hacking squad could derail the plans for one of the world's biggest entertainment firms, experts said, marks a worrying new precedent for cyberterror that could encourage even more attacks. With one inexpensive hack, a team of cybercriminals can generate the kinds of international fear once only achievable through bomb or terror threats.\n\n\"This is the real danger to corporate America in the cyber domain,\" said Alec Ross, a senior fellow at Columbia University's School of International & Public Affairs. \"The cost to build powerful malignant weapons is shockingly low. There are very well-developed communities of hackers for hire all over the world that can develop very powerful cyberweapons for exceedingly low costs.\"\n\nGuardians of Peace, the group claiming responsibility for the Sony hack, issued a sharp warning this week promising a \"bitter fate\" for viewers of the movie and warning others \"to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.\"\n\n\"The world will be full of fear,\" they said in an anonymous online posting. \"Remember the 11th of September 2001.\"\n\nThough some U.S. investigators have blamed North Korea for the hack, the nation has denied involvement. The reclusive government, however, has called it \"a righteous deed\" and threatened to undertake \"a merciless countermeasure\" due to the film's premiere.\n\nThe North Korean government has called the Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy, which ends with the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a \"most blatant act of terrorism and war.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday there is no credible evidence suggesting an active plot against American movie theaters in connection with the hack.\n\nStill, Bow Tie Cinemas, a smaller chain that runs 55 theaters across six states, said in a statement Wednesday it was \"saddened and angered by recent threats of terrorism\" and, \"given that the source and credibility of these threats is unknown,\" the chain would cancel the movie's Christmas premiere.\n\nThat decision brought its own backlash, as people took to Facebook to call the chain \"cowards\" for \"kowtowing\" to the threats. Bow Tie spokesman Joe Masher said in response, \"The safety of our patrons and staff are our number one priority. Period. It was a difficult decision for us to make.\"\n\nSony this week told theater chains it \"wouldn't object\" if they cancelled screenings. The movie's East Coast premiere, scheduled for Thursday at Landmark Theatres' Sunshine Cinema in New York, was also canceled, though the movie's Los Angeles happened without incident last week.\n\nNeither Sony nor theaters would say how long that delay could last. The National Association of Theatre Owners said in a statement that its member theaters \"may decide to delay exhibition\" until \"the responsible criminals are apprehended.\"\n\nWith the premiere scuttled, Sony could choose to unveil the film later in theaters or elect to skip the big screen altogether, by releasing via video-on-demand. That would upend a longtime agreement between theaters and film studios, traditionally demanding months-long delays between big-screen premieres and at-home viewing.",

AAFES has not received any command requests for the movie, he added.\n\nThe Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy had been scheduled for release in the U.S. on Christmas Day. The impending release had angered North Korea, where any criticism of dictator Kim Jong Un is considered virtual heresy. Pyongyang last summer called the production of the movie \"an act of war.\"\n\nThe movie was also considered politically sensitive in Japan and South Korea, which both fall within range of Pyongyang's missiles.\n\nIn the past few weeks, hackers from the anonymous group Guardians of Peace have targeted Sony and released a number of embarrassing internal emails. Following threats against theaters that decide to show the movie, Sony announced Wednesday that it would pull the film.\n\nU.S. investigators have linked the hacking and threats to North Korea and plan to release additional details in the future, according to an anonymous official cited by The Associated Press.\n\nHad Sony not decided this week to pull the movie, servicemembers stationed in the Pacific would not have been able to see it. Ward said Sony had decided not to release the movie in Asia.\n\nFirst-run movies that will be shown at Exchange theaters outside the U.S. from Dec. 17-31 are \"The Hobbit,\" \"Annie,\" \"Night at the Museum,\" \"Into the Woods,\" and \"Unbroken.\"\n\nAt its theaters in the U.S., AAFES will show \"Dumb and Dumber To\" and \"Beyond the Lights\" the week of Dec. 19; and the \"The Theory of Everything\" and \"Horrible Bosses 2\" the week of Dec. 26.",

Ed Araquel/AP\n\nFollowing ongoing online hacks and threats to attack screenings of \"The Interview,\" the Sony Pictures conflict reached a new level of havoc Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAfter afternoon cancellations of earlier agreements to screen it by four of the nation's largest movie theater chains, Sony cancelled the film's scheduled Christmas Day opening. Earlier in the day the studio withdrew scheduled press screenings. It appears that there are no plans for any type of theatrical exhibition.\n\nThe $42 million film, a satiric political comedy, stars James Franco and Seth Rogan as TV journalists recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. It was called \"an evil act of provocation against our highly dignified republic\" in late November on Uriminzokkiri, a North Korean government-controlled website. While Kim announced \"merciless counter-measures\" if the film was released, North Korea has denied involvement in the anonymous corporate hacks.\n\nThe U.S. movie theater chain leaders AMC, Carmike, Cinemark and Regal announced earlier Wednesday that they had abandoned their bookings.\n\n\"In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film 'The Interview,' we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release,\" Sony announced in a written statement Wednesday.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public. We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.\"\n\nThe film debuted at the Ace Hotel theater in Los Angeles for press and film executives last week to uneven reaction. Online critic Jeff Wells wrote after the screening, \"I never once laughed. Yes, the opening 20 or 25 minutes is mildly entertaining and yes, at heart 'The Interview' is anti-Kim, pro-anti-Kim revolution and pre-people power and all that, but it never rises above the level of a good-enough programmer.\"",

Of course not. Yet a threat by an anonymous group of hackers led the country's major theater chains to close their doors to \"The Interview,\" Sony Pictures' edgy comedy about a planned assassination of North Korea's Kim Jong Un. The hackers are engaged in terrorism, pure and simple, in an effort to stop people from seeing the movie. But even though the terrorists won this round, Sony still can -- and should -- make the movie widely available through other means.\n\nThe so-called Guardians of Peace, whom U.S. intelligence officials have reportedly linked to the North Korean government, assaulted Sony's computer network in late November, stealing files and erasing hard drives. After titillating industry-watchers for a few weeks by leaking embarrassing emails and sensitive personal information about Sony employees -- as well as exposing rank-and-file studio employees to identity theft by releasing their Social Security numbers -- the hackers upped the ante this week by promising a \"bitter fate\" to those who see the movie. \"Remember the 11th of September 2001,\" the group said. \"We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places [that show \"The Interview\"] at that time.\"\n\nThe nation's five largest theater chains dropped the film within a day, saying they wanted to wait until federal authorities had completed their investigation or the hackers had been caught. Sony responded Wednesday by announcing that it would not release the film to theaters next week, with no hint as to its future plans.\n\nConsidering the Guardians' demonstrable ability to wreak havoc digitally and the potential -- however remote -- that someone could get hurt, theater owners are in a very tough spot. Yet if the hackers succeed in keeping \"The Interview\" out of theaters, it will surely not be the last time a group with an ax to grind makes such a threat. And there's no shortage of people around the world with axes to grind.\n\nSony can make the best of a bad situation by borrowing a tactic increasingly used by independent studios. It should make \"The Interview\" available through online and pay-TV video-on-demand services, which don't lend themselves to a headline-grabbing attack the way a crowded multiplex might. And if the studio really wanted to stick it to the Guardians, it would offer the movie at a price designed to maximize the number of viewers, not necessarily the revenue collected.\n\nJudging from the early reviews, \"The Interview\" probably isn't worth the fuss. But the hackers picked this fight, threatening not just a single Hollywood studio but the millions of Americans likely to go to a movie during the holidays. And no matter what you think of the people behind \"The Interview,\" they represent any artist whose work may offend someone in power. That's the sort of speech we can't afford to have squelched.",

                    "body": "Earlier today, the five largest movie theater chains in the country decided that they would not, in fact, show The Interview, a movie about a large scruffy man and a dazed handsome man who assassinate North Korea's Kim Jong-un. The retreat prompted Sony Pictures to cancel the movie's premiere altogether. And the ramifications of that choice are going to be felt for a long, long time.\n\nThe Sony hack had already caused unprecedented damage. The studio it targeted was embarrassed, its secrets exposed. Past and present employees found themselves to be collateral damage, their medical histories, financial information, and intimate moments providing toxic flotsam for the flood. It had been, by any measure, the absolute worst case scenario. But even then, it was at least somewhat self-contained, quarantined by the singular, obsessive focus of those responsible. The hackers wanted to destroy Sony Pictures, full stop. That's ambitious, but at least it has defined limits.\n\nCracks in that quarantine began to form yesterday, when the threat suddenly mutated from digital theft to physical violence. All it took was one simple, grammatically jagged note from the \"Guardians of Peace,\" as the Sony Pictures hackers call themselves, to set events in motion:\n\nWe will clearly show it to you at the very time and places \"The Interview\" be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to.\n\nSoon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made.\n\nThe world will be full of fear.\n\nRemember the 11th of September 2001.\n\nWe recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time.\n\n(If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\n\nA little more than 24 hours later, movie theaters caved. It was a matter of minutes before Sony pulled the plug entirely.\n\nIt's not surprising that the theaters turned tail, and frankly it's hard to blame them. No matter how little credibility the threat had -- the Department of Homeland Security quickly dismissed it -- their obligations are to their business and to their customers, who have a vested interest in not being liable or blown up, respectively. The holiday weekend that The Interview was supposed to debut is also critical for the bottom line; last year's equivalent saw a $190 million in box office sales. That's a lot of Into the Woods fans to drive away.\n\nAnd even setting aside the financial impact, if you're going to take even the remotest risk with people's lives over artistic principles, you probably don't want it to be over this:\n\nSo I get it. I understand. Especially if you can convince yourself that the core principle at stake is whether people will people get to see The Interview. That's not, though, the core principle at stake. The core principle is that giving into the demands of an anonymous group of chaos-wielding bad guys will only create more anonymous groups of chaos-wielding bad guys. It's that succumbing to threats, even when it involves a movie you couldn't care less about, only breeds more threats.\n\nIt's an obvious point, but it's also no longer an abstraction. Sony's not going to make The Interview available on streaming or on demand. Deadline reported earlier that a Steve Carrell thriller based in North Korea has been canceled after the Sony fallout. Financing any major motion picture that even mentions the Hermit Kingdom will be impossible for years.\n\nWorse than that, though, is that the Sony hackers have written the playbook for how to silence any disagreeable voice. It's nothing new to make a threat, but today those threats can find an audience as large as the internet itself. Scaring a CEO is nothing compared to scaring her customers.\n\nThe theaters all know this. Sony knows it too. They still made their choice. And they'll keep making it in the future, by pursuing safer stories, by making smaller waves. Other companies in other fields will as well. The worst part about letting the hackers win this time is that it means they'll keep winning, over and over, without even having to play.",

But the Internet might be able to save it as well.\n\nMost major U.S. movie chains have postponed the film's Christmas day premiere, so Sony Pictures has few options as to how to release the controversial Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy.\n\nWednesday afternoon, Sony announced it was dropping the film's theatrical release.\n\nSony could just release it on Netflix and via on-demand pay-TV services like Comcast.\n\n\"Sony should fight fire with fire: Make 'The Interview' available online, for free, on every pirate site in the world. In HD,\" said Digital Disrupton author James McQuivey in a tweet to CNN's Brian Stelter.\n\nPlenty of studios release straight to streaming and pay-TV all the time, but usually with smaller, low-budget films. \"The Interview\" is expected to make big money at the box office.\n\nFor instance, the sequel to the 2000 hit \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" is slated to be released simultaneously in theaters and on Netflix in August 2015.\n\nSony's crisis may mean it has to test this release strategy, which many believe will be the future of film distribution, with a major movie.\n\nBut video-on-demand services may hesitate to show \"The Interview\" in order to avoid repercussions from the hackers.\n\nAnd \"The Interview\" had a $44 million budget, which would be difficult to recoup without showing it in theaters.\n\nUntil now, major studios have mostly avoided releasing films in theaters and on demand on the same day.\n\nBut now that Regal, Cinemark and other theater chains have delayed the film's opening, releasing it on demand may be Sony's best option.\n\nSony and Netflix declined comment for this story.",

We can debate for hours over whether or not this was the best course of action, but the fact remains there has never been more buzz for The Interview than there is right now. Despite all their best efforts to bury this film, the hackers currently attacking Sony have only made more people curious about the latest comedic romp from James Franco and Seth Rogen. Even people who don't usually see movies with these stars want to see The Interview, and as word gets out about the cancelled Christmas Day release that demand will only continue to grow.\n\nI know working at Sony right now is probably not too unlike living in hell, but if someone in power can look up from the flood of headlines being generated from tidbits found in leaked company documents they may realize a unique opportunity stands before them. For years people have been talking about Video On Demand (VOD) becoming a more prominent part of the entertainment discussion, and following the success of Snowpiercer earlier this year I think it's safe to say that is exactly what has happened. Most people know what VOD is at this point, and a good portion have used it at least once. Sony could avoid making theater chains nervous and potentially further enrage the hackers currently tearing them apart by acknowledging this and releasing The Interview in the near future. Christmas Day may be a bit too short of notice, but it's not outside the realm of possibilities to believe Sony could get The Interview on a service like iTunes or Amazon before the end of 2014. That would allow everyone the ability to see it while removing the ability for these so-called cyber terrorists to target large gatherings of cinema fans. Everyone wins.\n\nIf you work at Sony right now and you're reading this, PLEASE print off this story and take it to your immediate supervisor. If they don't understand the potential goldmine they're sitting on, take it to the person above them. Someone has to understand the demand for this movie will never be higher than it is right now, and though some may think it risky the smart business move would be to make the film available to those who want to see it. If not, I don't know if there is any hope for Sony to come out of this with its head held high. You were bullied and did nothing to fight back. In fact, you let the bully win.\n\nDon't let the bully win. Take control of your company and tell hackers to buzz off by making The Interview available to watch from the comfort of any consumer's home. Please.",

Expect similar future actions by other groups offended by a movie's subject, or by other creative works for that matter.\n\nAs far as setting bad precedents, it doesn't get much worse than this.\n\nThe threats against Sony Pictures and theaters that would dare show the comedy, \"The Interview,\" were contained in emails sent Tuesday to various news organizations. Preceding the warning, in what was an apparent attempt to unnerve Sony, hackers accessed and publicly disseminated internal Sony emails and medical, salary and other personal employee information. The cyberattacks are almost certainly tied to the North Korean government.\n\n\"Remember the 11th of September 2001,\" read one of the threats, which also warned moviegoers and neighbors to \"keep yourself distant\" from theaters that carry the movie, which had been set for general release Christmas Day. Quickly, the New York City premiere, set for this week, was canceled, as were promotional appearances by stars Seth Rogen and James Franco.\n\nOn Wednesday, major theater chains began announcing they would not carry \"The Interview,\" fearful moviegoers would stay away and lower turnout for all the movies at their multiscreen cinemas.\n\nAround 5 p.m., Sony announced it too would surrender to the bullying by pulling the Dec. 25 release.\n\n\"We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression,\" added the release.\n\nFunny way of showing it.\n\n\"The Interview\" is hardly highbrow art. The New York Times describes it as a \"raunchy comedy.\" It was needlessly provocative to have the two bumbling main characters depicted as plotting to kill a sitting world leader, Mr. Jong-un. The screenplay could have created a fictional character, easily recognizable as Mr. Jong-un, to make its laughs.\n\nThat being said, the decision to kowtow to these threats is a terrible one and will only invite more such actions.",

In addition, the loss of box office revenue and a disrupted marketing campaign will cost millions in further damages. However, the film could still be released exclusively on VOD, which would be the first wide release of its kind to have an all-digital theatrical on demand distribution.\n\nIt's clear that the threat of violence against movie theaters has been a decisive factor in this decision despite the Department for Homeland Security stating there is no perceived intelligence of a plot.

In the mean time, other studios, according to Recode.net, are urging Sony to halt the release in the concern that it may cause people to stay away from other films at theaters during and after Christmas, which is traditionally a big movie weekend.\n\nRelease it online\n\nSo, here's my proposal. Sony should release the movie online.\n\nAs film buffs know, studios typically have a series of \"release windows\" for a film's distribution that starts with theaters and, over time, moves to airline showings, premium cable/satellite channels and online distribution and other \"video on demand\" services, but not necessarily in that order. Some, including Mark Cuban (who owns Landmark Theaters) have called for simultaneous release of movies, but the practice hasn't caught on for most studios, especially for high-budget films.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue",

A version posted by The Hollywood Reporter said, in part: \"Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you'd better leave.)\"\n\nThe email specifically aimed its threat at \"the very times and places\" at which The Interview is to be first shown. The film is set for release on Christmas Day.\n\nLast night, Landmark's Sunshine Cinema said it had cancelled the film's New York premiere scheduled for this week; its Los Angeles premiere was held on December 11 without incident.\n\nThat email warning turned a continuing attack on Sony by hackers from a matter of theft to one of terrorism. A spokeswoman for the FBI said it \"is aware of the threat and is continuing to investigate the attack on Sony\".\n\nLate yesterday, a person with knowledge of Sony's dealings said that the theatre chain Carmike Cinemas had cancelled its showings of the movie. Carmike could not be reached for comment.\n\nA homeland security official said the department was analysing the threat but as yet had found no clear indication of an active plot against theaters. Sony had no comment.\n\nYesterday's development posed an ugly dilemma for Sony and exhibitors: whether to pull The Interview, caving to hackers who have wreaked havoc with Sony's digital systems for weeks in an attempt to block the release, or to forge ahead, risking possible violence and potential legal liability. In an already-fragile industry, studio executives privately voiced concern that any theatre violence could swing the market further toward home viewing.\n\nSeveral people briefed on Sony's internal discussions yesterday said the studio was not withdrawing the film but had told theatre owners that it would not object if they cancelled or avoided booking The Interview. Those people spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTheatre owners have been particularly pressed by the operators of malls and stores within them to avoid the film, two of those people said.\n\nAn executive for one of the theatre chains, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, called the invocation of the 9/11 terror attacks by hackers \"a game changer\".\n\nThe executive last week dismissed the notion that theatre owners might shy away from The Interview over earlier, more general threats by North Korean officials and pressure from the hackers, who have called themselves the Guardians of Peace. Nobody yet knows the hackers' true identity.\n\nRepresentatives of AMC Entertainment, Regal Entertainment and Cinemark, North America's three largest theatre chains, did not respond to queries. A spokesman for the National Association of Theatre Owners, which represents exhibitors, declined to comment.\n\nPressure to pull the The Interview, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and is directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, has centred on its depiction of Kim's assassination. To depict the killing of a sitting world leader, comically or otherwise, is virtually without precedent in major studio movies, film historians say. Rogen cancelled planned publicity interviews yesterday.\n\nBut a broad threat of theatre violence, following a sustained attack on Sony's digital existence, is also without precedent, and opens a new range of worry for Hollywood.",

WISN 12 News reporter Terry Sater also talked to movie goers.\n\n\"Obviously, we live in a country where typically it's not smiled upon to cower to terrorist threats, that kind of thing.

Sony Pictures announced Wednesday it's pulling its planned release of the movie \"The Interview\" -- the controversial movie starring Seth Rogan and James Franco.\n\nFirst the nation's biggest theater chains decided not to release the movie on Christmas because of threats from hackers. Then Sony decided to pull it altogether.\n\n\"I seen some clips of it, and I thought it was pretty funny,\" said moviegoer Peter Dyczkiewycz.\n\nREAD MORE: Sony pulls release of 'The Interview'\n\nThe plot for this funny movie includes the attempted assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Hackers threatened a 9/11-type attack on theaters that showed the movie.\n\n\"Really? They're pulling it? Oh wow! I was expecting that but I guess it's a good thing we don't cause too many issues, especially in the movie theater,\" said Faith Speight.\n\n\"I think it's a bad decision,\" said Dyczkiewycz. \"I think people should make up their own minds.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this before. There's always been controversy but never something where a studio says 'Listen, you don't have to show.' Usually they like controversy because that will draw an audience but they really don't want that audience to come because of the threats that have been made,\" said Ivan Schwarz, who helps decide which movies come to Cleveland.\n\nHe says this announcement will have a global impact of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nHe says if Sony ever does release it outside of theaters, they'll make their money back, but those theaters won't.\n\n\"Theater owners always want a blockbuster because the more people they can get into seats at the beginning, the more people that can get to buy popcorn and soda, the better,\" Schwarz said.\n\nWe asked Schwarz what this means for movies in the future.\n\nHe says Sony probably already had a very strong firewall before this hack, so every executive in the movie industry and maybe throughout corporate america is double and triple checking how they are protected.\n\n\"I think if you are an executive in corporate America right now you're spending most of your days hitting the delete key, knowing the capabilities of people around the world to be able to do this and break into a major corporation,\" said Schwarz. \"Having that much access to a major corporation is scary. I think it's going to change the way people do business in corporate America, not just the film industry.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/16uDkQ4",

                    "body": "Yesterday afternoon, communications allegedly coming from the so-called \"Guardians For Peace\" group, the same folks that allegedly hacked into Sony Pictures Entertainment's network and leaked an ungodly amount of private information and personal emails, issued an explicit terrorist threat. Of course, I would argue that stealing sensitive information and leaking it to the press as a means to torment and punish Sony for producing The Interview and to persuade them not to release it as scheduled in theaters counts as terrorism too, but I digress.\n\nThe group issued a vaguely worded threat that invoked 9/11 and threatened to do harm to theaters showing the film in theaters on Christmas Day. By Tuesday afternoon, Sony had announced that it wouldn't be opposed if theater chains chose not to run the film next Thursday. By Tuesday night, Carmike Cinemas, one of the largest chains in the country with 278 theaters and 2,917 screens in 41 states, had announced that they would not be showing the film next week. As of 10:30pm on Tuesday, Arclight may or may not be pulling the film too. And to be honest... I don't know what to say.\n\nI would love to call the the theater owners cowards and scream to high heaven that they can't give in to these terrorist demands. I would love to say that they are setting a terrible precedent in by pulling the movie out of fear from a threat that is in all likelihood smoke-and-mirrors. I would love to merely declare that even though I have already seen the film that if it opens nationwide on Thursday as planned I will darn-well buy at least one ticket anyway as a sign of financial support. Make no mistake, if this threat has the desired effect of muting or outright preventing the theatrical release of The Interview, the precedent might utterly destroy the ability for Hollywood to produce films about any remotely hot button topic or merely leave the biggest blockbusters as the perfect pawn in every would-be nut job's newest quest for attention. I am terrified of the long-term implications if these schmucks win out, although you can argue that the damage done to Sony means they have already won and that studios will think twice before green-lighting anything politically challenging as a result.\n\nBut my moral outrage and idealism does not easily mesh with the reality of the situation, especially from a legal point-of-view. Carmike Cinemas and/or Arclight Cinemas is a private business and they can choose to show or not show any movie they want for any reason they choose. They are not a government and thus have no real obligation to \"not negotiate with terrorists\" or take the moral high ground. If they truly think showing The Interview will endanger their business and/or the safety of their guests, then it is difficult for me to get too high on my proverbial high horse and tell them to be courageous for the sake of a moral ideal. If someone is threatening mass violence against theaters showing The Interview next week, with the caveat that these people have already carried out incredibly successful cyber-attacks on their targets, it is not unreasonable for people inside and outside the industry to wonder if it's worth it to open what was supposed to be a goofy little comedy over one of the busiest box office weekends of the year.\n\nIf something \"bad\" did happen, or if enough moviegoers felt unsafe about going to the movies over the Christmas holiday, it could affect not just The Interview but a deluge of last-minute releases that are counting on those two weeks of \"weekdays that play like weekends\" to soak up grosses before the end of the year. What's at stake, aside from the potential safety for those in theaters over the holiday, is not just the box office earnings for The Interview but also Annie, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, Into the Woods, The Gambler, and Unbroken. And of course an attack on a movie theater would potentially leave moviegoers scared to go to the theaters over the long term. The Interview may well be a sacrificial lamb for the sake of the industry as a whole.\n\nI hope that the other theater chains don't give in to these terrorist demands and (obviously) I hope the film plays throughout the month of December unmolested. I hope that everyone who has spent the last few weeks laughing at Sony's misfortune, reveling in the \"juicy\" stolen information, and/or presuming that the hack was some kind of publicity stunt are thrilled with themselves right now. These digital bandits just threatened to murder civilians if said citizens chose to partake in the now-courageous action of going to a movie theater. That's the real tragedy of course. Making movies is not supposed to be an act of courage. Going to the movies is not supposed to be an act of defiance.\n\nWe like to pretend that South Park or The Daily Show is \"daring\" for exposing hypocrisy, or that blockbusters like Star Trek Into Darkness or Captain America: The Winter Soldier are \"courageous\" because of their politically-charged narratives. But in truth there is little real courage because there are (usually) few real consequences in America for offending those in power or offending the majority in a mainstream entertainment. That is a wonderful thing even if I'd argue that the reason for a lack of said consequences is that those in power know that ignoring such art is the best way to mitigate its social impact. Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Sony presumably didn't think that making The Interview would be a courageous act because what they do isn't supposed to be heroic. In America, the only thing at stake for filmmakers is money, and the only thing at stake for moviegoers is the price of a ticket and 2-3 hours of their time.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue",

The Commander-in-Chief made the comments in an ABC sit-down with David Muir before Sony announced it would no longer release The Interview in cinemas. Watch the video below.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, the hackers responsible for crippling Sony's online systems warned on Tuesday that moviegoers would face 9/11-style attacks when The Interview hit theaters later this month. The message prompted several cinema chains to cancel screenings of the film, before Sony pulled movie entirely on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBut prior to that decision, Obama was in favor of the public still heading to the cinema anyway. In a clip released Wednesday evening from his interview, the President is asked whether he views the hackers' message as a \"serious threat,\" and how \"concerned\" he is. Obama replies, \"The cyberattack is very serious. We're investigating it seriously.\"\n\n\"We'll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible, then we'll alert the public,\" says the President. \"But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.\" While seeing The Interview on the big screen is now no longer possible, there are plenty of other options currently in theaters, or slated to open on Christmas Day.

                    "body": "No one is arguing that The Interview is a great film -- or, having talked to some people who have seen it, even a good film. But over the past few weeks, it has stumbled into being a capital-I Important Film in spite of itself -- one people should have the option to see in a theater, on its usual release day, like any other film that isn't causing an international incident.\n\nBut how would the conversation around The Interview have been different if Seth Rogen and James Franco's movie were a prestige pic? If it were more like Hotel Rwanda or The Killing Fields and less like Pineapple Express or This is the End? If it were the equivalent of eating your cultural vegetables and not taking down a bacon cheeseburger with fries, would Sony and theater chains have defended it more?\n\nGranted, no groups affiliated with the atrocities portrayed in Hotel Rwanda or The Killing Fields ever threatened audiences who wanted to see those films. And maybe if the mass shooting at screening of The Dark Knight Rises in 2012 hadn't happened, the idea of an attack at a movie theater would seem more far-fetched. That doesn't make the threats of a nebulous hacker group any more real, though.\n\nIn the past 13 years, this country has used security as cover for a host of questionable behavior, and theater chains pulling the plug on The Interview reads less like concern for their customers and more like concern for their bottom line. (The New York Times notes that theaters also faced pressure from mall operators, who didn't want theaters at shopping centers to affect holiday business.) The United States hosted the Olympics in 2002, when security was hardly guaranteed; during the five preceding months, there had been the 9/11 attacks, the anthrax scare, the attempted shoe bombing of an American Airlines flight, and too many other vague threats to list here. But a threat from a supposed hacker group is all it takes to sink a film, even if the Department of Homeland Security has its doubts about what those threats mean.\n\nFor its part, Sony faced extraordinary pressure, and its cancellation of The Interview's theatrical release looked inevitable as the week progressed. In a way, Sony may have just Obi Wan-ed the movie: If it moves to VOD, The Interview could become far more successful than it would've been otherwise; a nation of people home for the holidays could choose to pass their time with that movie that caused all the commotion.\n\nThe Interview is just a goofy comedy, so what difference does it make that it isn't being released as planned? A big one: How we defend even our most trivial art reflects how much we actually believe in the freedoms we're always blathering about to the rest of the world. It doesn't take as much courage to defend something that's inarguably right or just as it does to defend something that's prurient or silly. Still, it has to be done, and not just because otherwise the terrorists win -- the go-to punchline of terror fatigue. It's because importance sometimes lurks in surprising places: In 1983, Hustler printed a parody ad where Jerry Falwell described having sex with his mother in an outhouse. It led to one of the most important First Amendment cases of the past 30 years.\n\nNo one thinks The Interview will be one of the most important films of the past 30 years. But look at it this way: When someone does finally write a big, important movie about North Korea -- the nation's equivalent of The Killing Fields -- will Hollywood be too skittish to make it?",

Guardianes de la Paz).\n\nLa decisi\u00f3n de Sony de cancelar el estreno de \"The Inteview\" se produce un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que GOP hiciera p\u00fablico un mensaje en el que hac\u00eda referencia a los atentados del 11 de septiembre de 2001 y amenazaba con llevar a cabo acciones similares en las salas que exhibieran la pel\u00edcula.\n\nLea: Cines ceden ante amenazas de hackers\n\nLa cinta producida por Sony Pictures es una parodia al r\u00e9gimen de Corea del Norte y en ella sus protagonistas -Seth Rogen y James Franco- dise\u00f1an un plan para asesinar al l\u00edder norcoreano Kim Jong-Un.\n\nEn las \u00faltimas semanas se ha especulado con la posibilidad de que Pyonyang est\u00e9 detr\u00e1s del hackeo, ya que hace unos meses el gobierno norcoreano calific\u00f3 a \"The Interview\" como \"un acto de guerra\".\n\nPese a ello, un funcionario de Corea del Norte neg\u00f3 hace unos d\u00edas que eso fuera cierto.\n\nLos miembros de GOP hicieron p\u00fablico este martes el \"regalo de navidad\" que hace unos d\u00edas hab\u00eda prometido para Sony Pictures.\n\nSe trata de un paquete de informaci\u00f3n robada de los sistemas inform\u00e1ticos del estudio que viene bajo el nombre de \"Michael Lynton\", presidente del estudio.\n\nSeg\u00fan informa la revista The Hollywood Reporter, esos archivos contienen m\u00e1s de 12.000 emails de la cuenta de correo electr\u00f3nico de Lynton, los m\u00e1s antiguos fechados en 2008.\n\nLos acontecimientos de las \u00faltimas horas se suman a la demanda presentada este lunes frente a una corte federal de California por dos exempleados de Sony Pictures contra el estudio, por \"no haber hecho lo suficiente\" para evitar que los piratas inform\u00e1ticos hicieran p\u00fablicos su informaci\u00f3n personal, como sus n\u00fameros de seguro social o sus expedientes m\u00e9dicos.\n\nCon el paso de los d\u00edas la gravedad del hackeo sufrido por Sony Pictures se ha ido haciendo cada vez m\u00e1s evidente y ha puesto en alerta a otros estudios de Hollywood, que temen ser v\u00edctimas de un ataque similar.\n\nEl pasado fin de semana los representantes legales de Sony Pictures pidieron en una carta a algunos de los medios m\u00e1s importantes de EE.UU. que detengan la publicaci\u00f3n de informaciones basadas en los documentos robados.\n\nEn la misiva, enviada a medios como Los Angeles Times, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter y The New York Times, el abogado David Boies exig\u00eda a las publicaciones que dejen de ofrecer la informaci\u00f3n contenida en los documentos filtrados y la destruyeran inmediatamente.\n\nVarios juristas citados por la prensa local indicaron que, en base a varias resoluciones de la Corte Suprema de EE.UU., la publicaci\u00f3n del material robado a Sony estar\u00eda justificada por la primera enmienda de la Constituci\u00f3n estadounidense, que protege la libertad de informaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn las \u00faltimas semanas, el grupo GOP ha filtrado numerosos documentos internos de Sony Pictures, algunos de los cuales conten\u00edan informaci\u00f3n privada de los empleados de la compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, hicieron p\u00fablicos algunos de los intercambios a trav\u00e9s de correos electr\u00f3nicos que los jefes del estudio tuvieron en los \u00faltimos meses con prominentes figuras de Hollywood y en los que estrellas como la actriz Angelina Jolie o el actor Kevin Hart no sal\u00edan bien parados.\n\nTambi\u00e9n filtraron varias pel\u00edculas pendientes de estrenar, as\u00ed como el guion de la \u00faltima pel\u00edcula de la serie de James Bond, \"Spectre\", cuya filmaci\u00f3n se inici\u00f3 hace unos d\u00edas.\n\nLa semana pasada, Amy Pascal, vicepresidenta de Sony Pictures, y el productor de Hollywood Scott Rudin, se disculparon por unos emails filtrados en los que ambos bromeaban con la raza del presidente de EE.UU. Barack Obama.\n\nMientras, a principios de diciembre algunos empleados de la compa\u00f1\u00eda recibieron correos electr\u00f3nicos an\u00f3nimos en los que se los amenaza a ellos y a sus familias.\n\nEn los emails se ped\u00eda a los trabajadores de Sony Pictures que rompan sus lazos con el estudio y les advert\u00edan que, de no hacerlo, \"no s\u00f3lo t\u00fa sino tambi\u00e9n tu familia estar\u00e1 en peligro\".",

La acusaci\u00f3n formal podr\u00eda hacerse el mismo jueves.\n\nEl gobierno de Corea del Norte ha negado cualquier vinculaci\u00f3n con el ciberataque, que seg\u00fan algunos expertos pudo haber sido ejecutado por empleados descontentos o por simpatizantes de Kim Jong-un ofendidos por la pel\u00edcula.\n\nEntretanto, Sony anunci\u00f3 la cancelaci\u00f3n del estreno de la pel\u00edcula (\"Una loca entrevista\" en Latinoam\u00e9rica), despu\u00e9s de que las principales cadenas de cines rechazaran proyectarla, una decisi\u00f3n que puede costarle mucho dinero teniendo en cuenta que la Navidad es una de las \u00e9pocas m\u00e1s importantes del a\u00f1o.\n\nLa compa\u00f1\u00eda tambi\u00e9n reconoci\u00f3 \"no tener planes para estrenar en el futuro\" esta comedia.\n\nDe esta forma tuvieron efecto las amenazas del autodenominado grupo GOP o Guardianes de la Paz (Guardians of Peace), que el martes evoc\u00f3 los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001 en una ominosa advertencia a los aficionados que fueran a ver la pel\u00edcula.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula de la discordia trata sobre un complot orquestado por la CIA para matar a Kim Jong-un, aprovechando que dos periodistas estadounidenses interpretados por James Franco y Seth Rogen logran un permiso para entrevistar al l\u00edder norcoreano.\n\n\"Recuerden (los ataques de) el 11 de septiembre de 2001\", advirtieron los piratas inform\u00e1ticos. \"Les recomendamos que se mantengan alejados de los cines.

Los ejecutivos de Sony han afirmado que no objetar\u00e1n de ning\u00fan modo esta decisi\u00f3n de los exhibidores. Carmike Cinemas otro exhibidor con 278 salas en todo el pa\u00eds tambi\u00e9n ha decidido no exhibir la pel\u00edcula. Sin embargo, algunos han decidido lo contrario, como Tom Stephenson, presidente de Look Cinemas que afirma que la censura nunca resulta un asunto positivo. Los protagonistas de la cinta James Franco y Seth Rogen tambi\u00e9n han declinado apariciones televisivas en los \"late nights\" de Jimmy Fallon y Seth Meyers.\n\nDatos personales\n\nY es que los Guardianes de la Paz no se dan por vencidos. El grupo acaba de sacar a la luz otro cargamento de e-mails de Sony como \"regalo de Navidad\" -como ellos mismos lo han denominado- en el que se incluye numerosos correos con informaci\u00f3n privada (n\u00fameros de la seguridad social, salarios) de los empleados. El pasado martes, dos ex trabajadores de Sony Pictures demandaron a la compa\u00f1\u00eda por carecer de un nivel adecuado de seguridad lo que provoc\u00f3 que toda su informaci\u00f3n personal circule por la red. El estudio intent\u00f3 contactar con diferentes medios de comunicaci\u00f3n para que no difundieran informaci\u00f3n comprometedora de algunos correos, pero el esfuerzo fue en vano. Algunos de estos emails han sido especialmente embarazosos para estrellas como Angelina Jolie y Leonardo Di Caprio. Corea del Norte ha negado su relaci\u00f3n con este ataque cibern\u00e9tico aunque la ha calificado como una acci\u00f3n honrada por parte de sus seguidores. Andrew Wallenstein, de la prestigiosa revista \"Variety\", afirma que la publicaci\u00f3n por parte de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n de los emails es una acci\u00f3n problem\u00e1tica pero necesaria.\n\nSeg\u00fan Mark Stevens, sheriff del condado de Los Angeles que acudi\u00f3 el pasado martes a la convenci\u00f3n sobre ciberataques en el Centro de Convenciones de Pasadena, es extremadamente dif\u00edcil perseguir este tipo de delitos, que est\u00e1n aumentando en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os , y el caso de Sony es solamente la punta del iceberg. Muchos consumidores y peque\u00f1os negocios tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n siendo \"hackeados\". Ponerse al d\u00eda con la tecnolog\u00eda utilizada es una ardua tarea. En la mayor parte de los casos uno no se entera hasta que es demasiado tarde. \"Perseguir y mantener unas estad\u00edsticas en lo que a ciber ataques se refiere es muy complicado. La mayor parte de las veces no se registra ni hay informes al respecto por lo que pasa medio desapercibido. En ocasiones el ordenador empieza a dar problemas y la persona ni siquiera se ha dado cuenta que su n\u00famero de tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito ha sido robado\", explica Stevens. \"La mayor parte de los routers de hoy en d\u00eda pueden bifurcarse conect\u00e1ndose a dos diferentes redes. Tienes la red principal y la \"guest\" operando desde el mismo aparato. Casi todos los c\u00edber ataques comienzan con \"phishing\", que es cuando recibes un email que parece normal por el origen del mismo pero que en realidad es de un hacker al que le est\u00e1s dando sin saberlo acceso a toda tu informaci\u00f3n personal\", concluye. Para Sony el problema acaba de comenzar y su presidente, Michael Lynton, ha tranquilizado a sus trabajadores: \"Este problema no nos va a hundir\", ha dicho.\n\nCuando Sony Pictures comenz\u00f3 a hacer el casting para \"The Interview\", en la que inclu\u00eda el asesinato del l\u00edder norcoreano Kim Jogn-un no sab\u00eda la repercusi\u00f3n que podr\u00eda tener. Ahora, algunos de sus ejecutivos afirman que sab\u00edan que pod\u00eda traer implicaciones y que ahora se dan cuenta que la comedia era m\u00e1s peligrosa de lo que hab\u00edan pensado. Lo cierto es que el dar luz verde a este proyecto provoc\u00f3 que Sony se haya metido en un verdadero l\u00edo geopol\u00edtico bastante delicado. Las violentas escenas del asesinato del l\u00edder norcoreano fueron, como era de esperar, tomadas como un ataque personal. Mientras que muchos americanos ven a Corea del Norte como un pa\u00eds lejano que no acaba de quitarles el sue\u00f1o, Jap\u00f3n lo tiene como una amenaza inminente. Kazuo Hirai, ejecutivo de Sony en el pa\u00eds nip\u00f3n, insisti\u00f3 en la necesidad de suavizar ciertas escenas del filme, en particular en la cual la cabeza del l\u00edder norcoreano explotaba. Al parecer Seth Rogen, actor y codirector del filme junto a Ewan Goldberg intentaron forzar la tuerca creativamente hablando y Sony lo acept\u00f3 con la \u00fanica intenci\u00f3n de que no se marcharan con el proyecto a otro estudio. Desgraciadamente a quien les ha explotado en la cara ha sido a ellos.",

Fuentes an\u00f3nimas del FBI citadas por The New York Times, CNN y Associated Press confirmaron por primera vez que Pyongyang est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s de la brutal represalia contra la compa\u00f1\u00eda por la pel\u00edcula La entrevista, una parodia sobre un intento de asesinato del presidente norcoreano, Kin Jong-un.\n\nLos medios estadounidenses afirman que los investigadores har\u00e1n un anuncio al respecto este jueves.\n\nHasta el momento, Corea del Norte ha negado su implicaci\u00f3n en el ataque y las amenazas posteriores, pero ha admitido que pueden ser seguidores suyos. El grupo de piratas inform\u00e1ticos envi\u00f3 este lunes una serie de amenazas a aquellos cines que proyectaran la pel\u00edcula, cuyo estreno estaba previsto para el pr\u00f3ximo 25 de diciembre. Los atacantes hicieron referencias al 11-S y advirtieron a la gente de que evitara los cines donde se proyectara la pel\u00edcula. Tras el anuncio de tres grandes cadenas de exhibici\u00f3n de que cancelaban la proyecci\u00f3n de La entrevista, Sony anunci\u00f3 este mi\u00e9rcoles que renuncia a estrenarla.\n\nAl tiempo que rebuscaban en los miles de documentos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda vertidos en la red, los expertos inform\u00e1ticos han estado investigando el origen del ataque. Jaime Blasco, presidente de la empresa AlienVault, comentaba hace una semana a EL PA\u00cdS que una parte del software maligno utilizado por los piratas inform\u00e1ticos contra Sony era igual a la utilizada en marzo de 2013 contra la banca surcoreana.\n\nEn aquel ataque, los bancos Jeju, NongHyup y Shinhan, as\u00ed como algunos medios surcoreanos, se vieron comprometidos en un ataque que borr\u00f3 datos internos. El Gobierno de Corea del Sur responsabiliz\u00f3 a Pyongyang inmediatamente, tras analizar el programa maligno utilizado. El ataque se llam\u00f3 dark Seoul y fue muy llamativo, recuerda Blasco. \"Est\u00e1 relacionado de alguna forma. No sabemos si uno de los que lo hicieron es el mismo que los de Sony, o si los de Sony aprendieron de estos, pero est\u00e1 relacionado\", concluye el experto. Blasco tambi\u00e9n afirmaba que el ataque demostraba \"un nivel de sofisticaci\u00f3n elevado\".",

La mofa del r\u00e9gimen dictatorial del pa\u00eds asi\u00e1tico desemboc\u00f3 hace unas semanas en un ataque cibern\u00e9tico masivo que expuso miles de archivos con informaci\u00f3n confidencial, adem\u00e1s de varios de sus t\u00edtulos sin estrenar. Y ahora, para rematar la cadena de infortunios, se han visto obligados a cancelar el estreno de la cinta protagonizada por Seth Rogen y James Franco hasta nuevo aviso.\n\nEl anuncio se produjo ayer despu\u00e9s de que las principales cadenas de cines del pa\u00eds decidieran no proyectar la pel\u00edcula tras las amenazas de los piratas inform\u00e1ticos, Guardians of the Peace, que a su vez se han declarado afines al gobierno norcoreano.\n\nEl mensaje de los hackers fue sido muy directo. \"El mundo estar\u00e1 repleto de miedo. Recuerden el 11 de septiembre\", amenazando con atacar cualquier sala de cine que decida proyectar la pel\u00edcula el pr\u00f3ximo 25 de diciembre, como estaba previsto inicialmente.\n\nDe momento, no hay planes para su estreno en el futuro, seg\u00fan Sony, con autoridades a nivel federal y estatal pendientes de los siguientes movimientos de los 'ciberacosadores'. El asunto, de acuerdo a la cadena CNN, podr\u00eda provocar incluso una reacci\u00f3n por parte de la Casa Blanca, convencidos de que en realidad el gobierno de Corea del Norte est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s del ataque a los estudios. De momento, est\u00e1n trabajando en probar que en realidad s\u00ed hubo intervenci\u00f3n por parte del pa\u00eds asi\u00e1tico, furioso por las escenas en las que ridiculizan su r\u00e9gimen y que ofrece una escena muy gr\u00e1fica sobre la muerte de su actual dictador.\n\nPopularidad\n\nMientras, algunos creen en Hollywood que la cinta terminar\u00e1 por ser a\u00fan m\u00e1s popular de lo que hubiera sido originalmente. \"Esto lo \u00fanico que garantiza es que esta pel\u00edcula sea vista por m\u00e1s personas en el planeta que antes. Legal o ilegalmente la van a ver\", coment\u00f3 el actor Judd Apatow a trav\u00e9s de su cuenta de Twitter.\n\nLo que parece dif\u00edcil es que Sony sea capaz de capitalizar ese fen\u00f3meno tras haber cancelado el estreno de 'The Interview'. Los analistas calculaban una recaudaci\u00f3n de entre 20 y 25 millones de d\u00f3lares solo en el primer fin de semana de fiestas navide\u00f1as, un dinero que seguramente ir\u00e1 a parar a otros de los t\u00edtulos con los que compet\u00eda ese d\u00eda. El 25 de diciembre se estrenan en Estados Unidos 'The Gambler', protagonizada por Mark Wahlberg, 'Into the Woods', con Meryl Streeo, y 'Unbroken', dirigida por Angelina Jolie.\n\nEst\u00e1 adem\u00e1s el asunto de las demandas colectivas de sus trabajadores que presuntamente tendr\u00e1 que afrontar Sony por no haber protegido de forma adecuada informaci\u00f3n privada como n\u00fameros de Seguridad Social o salarios. En total se han visto afectadas 47.000 personas entre empleados y ex empleados del estudio, una peque\u00f1a hecatombe para la compa\u00f1\u00eda con sede en Culver City, en el coraz\u00f3n de Los Angeles.",

As\u00ed lo aseguraron los medios estadounidenses de la CNN, NBC e incluso The New York Times.\n\nPUEDES VER: Cibercriminales que hackearon servidores de Sony piden que se cancele pel\u00edcula sobre Kim Jong-un\n\nDe acuerdo a fuentes consultadas por dichos medios, oficiales expertos llegaron a esta conclusi\u00f3n luego de analizar cuidadosamente el caso. La informaci\u00f3n contradice las declaraciones iniciales de la dictadura asi\u00e1tica que en un principio neg\u00f3 haber dirigido el ataque, pese a que una de las demandas principales de estos criminales fue la cancelaci\u00f3n del lanzamiento de una pel\u00edcula que parodiaba al lider norcoreano. Adem\u00e1s estos mismos realizaron amenazas terroristas contra las cadenas de cine que emitan dicha pel\u00edcula en sus salas lo que finalmente logr\u00f3 que Sony cediera y prefiriera retrasar su lanzamiento.\n\nPUEDES VER: Sony da marcha atr\u00e1s y retrasa lanzamiento de pel\u00edcula que parodia a Kim Jong-Un\n\nAunque a\u00fan no se sabe c\u00f3mo es que las autoridades norteamericanas lograron penetrar la casi impermeable red de computadoras norcoreanas (un proceso necesario si se quiere determinar la procedencia de los atacantes) lo cierto es que algunos detalles apuntan a Corea del Norte.\n\nFORENSES CIBERN\u00c9TICOS\n\nUn equipo estrella de especialistas estadounidenses en el campo de la seguridad cibern\u00e9tica encontraron una serie de coincidencias que hicieron que las invetigaciones tengan en la mira a la dictadura asi\u00e1tica. Para empezar, los cibercriminales usaron las mismas herramientas y t\u00e9cnicas usadas en ataques dirigidos a compa\u00f1\u00edas de medios de comunicaci\u00f3n y bancos de Arabia Saudita y Corea del Sur (expertos aseguran que en ambos casos los ataques provinieron de Corea del Norte).\n\nAdem\u00e1s, pese a que usaron computadoras al rededor del mundo para realizar el ataque, uno de los servidores (de Bolivia) fue usado en el ataque a Corea del Sur hace dos a\u00f1os. Adem\u00e1s el env\u00edo masivo de malware a trav\u00e9s de la misma compa\u00f1\u00eda es muy similar a lo que tambi\u00e9n sucedi\u00f3 con los bancos y medios surcoreanos en aquella ocasi\u00f3n.\n\nPor otra parte, el ataque a Saudi Aramco (una compa\u00f1\u00eda de medios saud\u00ed) en el que los hackers borraron informaci\u00f3n de 30 mil computadores de la empresa, es muy similar a lo ocurrido con Sony. Asimismo las herramientas usadas para borrar estos datos son los mismos en ambos casos.\n\nEL ANUNCIO SE HAR\u00c1 MA\u00d1ANA\n\nDe acuerdo con fuentes internas el gobierno confrontar\u00e1 al r\u00e9gimen de Kim Jong-Un ma\u00f1ana, lo que significar\u00eda un cambio en la pol\u00edtica del pa\u00eds americano que anteriormente hab\u00eda evitado comentar sobre los ciberataques que hab\u00eda recibido, pese a que expertos afirman que sab\u00edan de su procedencia. \u00bfComenzar\u00e1 la guerra cibern\u00e9tica?\n\nPor su parte, autoridades de Jap\u00f3n esperan que las autoridades de Estados Unidos se tomen las cosas con calma para evitar un conflicto diplom\u00e1tico que podr\u00eda afectar negativamente una negociaci\u00f3n con este pa\u00eds que busca que retornen unos ciudadanos nipones que fueron secuestrados en este lugar.\n\n(Con informaci\u00f3n de The New York Times, FayerWayer)",

Pero los datos obtenidos por la inteligencia estadounidense seg\u00fan funcionarios que no han querido hacer declaraciones oficiales, mencionan que al interior de la Casa Blanca a\u00fan se debate las acciones a tomar contra Corea del Norte a quien acusar\u00edan de terrorismo cibern\u00e9tico.\n\nEntre los datos que se han logrado conseguir est\u00e1 que los ataques fueron lanzados desde ordenadores en pa\u00edses como Singapur, Tailandia, Italia, Bolivia, Polonia y Chipre, pero el lenguaje utilizado coincide con el que usa la Unidad de Seguridad de Corea del Norte conocida como \"Oficina 121\".\n\nAdem\u00e1s de que este ataque no es propio de crackers que buscan conseguir informaci\u00f3n, esto va m\u00e1s all\u00e1, es mucho m\u00e1s sofisticado y cuenta con un gran parecido a lo que ha encontrado Estados Unidos en sus diversos esfuerzos por entrar en las operaciones inform\u00e1ticas de Corea del Norte. Pero esto no es todo, ya que los atacantes han usado herramientas y t\u00e9cnicas para limpiar todo rastro del ataque, mismas que han sido utilizadas en ocasiones anteriores en ataques contra bancos y compa\u00f1\u00edas, incluso uno de ellos fue en un inicio atribuido a Ir\u00e1n, pero las \u00faltimas investigaciones arrojan que se trata del gobierno de Kim Jong-Un.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, los oficiales mencionan que este ataque a Sony no fue obra cien por ciento de Corea del Norte y sus habilidades, ya que tambi\u00e9n se debe a que existen personas infiltradas en Sony Pictures quienes ayudaron con los nombres de los servidores y las credenciales administrativas para el despliegue del malware.\n\nLo curioso de todo esto es que Estados Unidos est\u00e9 dando a conocer esta informaci\u00f3n, acusando de manera p\u00fablica, pero no oficial, al pa\u00eds asi\u00e1tico, y es que nunca antes se hab\u00eda visto que Estados Unidos diera este tipo de datos y detalles tan delicados que ponen sobre aviso a su enemigo.\n\nLo importante de esto es que ya no estamos hablando de un ataque a una compa\u00f1\u00eda solamente, sino de temas de seguridad nacional que involucran a dos de las m\u00e1s grandes potencias equipadas con armamento b\u00e9lico, y es que como sabemos al interior del gobierno estadounidense hay diversas corrientes, unas que apuntan a la soluci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica y otras a la confrontaci\u00f3n directa, lo que dar\u00eda pie a esa confrontaci\u00f3n que tanto busca el gobierno de Kim Jong-Un en contra de Estados Unidos y Jap\u00f3n.\n\nVeamos cu\u00e1l es el desenlace de todo esto, que con toda esta nueva informaci\u00f3n parece que a\u00fan falta mucho por conocer.",

Corea del Norte ha negado p\u00c3\u00bablicamente estar involucrada.\n\nLos piratas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos no identificados exigieron que Sony cancelara el estreno de la pel\u00c3\u00adcula \"The Interview\", una comedia protagonizada por Seth Rogen y James Franco que incluye una macabra escena sobre el asesinato del l\u00c3\u00adder de Corea del Norte.\n\nSony cancel\u00c3\u00b3 el mi\u00c3\u00a9rcoles el estreno programado para el 25 de diciembre debido a la existencia de amenazas contra los asistentes a las salas de cine, y el estudio dijo posteriormente que no hab\u00c3\u00ada planes para exhibir la cinta en un futuro.\n\nLa revelaci\u00c3\u00b3n sobre el involucramiento de Corea del Norte se dio poco despu\u00c3\u00a9s que Sony contrat\u00c3\u00b3 a la unidad forense Mandiant, de la empresa especializada en seguridad cibern\u00c3\u00a9tica FireEye Inc., que el a\u00c3\u00b1o pasado public\u00c3\u00b3 un informe con evidencia que acusaba a una organizaci\u00c3\u00b3n del ej\u00c3\u00a9rcito chino, la Unidad 61398, de entrar clandestinamente en los sistemas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos de m\u00c3\u00a1s de 140 compa\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00adas a lo largo de varios a\u00c3\u00b1os.\n\nRastrear el origen de una intrusi\u00c3\u00b3n y la identidad de los responsables es sumamente dif\u00c3\u00adcil, y con frecuencia requiere evidencia circunstancial y suposiciones, pero el trabajo de Mandiant en torno a su investigaci\u00c3\u00b3n de China provee algunas pistas sobre sus m\u00c3\u00a9todos.\n\nLos investigadores desensamblan cualquier herramienta de pirater\u00c3\u00ada cibern\u00c3\u00a9tica dejada atr\u00c3\u00a1s y la revisan en busca que caracter\u00c3\u00adsticas \u00c3\u00banicas que pudieran decir qui\u00c3\u00a9n la construy\u00c3\u00b3 o la despleg\u00c3\u00b3.\n\nLas pistas sobre el origen podr\u00c3\u00adan incluir un c\u00c3\u00b3digo de programaci\u00c3\u00b3n, la manera en que fue activada, o la fecha y el lugar del mundo al que se transmitieron materiales robados.\n\nEn algunos casos, los investigadores rastrean las intrusiones a computadoras de \"comando y control\" o a servidores web, y las bit\u00c3\u00a1coras de esas m\u00c3\u00a1quinas o la informaci\u00c3\u00b3n de registro en internet podr\u00c3\u00adan brindar m\u00c3\u00a1s pistas sobre qui\u00c3\u00a9n podr\u00c3\u00ada ser el autor del ciberataque.\n\nA veces, los hackers son identificados en redes sociales o en salas de chat donde discuten objetivos o t\u00c3\u00a9cnicas. Mandiant nombr\u00c3\u00b3 a tres hackers del ej\u00c3\u00a9rcito chino, incluido uno conocido como \"Gorila Feo\".\n\nLas herramientas m\u00c3\u00a1s sofisticadas o t\u00c3\u00a9cnicas especializadas son atribuidas en general a la labor de gobiernos \u00e2\u0080\"tales como el papel desempe\u00c3\u00b1ado por Estados Unidos al dar a conocer una herramienta conocida como Stuxnet para da\u00c3\u00b1ar el programa nuclear de Ir\u00c3\u00a1n\u00e2\u0080\" porque puede ser caro desarrollarlas y requerir de tiempo.\n\nPero los gobiernos no utilizar\u00c3\u00adan sus herramientas m\u00c3\u00a1s sofisticadas contra blancos no sofisticados, debido al riesgo de que dichas herramientas valiosas sean descubiertas y su efectividad sea nulificada en caso de ataques futuros.\n\nHasta el momento se desconoc\u00c3\u00ada c\u00c3\u00b3mo responder\u00c3\u00ada el gobierno estadounidense. Bernadette Meehan, portavoz del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, dijo que Estados Unidos est\u00c3\u00a1 \"sopesando varias opciones\".\n\nLas opciones para hacer frente a Corea del Norte son hasta cierto punto limitadas dado que Estados Unidos ya tiene un embargo comercial hacia ese pa\u00c3\u00ads y casi con toda seguridad no tomar\u00c3\u00ada en cuenta una acci\u00c3\u00b3n militar, dijo Martin Libicki, experto en ciberseguridad en la Academia Naval de Estados Unidos y un erudito en la Rand Corp., instituci\u00c3\u00b3n sin fines de lucro dedicada a generar soluciones para mejorar las pol\u00c3\u00adticas p\u00c3\u00bablicas.\n\nEn mayo, el Departamento de Justicia tom\u00c3\u00b3 la medida altamente inusual de anunciar acusaciones formales contra cinco oficiales militares chinos acusados de efectuar un amplio ciberespionaje contra importantes empresas estadounidenses. Pero meses despu\u00c3\u00a9s, ninguno de esos demandados ha sido enjuiciado en Estados Unidos, lo que muestra el desaf\u00c3\u00ado que implica usar el sistema de justicia penal estadounidense contra piratas cibern\u00c3\u00a9ticos que operan en pa\u00c3\u00adses extranjeros.\n\nJonathan Zittrain, profesor de derecho y estudios de c\u00c3\u00b3mputo en la Universidad de Harvard, dijo que sin duda Sony enfrenta ira de los afectados por la violaci\u00c3\u00b3n a sus sistemas cibern\u00c3\u00a9ticos y la consecuente revelaci\u00c3\u00b3n de miles de documentos delicados.\n\nPero el estudio cinematogr\u00c3\u00a1fico podr\u00c3\u00ada lograr mitigar esa reacci\u00c3\u00b3n y sus posibles implicaciones legales si se determina que Corea del Norte estuvo detr\u00c3\u00a1s del ataque.\n\n\"Si Sony logra calificar esto como una interferencia directa por o a solicitud de una naci\u00c3\u00b3n-estado, \u00c2\u00bfpodr\u00c3\u00ada eso de alguna manera granjearle el tipo de inmunidad a las consecuencias que uno podr\u00c3\u00ada ver a otras compa\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00adas recibir cuando hay terrorismo f\u00c3\u00adsico involucrado, patrocinado por un estado?\", se pregunt\u00c3\u00b3 Zittrain.",
