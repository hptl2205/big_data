The nation is trying to cut down on its vehicular mayhem, but it's doing so in a deplorable but increasingly typical way: penalizing transgender people and other individuals deemed to have \"sexual disorders.\"\n\nNumerous news outlets report that a new Russian legal amendment which became public in recent days that bans \"fetishists, voyeurs, exhibitionists and transvestites\" from driving.\n\nThe Guardian reports the new law is part of an attempt to dial back Russia's catastrophic rate of crashes and road fatalities, which are among the worst in the world. Some 30,000 people die and 250,000 are injured in crashes there annually. As such, they claim to be tightening medical restrictions for drivers to limit who's on the road.\n\nThe restrictions on who can qualify for a driver's license include a long list of mental and physical disabilities, but then they veer into sexuality, gender identity and sexual behavior. (It also bans kleptomaniacs and compulsive gamblers from driving, too.) From the Guardian:\n\nBut the most controversial section is the list of sexual preferences and conditions given, including paedophilia, sado-masochism and exhibitionism, as well as \"fetishism\", which is described as people who gain sexual arousal from inanimate objects. Transsexuals and transvestites are also on the list, which is drawn from the World Health Organisation's list of \"gender identity disorders\" and \"disorders of sexual preference.\"\n\nThe law doesn't describe how a person's gender identity or sexual preference might impair their driving. (Because it doesn't, obviously.)\n\nNot surprisingly, the move was condemned by gay activists, human rights groups and lawyers in and outside of Russia. From an AP report:\n\n\"The new Russian rules banning people from driving because of their gender identity are ridiculous and unlawful,\" Nils Muiznieks, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, said in a message posted Friday on Facebook. He urged Russia \"to immediately amend the rules to remove this ban.\"\n\nAnd here's one from the U.S.-based Human Rights First:\n\n\"Banning people from driving based on their gender identity or expression is ridiculous and just another example of the Russian regime's methodical rollback of basic human rights for its citizens,\" said Human Rights First's Shawn Gaylord. \"Beyond the denial of basic freedoms, this provision may deter transgender people from seeking mental health services for fear of receiving a diagnosis that would strip them of their right to drive, and leaves the door open for increased harassment, persecution, and discrimination of transgender people by Russian authorities. We urge the United States to immediately condemn this provision and to press the Russian government to repeal this decision.\"\n\nThe list of international people who are furious at the move goes on and on. And why wouldn't they be? It seems to be yet another action in a long series of many seemingly designed to make life as miserable as possible in Russia for anyone who isn't cisgender, heterosexual, or able-bodied.",

For in Russia, transsexualism and transgenderism are now listed along with fetishism and voyeurism as examples of \"mental disorders\" that can make someone \"unfit\" to drive.\n\nThe new road safety rules, signed by the Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, have been published on the government's official website. The government says the number of road accidents in the country justifies tightening medical controls on drivers, but fails to show how sexual orientation is connected to driving ability.\n\n\"Psychiatric disorders\" including schizophrenia and drug addiction are also included in the new ban, prompting medical experts to warn that those suffering from mental health issues may be discouraged from seeking help for fear of being banned from driving.\n\nHuman rights and gay rights activists were swift to condemn the legislation. The Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights called it \"discriminatory\".\n\nA statement on the group's website said the decision would \"cause serious violations of human rights\" and demonstrated \"prejudice against groups of citizens\".\n\nIt said: \"The decision demonstrates the invasion of the privacy of each person who plans to drive a vehicle... The resolution discriminates [against] individuals and groups of citizens [which] obviously contradicts the international legal norms and standards and the Constitution of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThe organisation suggested the new law would lead to a \"new growth in corruption\" and said it would present its complaints to the Presidential Council on Human Rights, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and international organisations.\n\nTranssexualism and transgenderism are now listed examples of \"mental disorders\" that can make someone \"unfit\" to drive (Getyty Images)\n\nMr Medvedev's decision will do little to improve Russia's poor record on LGBT rights. Despite the relaxation of some anti-gay laws after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian government has continued to pass restrictive laws such as the curbs on Gay Pride parades.\n\nIn 2013, the controversial \"gay propaganda\" law banning the \"promotion of non-traditional sexual relations\" was passed, enforcing fines of up to 5,000 roubles (\u00a353) for anyone caught \"propagandising\" homosexuality to anyone aged 18 or under. Its implementation a year before Sochi Winter Olympics of 2014 led to widespread calls from LGBT-rights activists and world leaders for the games to be boycotted.\n\nThe editor of PinkNews, Joseph Patrick McCormick, said: \"It is clear from this move by the Russian government that regulations are being exploited in an effort to crack down on minority groups. It is unclear what being transgender has to do with a person's ability to drive, so banning trans people from driving seems a bizarre and irrational move.\"\n\nBut the head of the Russian Professional Drivers Union, Alexander Kotov, defended the government's decision. He said: \"We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified.\" However, he added that only professional drivers should be subject to such strict rules.\n\nThe law makes reference to \"personality and behavioural disorders\" listed in the World Health's Organisation's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Under the WHO categorisations, people with gambling addictions could potentially also be prevented from driving.\n\nA WHO spokesman said: \"The issue of whether to move the 'transsexualism' category from the ICD chapter on mental and behavioural disorders is being examined as part of the ongoing process.\"",

Although most of the provisions refer to physical impairments, such as blindness, \"gender identity disorders\" including transsexualism and dual-role transvestism are referenced in the revised provisions. Sadomasochism and exhibitionism are included as well according to BuzzFeed's J. Lester Feder and Susie Armitage.\n\nHuman rights activists and organizations, including the Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights, are justly outraged, calling the new law \"discriminatory.\" The Association of Russian Lawyers is demanding clarifications from the Russian Constitutional Court and seeking support from international human rights organizations in the process. Shawn Gaylord of Human Rights First calls the banning of people driving based on gender identity ridiculous.\n\nSaid Gaylord:\n\n\"Beyond the denial of basic freedoms, this provision may deter transgender people from seeking mental health services for fear of receiving a diagnosis that would strip them of their right to drive, and leaves the door open for increased harassment, persecution, and discrimination of transgender people by Russian authorities.\n\n\"We urge the United States to immediately condemn this provision and to press the Russian government to repeal this decision.\"\n\nRussian psychiatric experts Mikhail Strakhov and Valery Evtushenko of the Russian Psychiatric Association also condemned the regulations. However, the Professional Drivers Union supported the move, including union head Alexander Kotov. \"We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified,\" said Kotov.\n\nThe driving regulations is just one more contribution to creating a hostile, oppressive environment for LGBT Russians and it's clearly working. Since Russia passed it's anti-gay \"propaganda,\" law in June 2013, hate crimes against LGBT people in Russia have dramatically increased.",

The government of Russia is apparently made up its mind about a rather unusual way of ensuring road safety. According to a new legal amendment, people affected by any 'sexual disorders' will not be allowed to drive cars. It will 'reportedly' not issue driver licenses to homosexuals or transgenders. Not only that, according to BBC News, the new guidelines further includes things like fetishism, voyeurism and exhibitionism as grounds for not being allowed to drive.\n\nWe are only getting started about it; the ban will also include people shorter than 4 foot, 11 inches, amputees, pathological gamblers and compulsive thieves. The Russian government claims the ban intends to rein in accidents and enhance road safety. While the physical and mental disabilities can still be taken into consideration, the order doesn't explain how a person's sexual preference decides their ability to drive.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Russian Prime Minister, signed the order on December 29, 2014 and has been subjected to criticism by not only Russian, but also human rights groups from across the globe. Well, I do suppose they had that coming.\n\nRussia has recorded some of the worst figures for road accidents and fatalities, and the new regulations are part of a government programmed aimed at controlling the situation. According to official figures, around 30,000 people die and 2,50,000 get injured ever year in Russia.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time that Russia has passed a law against homosexuals or people with different sexual preferences. A Russian law that bans the 'propaganda of homosexuality' to minors, also faced international criticism.",

There are numerous straight-forward reports on the web about it (see one on the New York Daily News site), though after reading several objective mainstream pieces, I found a good opinion piece by Paris Lees on the Telegraph site (see link at beginning of this post).\n\nOK, so by now you have finished laughing at the news and are probably shaking your head in -- what's the right word? -- say, disgust. Maybe thinking something like: \"Well, Russia has made a fool of itself again.\"\n\nSo, what is the reported, i.e. mainstream, logic behind Russia's decision? Well, according to numerous sources, the country is seeking to curb the high rate of accidents on the roads by barring people with mental or developmental health problems from driving, in short, for medical reasons. That includes compulsive gamblers, apparently, and I suppose there is some logic to that: I mean, a gambler could confuse the stick shift on his or her car for the lever on a one-armed casino bandit, no? (lol) But trans people? I dunno. Maybe authorities fear they will think a traffic light stop is a good time to touch up their makeup -- because, lord knows, no sane woman would ever do that in Russia, eh. (But I digress.)\n\nAs you might expect, not everybody thinks Russia's motivation for including trans people in its bill is about keeping the roads safe. Some feel authorities are further restricting the rights of LGBTQ people because, well, they are just plain old bigots who -- to quote a Kinks' song -- feel \"their own sweat smells the best\" and everybody should be just like them.\n\nSays Shawn Gaylord, an advocacy counsel for Human Rights First, in the Daily News article: \"Banning people from driving based on their gender identity or expression is ridiculous and just another example of the Russian regime's methodical rollback of basic human rights for its citizen.\"\n\nAnd an ABC News article adds this: Human Rights First activist Shawn Gaylord said in a statement that the rule change \"leaves the door open for increased harassment, persecution and discrimination of transgender people by Russian authorities.\" He also said it could deter transgender people from seeking mental health services for fear of receiving a diagnosis that would strip them of their right to drive.\n\nIt all further reduces the credibility of Russia, which is coming across to the rest of the world as some sort of warped comic-book kingdom run by uneducated buffoons -- so very, very far removed from the real world. If officials there honestly think people are a hazard on the roads because they are transgendered, then it shows how out of touch they are with modern health issues and their treatment. If, on the other hand, it is \"plain old discrimination,\" well, what more do I need to say?\n\nWe've seen where bigotry leads this past week in Paris, and we're seeing it in Iraq and Syria and so many other countries. And it's no laughing matter. It's the road to hell.\n\nTurning the Page is an opinion blog focusing on human-rights issues faced by LGBTQ people around the world.",

RIR presents a guide to soccer stars who are romantically involved with women with Russian roots.\n\nAri, 29, a Brazilian forward with FC Krasnodar, will be marrying his Russian girlfriend Yekaterina at the end of the month. Right after the wedding, Ari intends to apply for Russian citizenship, which will qualify him to play for the Russian national team.\n\nThe Brazilian footballer has been living in Russia since February 2010 and has established himself as one of the best forwards in the Russian Premier League. Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko has said the ministry is ready to support Ari's naturalization if the request comes from the head coach of the Russian national team, Italy's Fabio Capello.\n\nThis will be a second marriage for Ari, who already has a son and a daughter with his first wife. Little is known about his Russian fianc\u00e9e: She is 24 years old and graduated from Kuban State University in Krasnodar. They met via a social network in September 2013.\n\nChristian Noboa and Olga. Source: Personal archive\n\nAri is not the first soccer player to marry a Russian. In 2008, vice-captain of FC Dynamo Moscow and Ecuadorian international Christian Noboa exchanged rings with Olga Romanova. Noboa, who was playing for FC Rubin Kazan at the time, attributes his sporting successes to his love for the Russian beauty. The couple met in a Kazan caf\u00e9 and for a long time were unable to communicate, as Christian spoke only Spanish, while Olga spoke Russian and a little bit of English. However, ultimately the language barrier did not pose a problem for them.\n\nOlga and Christian have two sons together. The Ecuadorian footballer has learnt Russian and plans to stay in Russia after he retires from his sporting career. Noboa says that the day his first son was born is the happiest day of his life.\n\nIn 2012, Russian club FC Rostov was unexpectedly joined by a player from the French national team who formerly plied his trade as a forward for Liverpool, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and Sporting Lisbon, Florent Sinama Pongolle. The Frenchman was greatly assisted in his efforts to adapt to life in the Russian provinces by his Russian wife, Anastasia, who he met at a Spanish resort in 2007.\n\nTo give him credit, Pongolle was never afraid of the severity of the Russian climate and has even been to his wife's native city of Khabarovsk, in the Russian Far East. Pongolle and Anastasia are now living in Chicago, where the footballer plays for the U.S. Major League Soccer club Chicago Fire.\n\nSpanish footballer Albert Riera had his wedding in the Siberian city of Omsk, the birthplace of his wife Yulia Korolyova. In 2008, the couple had a daughter called Alexandra.\n\nRiera and Yulia met in 2001, when Yulia, who was 23 at the time, was vacationing on Albert's native island of Mallorca. At the time, Albert was quite an ordinary second division footballer playing for a local club. \"I was on holiday after the season was over,\" says Riera, recalling how the couple met. \"In the evening, I went to a disco and saw Yulia there. We looked at each other and I realized that it was the girl I had been looking for. She was extraordinarily beautiful! We have been together since,\" he says.\n\nFC Lokomotiv Moscow's Slovak defender has learnt Russian thanks to his relationship with Russian actress Maria Gorban. The celebrity couple have been through everything together: an unexpected encounter, a separation when \u010eurica left to play in Germany, and the joy of his return to Russia. They married in March 2012.\n\n\u010eurica and Gorban were described as the most beautiful couple in Russian sport, yet they separated just six months after the wedding. However, they remain friends. Gorban is now expecting a baby with another man.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo and Irina Shayk during the Basketball Euroleague Top 16 group round match between Real Madrid and CSKA. Source: Mikhail Serbin / RIA Novosti\n\nWorld-famous football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and his girlfriend, the Russian model Irina Shayk (real name Shaykhlismanova), are one of the best-known couples in the world. Ronaldo is the most popular athlete on social networks, with over 30 million people following his Twitter account. Irina's Instagram account has 2.3 million followers.\n\nFrom the very start, their life together has been plagued by rumor, gossip, and harassment from paparazzi. The conspicuous absence of a wedding has only spurred further speculation about their possible breakup. However, the couple continue to go out together and can often be seen at Real Madrid's Euroleague Basketball home games.\n\nGianluigi Buffon, the most expensive goalkeeper in the history of football (in 2001, Juventus paid a record-breaking 52 million euros to sign him from Parma), is married to a Czech model of Russian origin, Alena \u0160eredov\u00e1, first runner-up in the Miss Czech Republic competition in 1998. They married after three years of dating, having made a bet that they would tie the knot if Buffon won a World Cup, which he did in 2006. The couple have two children.",

Las cr\u00edticas de los defensores de los derechos de los homosexuales no tardaron en llegar.\n\nLa ley, que entr\u00f3 en vigencia esta semana, proh\u00edbe conducir a cualquier persona afectada por \"problemas mentales y de comportamiento\", entre los cuales figuran aquellos que tienen que ver con \"la identidad de g\u00e9nero y las preferencias sexuales\". De esa forma, la lista incluye a los travestis y a los transexuales y tambi\u00e9n a los fetichistas, los ped\u00f3filos, los exhibicionistas, los voyeurs y los sadomasoquistas.\n\nLos defensores de derechos humanos la critican severamente. \"No entiendo por qu\u00e9 los fetichistas, pero tambi\u00e9n los clept\u00f3manos y los transexuales no pueden conducir un autom\u00f3vil\", opin\u00f3 en su blog Elena Masiouk, integrante del Consejo de Derechos Humanos ante el Kremlin. \"Es una violaci\u00f3n de los derechos de los ciudadanos rusos\", denunci\u00f3.\n\nLa asociaci\u00f3n de abogados de Rusia por los derechos humanos consider\u00f3 que la ley \"muestra la invasi\u00f3n progresiva de las autoridades en la vida privada\". La ley \"contradice de forma flagrante las leyes internacionales y rusas\", indic\u00f3 la asociaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn Rusia la homosexualidad fue considerada un crimen hasta 1993 y una enfermedad mental hasta 1999. En 2013, el Parlamento adopt\u00f3 una ley que castiga con multas y a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel cualquier tipo de \"propaganda\" homosexual ante menores. (Fuente: Clar\u00edn)",
