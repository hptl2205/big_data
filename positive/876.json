He and a number of other injured passengers filed a lawsuit on Friday (11th July) against Walmart, claiming the company should have known their truck driver, who hit the vehicle the actor and co. were travelling in, was extremely fatigued.\n Tracy Morgan and the several people injured in the collision which led to the death of comedian James McNair at the beginning of June have filed a lawsuit against Walmart.\n Tracy Morgan has filed a lawsuit against Walmart.\n Read More: Tracy Morgan Transferred To Rehab Centre, Where He'll Stay For A Few Weeks.\n Morgan, best known for his role as Tracy Jordan on 30 Rock, was severely injured and hospitalised when a Walmart lorry hit the back of the limousine in which he was travelling on 7th June.  Morgan was returning from a gig in Delaware when he was involved in a multicar pile up.  Morgan was immediately rushed to hospital along with several others involved in the crash including Morgan's assistant Jeffrey Millea, comedians Ardie Fuqua Jr. and Harris Stanton.  James McNair, AKA Jimmy Mack, was also travelling with Morgan but tragically lost his life as a result of the accident.\n The driver of the Walmart lorry, Kevin Roper, was arrested soon after the incident and charged with one count of death by auto and four counts of assault by auto.  Roper, from Jonesboro, Georgia, pleaded not guilty.  It is believed Roper fell asleep at the wheel after he had been awake for more than 24 consecutive hours.\n Morgan was hospitalised for a number of weeks, leaving Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey on 20th June.  He was moved to a rehabilitation centre from which he was released on Saturday (6th July).  Morgan has wasted no time in filing a lawsuit against Walmart on behalf of himself, Millea and Fuqua.  Millea's wife, Krista Millea, is also listed as a plaintiff.\n Tracy Morgan spent more than a month is hospital and rehab following the incident.\n The suit claims Walmart was responsible for the collision as the company should have been aware of Roper's fatigue and the long commute he faced before beginning his shift.  Roper apparently had to drive more than 700 miles (approximately 11 hours driving time) to reach the depot in Delaware where he was due to begin his shift.  As THR reports, Walmart should have employed Roper at a closer depot to his home in Georgia than the one in Delaware.  The suit further claims Walmart frequently ignores the regulations set out by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regarding shift limits.\n Morgan and the other plaintiffs are filing for the suit to be tried by a jury and are seeking compensatory, statutory and punitive damages and legal fees, among other things.  Krista Millea, who was eight months pregnant at the time of the accident, is also filing for loss of consortium.\n Walmart has responded to the lawsuit, apologising for the suffering of Morgan and the other plaintiffs and for the loss of McNair.  In a statement, Walmart described the incident as a \"terrible tragedy\" and wished the plaintiffs full recoveries.  The company also said \"We are deeply sorry that one of our trucks was involved.  As we've said, we're cooperating fully in the ongoing investigation.  We know it will take some time to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident, but we're committed to doing the right thing for all involved.\" \"\nRead More: New Jersey Turnpike Crash, Which Killed James McNair & Injured Tracy Morgan, Puts Lax Trucking Regulations Front & Centre.\n Tracy Morgan with his partner Megan Wollover.",

                    "body": "Comedian and actor Tracy Morgan is suing Walmart Stores Inc. for negligence, claiming the company contributed to a deadly crash he was in last month.  A driver of one of Walmart's trucks slammed into Morgan's limousine van and fellow comedian James McNair was killed, others were injured, and Morgan was left in critical condition.  The accident occurred on the New Jersey Turnpike June 7.\n Filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey, the suit alleges that Wal-Mart should have known - or knew - that its truck driver, Kevin Roper, had not slept at least 24 hours before the crash and was not compliant with shift limit regulations set by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  The complaint further alleges that Roper's 700 mile commute from his home in Jonesboro, Georgia to a Walmart facility in Smyrna, Delaware was \"unreasonable\" and that he fell asleep behind the wheel, causing the accident.  A separate criminal complaint accuses Roper, 35, of violating New Jersey law by not sleeping more than 24 hours before the crash.\n Other plaintiffs are limo passengers Jeffrey and Krista Millea and comedian Ardley Fuqua.  Jeffrey Millea is Morgan's assistant.  They are all seeking trial by jury with punitive damages, statutory and compensatory damages, legal fees, and pre- and post-judgment interest.\n A report from the National Transportation Safety Board said that, just before the accident, Roper was moving 65 mph in a 45-mph zone.  The speed limit along that area of the turnpike is normally 55 mph but had been lowered to 45 mph that evening due to construction.\n The wreck took the life of 62-year-old comic James \"Uncle Jimmy Mack\" McNair of Peekskill, New York.  McNair was a friend and mentor to Tracy Morgan and an active volunteer in Peekskill.  Jimmy Mack and Tracy Morgan met 20 years ago and remained close.\n Roper pleaded not guilty last month after being charged with vehicular homicide and assault-by-auto charges.  Morgan and his entourage were driving from a comedy performance at Delaware's Dover Downs Hotel & Casino when, near Cranbury, New Jersey, prosecutors said he rear-ended Morgan's van.\n Tracy Morgan, a star of television's 30 Rock and formerly of Saturday Night Live, is suing Walmart over the deadly crash after enduring broken ribs and a broken leg.  Mr. Fuqua is also in recovery.  Morgan was transferred to a rehabilitation center June 20, after two weeks at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n Tracy Morgan's lawsuit says that he endured painful and severe injuries, including multiple surgeries that were required by multiple fractures.  He has required - and will continue to require - extensive treatment and significant physical rehabilitation.\n A statement issued by Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart said the company is \"committed to doing the right thing for all involved,\" and expressed sorrow over the accident and the death of McNair and all injured.  \"We are deeply sorry that one of our trucks was involved.\" \" The company reported its full co\u00f6peration with the ongoing federal investigation.",

He thanked everyone for their support after last month's crash on the New Jersey Turnpike, which killed one of his mentors.\n The former 30 Rock actor walked gingerly out of his home, using a walker.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Morgan smiled and gave the V-sign to the photographers, who then applauded him as he got into his car.\n \"It's OK,\" he told them as he rolled down the window to speak.  \"I love you very much.  Thank you.  I appreciate everything,\" he added as he was driven away.\n A rep for the comedian said Sunday that Morgan left a rehabilitation center, but will still undergo outpatient treatment.  He suffered several injuries from the accident, including a broken leg and broken ribs.\n \"He asked me to pass along his sincerest gratitude to everyone who has helped him get to this point.  He would also appreciate some privacy during this crucial point in his recovery,\" the rep's statement read in part.\n Also over the weekend, it was reported that Morgan and three other victims of the crash filed a lawsuit against Walmart, the owner of the truck Kevin Roper was driving on June 7.  Roper is also facing charges in connection with the crash and prosecutors allege that he had not slept in 24 hours before taking the wheel.\n One passenger in Morgan's limo, comedian James McNair, died in the crash.",

According to the New York Daily News, Sunday morning Tracy was released from the rehab facility he's been staying at and will now continue his recovery at home.\n Two weeks after the initial crash (where a Wal-Mart truck collided with Tracy's limo on the New Jersey turnpike after a comedy gig), Tracy was released from the hospital and into the inpatient rehab center once his post-crash condition had improved.  Now, three weeks later, he's finally reached the next milestone in his recovery.\n Of course, Tracy's not just resting at his Cresskill, New Jersey home -- he's still got a long road ahead of him as he continues with an outpatient treatment program.  Fortunately, though, he'll be able to go home to his family after therapy this time.\n \"He's doing good,\" Tracy's oldest son, Tracy Jr., said.  \"He's just resting.\" \"\nLast week, the 45-year-old former 30 Rock star -- along with James McNair's wife, and limo passengers Jeffrey Millea and Ardie Fuqua -- filed a lawsuit accusing Wal-Mart of negligence, saying the company should've known driver Kevin Roper was breaking their regulations on shift limits.  Tracy and the other plantiffs are seeking \"compensatory and statutory damages, punitive damages, legal fees, as well as pre- and post judgment interest, among other things at a trial by jury.\" \"\nAlthough it definitely sounds like it's going to be a long one, we wish Tracy a successful recovery.

Scott DesJarlais over his personal history with abortion, posting a new web page and sending out a mailer to voters just before the start of early voting.\n Tracy, R-Shelbyville, says the incumbent congressman has been ineffective because his reputation has been damaged by disclosures contained in divorce filings released two years ago.  Those disclosures -- the full details of which did not become public until after DesJarlais had been re-elected -- include statements that he supported two abortions by his former wife prior to their marriage and had affairs with patients before the divorce was finalized in 2001.\n \"Too many Republicans in Washington have been ineffective at fighting the Obama agenda because they've lacked the personal credibility,\" Tracy said through a spokeswoman.  \"We need a representative in Washington who is both conservative and effective.  This time voters have a choice in the Republican primary, last time they didn't.\" \"\nDesJarlais, R-South Pittsburg, has acknowledged the problems in his past but says he should be judged by his behavior in the 13 years since then and by his current marriage.\n \"Clearly these actions by Senator Tracy show his campaign is in panic mode over their poll numbers and feel their only option is to launch a desperate and disgusting campaign based on the same gutter politics Tennesseans rejected during the last two elections,\" said Robert Jameson, a spokesman for the campaign.  \"While Senator Tracy likes to talk about the importance of integrity, it seems his campaign has little of it.\" \"\nThe moves demonstrate the Republican primary in the 4th Congressional district has taken a negative turn just before Tennesseans start going to the polls for early voting on Friday.\n Until now, Tracy has avoided bringing up DesJarlais' past explicitly.  In a recent television ad, he perhaps made a subtle nod to the issue, with Tracy saying too many congressmen lack integrity, a line that his campaign echoed to explain the latest tactic.\n Even the most recent attacks on DesJarlais have been relatively low-key.  The Tracy campaign's page on DesJarlais is accessible only by direct link, while his mailer has not yet been accompanied with a new television ad.\n DesJarlais also appears to be taking swings at Tracy.  His campaign has set up a website that claims Tracy has sided with President Barack Obama on taxes, Common Core and the economic stimulus.",

Scott DesJarlais in the 4th Congressional District's Republican primary on Aug. 7.\n In a direct mail piece last week, the Shelbyville state senator's campaign questions DesJarlais' effectiveness and charges he has \"no moral ground to stand on,\" given his personal history, to \"stand up to\" President Barack Obama and \"liberal Democrats.\" \"\nThe mailer refers to revelations during and after the 2012 campaign that DesJarlais, a South Pittsburg physician who calls himself strongly pro-life, advocated for his ex-wife and a patient with whom he'd had an affair to have abortions.\n \"Stand up to Obama and a Liberal Washington?\" the direct mail piece asks.  \"Obama's liberal agenda is destroying America.  We need strong, conservative leadership to defend our values.  But Scott DesJarlais doesn't have the moral ground to stand on.\" \"\nThe front of the mailer depicts wooden toy letter blocks spelling \"baby,\" and goes on to say, \"Abortions.  Affairs.  Abuse of Power.  We can't trust DesJarlais to Fight for Our Values.\" \"\nDesJarlais spokesman Robert Jameson called the piece \"just the sort of disgusting gutter politics we'd expected from [U.S. House Democratic leader] Nancy Pelosi and her allies in Washington.\" \"\n\"It's terribly disappointing that Sen.  Tracy chose to go this route rather than have a meaningful discussion on the issues,\" Jameson said.  \"He's chosen to engage in these same sort of gutter politics that Tennesseans have rejected in the last two elections.\" \"\nThe mailer appears to have gone out prior to DesJarlais' announcement Friday that he has been diagnosed with cancer in his neck and will undergo chemotherapy and radiation starting this week.  The congressman said it was caught early and doctors believe he has a 90 percent chance of recovery.\n Tracy launched a similar attack on his campaign website, www.tracyfortn.com/truth-about-desjarlais: \"DesJarlais says he shares our Conservative values but ...  He supported two abortions prior to the marriage of his wife, [g]ot fines for ethics violations during his time as a physician, [a]nd that isn't even half of the story!\"\nIn records from his 2000 divorce, DesJarlais acknowledged going along with his then-wife's decision to obtain two abortions.  Last year, the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners voted 8-0 to reprimand DesJarlais and fined him $500 for sexual relationships with two patients in 2000.\n Following his 2012 re-election, DesJarlais said in a radio interview that all this occurred more than a decade earlier, before his successful re-marriage.  He is not that same person, the congressman said.\n \"I know God's forgiven me.  ...  I simply ask my fellow Christians and constituents to consider doing the same for me,\" he said.\n Tracy told the Times Free Press on Thursday during a campaign stop in Cleveland, Tenn., said the issue comes down to who effective representation for the 4th District.\n \"It gives people a choice between me and him.  Who do the people think would be the most effective?  And in being the most effective, you take everything into consideration,\" Tracy said.\n \"I definitely think it's legitimate,\" he added.\n When he announced in January 2013 that he try to stop DesJarlais's bid for a third term, Tracy charged the incumbent had \"betrayed and deceived\" voters about his past.\n He said, \"I promise that I will never embarrass you with my personal conduct or compromise on my conservative principles.\" \"\nBut until now, Tracy has campaigned on his conservative credentials and used softer terms like \"integrity\" in an ad without referencing the scandals.\n With early voting starting Friday, there's speculation the approach hasn't worked as well as the Tracy campaign had hoped.  Both sides claim their polling puts them ahead.\n A number of tea party groups continue to support DesJarlais.  Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips said last week that \"we need more conservatives who will stick to their principles and we need more Congressmen like Scott Desjarlais.\" \"\nTracy, meanwhile, has the support of most of his Senate Republican colleagues and has raised far more money than the incumbent.  Tracy has been up on television while DesJarlais has not.  His endorsements include groups like Concerned Women Political Action Committee.",

Shields, mom Tracey Shields, brother Peyton Shields and baby brother Nash Shields\nMarch 12, 2007 was the most terrifying day of Tracy Shields' life.  Tracy, who lives in Waveland, Mississippi, took her newborn daughter Lily to the doctor for her two week check-up where the doctor discovered an abnormal heart rhythm.  After an EKG confirmed a problem, the doctor sent Tracy and Lily to the emergency room right away.  Tracy was in a state of panic.\n Once Tracy and Lily arrived at the hospital, a Pediatric Cardiologist was waiting for them.  He hooked Lily up to a monitor and explained that Lily had Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT), a heart condition where the heart's electrical system doesn't work right, causing the heart to beat very fast.\n In order to get Lily's heart into a normal rhythm doctors put a Ziploc bag of ice on her face and shocked her back into a normal rhythm.\n \"Watching your baby scream while they held a bag of ice on her face was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do,\" said Tracy.  \"From the ER, we were brought up to the PICU, where we lived for the next two weeks.\" \"\nDoctors finally got Lily's heart into a normal rhythm that was controlled by medication for the first year of her life.  When Lily was 13 months old she was able stop taking the medications.  She had thankfully outgrown the SVT.  She is still checked yearly, but is now a healthy, active 7-year-old.\n Lily's heart defect, as well as those of countless other Mississippi newborns, could most likely have been detected right after birth, had she been given a pulse oximetry screening.\n The American Heart Association is working to have pulse oximetry screening added to the Newborn Screening Panel for all babies born in Mississippi.  This would require pulse oximetry screening of all newborns for congenital heart defects.  Congenital heart defects are the number one killer of infants with birth defects.\n \"Pulse oximetry saves lives,\" said Dr. Mary Taylor, co-director of the Children's Heart Center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.  \"The non-invasive screening can effectively identify infants with signs of congenital heart defects, saving valuable time and helping determine what the next course of testing and treatment should be.\" \"",
