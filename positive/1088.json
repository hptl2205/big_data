Many of the slum dwellers blamed the police for the man's death, and the ensuing confrontation between residents and police officers engulfed the hillside slum and spilled down into the high-rent Copacabana neighborhood.  Firefights rang out, and police detonated deafening stun grenades sprayed clouds of tear gas as residents hurled glass bottles and other projectiles.  Another man was killed in the mayhem, apparently by a bullet to the head.\n A woman shouts at police officers as residents of Pavao-Pavaozinho slum clash with riot police during a protest against the death of Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira after his burial in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, April 24, 2014.  The protest followed the burial of Douglas Pereira, whose shooting death sparked clashes Tuesday night between police and residents of the Pavao-Pavaozinho slum.  (AP Photo/Felipe Dana)\nSandwiched between two of Rio's most touristy and priciest neighborhoods, Pavao-Pavaozinho is also near the site of FIFA's Fan Fest, an outdoor screening area on Copacabana beach that will allow non-ticket holders to follow the World Cup matches.\n While he called the incident \"sad,\" Valcke suggested the media had exaggerated Tuesday's violence.  He compared the coverage to news reports about riots a few years ago in the poor suburbs of Paris that made the situation there seem like a war.\n \"There is not a single country where there are not problems on the day to day,\" Valcke said, adding that if people are worried about violence during the Brazil World Cup, they should also be worried about possible problems in Russia, which is hosting the 2018 tournament.\n Violence flared during a World Cup warm-up tournament in Brazil last year, after the largest public protests in a generation broke out at the start of the tournament.  In the six host cities, protests took place during most of the matches, with police firing stun grenades and clouds of tear gas as some of the demonstrators hurled Molotov cocktails.  The clouds of tear gas were so thick outside the final at Rio's Maracana stadium that players complained it affected them on the pitch.\n Brazil has more cities on the list of the world's 50 most dangerous metropolises than any other, with 16 entries, according to the Mexico-based Citizen Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice.

Many of the slum dwellers blamed the police for the man's death, and the ensuing confrontation between residents and police officers engulfed the hillside slum and spilled down into the high-rent Copacabana neighborhood.  Firefights rang out, and police detonated deafening stun grenades sprayed clouds of tear gas as residents hurled glass bottles and other projectiles.  Another man was killed in the mayhem, apparently by a bullet to the head.\n Sandwiched between two of Rio's most touristy and priciest neighborhoods, Pavao-Pavaozinho is also near the site of FIFA's Fan Fest, an outdoor screening area on Copacabana beach that will allow non-ticket holders to follow the World Cup matches.\n While he called the incident \"sad,\" Valcke suggested the media had exaggerated Tuesday's violence.  He compared the coverage to news reports about riots a few years ago in the poor suburbs of Paris that made the situation there seem like a war.\n \"There is not a single country where there are not problems on the day to day,\" Valcke said, adding that if people are worried about violence during the Brazil World Cup, they should also be worried about possible problems in Russia, which is hosting the 2018 tournament.\n Violence flared during a World Cup warm-up tournament in Brazil last year, after the largest public protests in a generation broke out at the start of the tournament.  In the six host cities, protests took place during most of the matches, with police firing stun grenades and clouds of tear gas as some of the demonstrators hurled Molotov cocktails.  The clouds of tear gas were so thick outside the final at Rio's Maracana stadium that players complained it affected them on the pitch.\n Brazil has more cities on the list of the world's 50 most dangerous metropolises than any other, with 16 entries, according to the Mexico-based Citizen Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice.  Mexico comes in second place, with 9 cities on the 2014 list, which was released in January.",

                    "body": "For Dembore Silva, this year's World Cup in Brazil means a new motorcycle.  That's what the 26-year-old plans to buy with the proceeds from renting out his studio apartment in Brazil's biggest slum for the month-long soccer tournament, which ends on July 13.  He expects to collect 4,000 reais ($1,784) from guests willing to sample life on the wild side of Rio de Janeiro's favelas (slum neighborhoods), where federal troops in March were sent to help local police after at least five officers were killed this year and drug gangs and organized crime torched police buildings.  \"I'm going to be out of my apartment during the World Cup, but my pocket's going to be so happy,\" says Silva, who makes a living guiding tourists around Rio's slums.\n About half of the 600,000 foreign visitors expected for the World Cup will visit Rio, where many matches including the final will be played.  They'll compete for 55,400 hotel beds, with much of the remaining demand being met by people renting out their homes.  That's a potential gold mine for would-be entrepreneurs, who have listed scores of slum properties for rent on websites including Airbnb and Favela Experience, set up by Elliot Rosenberg, a 24-year-old from the U.S. with a degree in commerce and Latin American studies from the University of Virginia.\n \"The water and electricity isn't perfect,\" says one property broker in Rocinha, Rio's biggest slum, which overlooks great beaches.  \"But nowhere in Rio's perfect.\" \"\nRio's favelas are home to 1.4 million people, 22 percent of the city's population.  That's close to the number of residents of Philadelphia.  Efforts by the city's government to, as it says, \"pacify\" the hillside communities, which until the arrival of police units six years ago were controlled by heavily armed drug gangs, have emboldened property brokers to test the unlikely locale's marketability to visitors.\n Cheap rents are a lure.  A three-bedroom residence in Leblon, Rio's most exclusive neighborhood, goes for an average of 3,500 reais a day during the World Cup, according to Creci, Rio's regional real estate brokerage council.  Lodging in a favela can run less than a tenth that amount.  To get to Silva's 200-reais-a-night ($89) place in Rocinha, the largest favela with about 70,000 residents, guests have to negotiate several steep stairways before they get to the narrow alley that leads to a three-story building, where he has the top apartment.  Inside, the furniture is basic, with a double bed the centerpiece of a red- and green-walled room.  He's most proud of the roof terrace that offers views of the ocean and an area called \"Dirty Clothes,\" a Rocinha neighborhood that remains a gang stronghold.\n Even with police on patrol, the sound of gunshots still crackles occasionally through the network of steep alleys that make up the neighborhood.  Nonetheless, Silva, who has the words \"Forgive Me For My Sins\" tattooed on his neck, says Rocinha is safer for tourists than upmarket Ipanema and Leblon, where the top hotels are.\n Rosenberg, who moved to Rio from Beverly Hills, uses his website to broker deals for favela residents including Silva for a 25 percent commission.  He says the slum areas can be safer than many think.  \"I've had many guests mugged down there, but never here,\" says Rosenberg, pointing to the sweeping beaches below that grace many of the postcards visitors send back from Rio.  He lives in Rocinha, too, so he can be close to his clients.  \"The water and electricity isn't perfect,\" he says.  \"But nowhere in Rio's perfect.\" \"\nSome travelers embrace the favela charm.  \"I love Rocinha,\" says Martha Snow, a 21-year-old British student staying with a local family.  \"It's really misunderstood.  Two friends were going to come and visit but changed their minds because they didn't want to take the risk.\" \" Snow says such concerns are overblown but admits that she's always vigilant and doesn't walk in certain areas, particularly at night.\n The pacification program has spurred local investment, says Conrado Denton, a member of a group that opened the Hotel Mirante Do Arvrao in January in Vidigal, a favela next to Rocinha that's popular with tourists.  It has dormitory-style rooms on the first floor, and the second has ocean-facing double bedrooms that will cost as much as $300 a night during the World Cup.  \"We bought the space four years ago but started building after the police moved in,\" Denton says, sitting in a lobby area that overlooks a large tree that the hotel is named after.  \"It's created new opportunities.  In the past, the place where we're sitting was the worst: It was the place where all the top drug dealers lived.\" \"",

                    "body": "With the World Cup just six weeks away and the Olympics on the horizon, social dysfunction in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro is subject to increasing international scrutiny.\n Many say authorities' attempts to tackle crime in Rio's famous slums have been heavy-handed and ineffective.  But now more than ever it seems the city's residents are turning to faith to express their dissatisfaction with the police.\n It's not often you get to interview Jesus, but last week I was lucky enough to have a few words with the great man before he took off on the road to the crucifixion.\n Except on this occasion, he wasn't heading up a hill outside Jerusalem but a steep incline near the centre of Rio de Janeiro in South America's largest slum, Rocinha.\n Jesus has been doing this for the last 22 years on Good Friday.\n On this occasion, Andre Martins, a security guard at a nearby shopping mall, was playing Him for the fourth time.\n The reconstruction is called the Via Sacra and it's not difficult to see why the show's director and founder, Aurelio Mesquita, cast this startlingly charismatic 27-year-old in the lead role.\n I am surprised that his exceptionally clear diction and penetrating eyes have not earned him a role in one of Rio's television soap operas, which are sold all around the world.\n But the Via Sacra is not about stars, or about a faithful reconstruction of Christ's final journey.\n Each year Mr Mesquita selects important political and social issues to highlight in a show which, given its setting in Rocinha, cannot but shine a light on Brazil's huge levels of inequality.\n These issues are never anything less than bold.\n The traditional figures of the Passion Play have over the years been portrayed as drug dealers, corrupt policemen, prostitutes, victims of massacres and bent politicians among others, to emphasise what Mr Mesquita believes to be the contemporary relevance of Christ's personal philosophy.\n This has created problems for Mr Mesquita from the very start.\n Indeed, after the first performance in 1992 he was condemned from the pulpit of Rio's Roman Catholic Cathedral for, it was deemed, tainting the story of Christ by associating it with a favela, as the slums in Brazil are known.\n I wouldn't be surprised if some of the Catholic hierarchy were grumbling when they learned that one of this year's themes was about what Andre Martins, aka Jesus, described to me as the global scourge of paedophilia.\n But the subject that hovers every year around the performance of the Via Sacra is the vexed issue of the relationship between Rocinha's residents and the police.\n Never has this subject had a more acute political resonance than it does today, only weeks before the World Cup kicks off.\n In November 2011 Rocinha became part of an extraordinary experiment known either as Pacification or more commonly by the acronym UPP.\n This involved sending in special forces in two sprawling favela complexes the Brazilian military.  The aim was to push out the drug cartels.\n They controlled the slums as their base to sell cocaine to the wealthy middle-class children of neighbouring areas.\n Once the traffickers were forced out or arrested, police then established a heavy armed presence in the favelas to prevent their return.\n This show of state power was meant to be followed by something equally important to the residents of Rocinha - the Social UPP, which was supposed to bring more schools, health centres and social services.\n The aim was to reduce the high levels of murder and robbery associated with the drug gangs and put an end to state indifference towards the favelas.\n Amongst other aims, this was designed to reassure visitors to Rio during the World Cup and, in two years' time, to the Olympics.\n Like almost every resident of Rocinha, Mr Mesquita says there has been no sign of the Social UPP since the police moved in over two years ago.\n \"Nothing,\" he stresses bitterly, \"absolutely nothing.\" \"\nThis perceived failure has been compounded by the creeping return of some drug traffickers into the favela, and a disastrous incident last July when an innocent labourer was tortured to death by members of the UPP force.\n The officers were supposed to be trained in more community-friendly policing techniques.\n And that is why the Via Sacra, Jesus's journey to the cross, was imbued with such tension this year.\n Is the UPP coming apart at the seams just before the World Cup?  Mr Mesquita doesn't know and he has something more important on his mind - the endless task of finding funds for next year's Via Sacra.\n I hope he finds them because his remarkable project is one of the most creative uses of Christian iconography I have ever encountered.",

Por ejemplo, en una obra en torno a un estadio se puede romper una fibra \u00f3ptica.  Esto aumenta la carga organizativa\", ejemplific\u00f3 Fernandes, que subray\u00f3 que la \"integraci\u00f3n\" de todos los actores responsables por las obras han sido una \"garant\u00eda del \u00e9xito\" del torneo.\n El exfutbolista Bebeto, miembro del comit\u00e9 organizador, dijo que le sorprendi\u00f3 la cantidad de trabajo que supone la organizaci\u00f3n de un Mundial.\n \"El Mundial ya es una realidad.  Estoy ansioso por que comience ya.  El trabajo fue arduo.  Yo no ten\u00eda noci\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo era organizar el Mundial.  Como jugador, iba, hac\u00eda el gol y ganaba el partido.  He aprendido mucho, estoy muy feliz y orgulloso de ser brasile\u00f1o\", coment\u00f3 el delantero de la selecci\u00f3n campeona mundial en 1994.\n Valcke tambi\u00e9n volvi\u00f3 a comentar los problemas de seguridad en R\u00edo de Janeiro y asegur\u00f3 que \"no hay una revoluci\u00f3n\" en Brasil y \"nunca\" sinti\u00f3 que pueda suponer un problema para la organizaci\u00f3n del Mundial o para los aficionados.\n Asimismo reiter\u00f3 su confianza en las autoridades brasile\u00f1as y dijo que \"no hay pa\u00eds donde no haya problemas\" de seguridad.",
