Lucas gave the police his ID, but Watts refused to hand over hers in the belief that she'd done nothing wrong. The police subsequently handcuffed Watts. According to Lucas' account on his Facebook page, he believes the police thought Watts was a prostitute.\n\n\"It's not a crime to be fully clothed showing public affection in our car,\" Watts said in an interview with CNN Monday. \"It's my right and my pleasure to enjoy myself... I don't feel like I should be ashamed about it.\"\n\nWatts told CNN she was \"humbled by the experience\" of having her story told to the world.",

Patrol officers and a sergeant from the North Hollywood Division responded to the 11900 block of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and \"located two individuals that matched the description of the suspects, and they were briefly detained,\" police said in a statement.\n\n\"Upon further investigation it was determined that no crime had been committed,\" police said. \"Ms. Watts and her companion were subsequently released.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Watts and her companion, Brian James Lucas, voiced their complaints about the officers' conduct on their Facebook pages.\n\nWatt wrote that she was detained after \"showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.\" By the time police arrived, she said she was talking on her cellphone with her father. \"I knew that I had done nothing wrong, that I wasn't harming anyone, so I walked away,\" Watts wrote. Shortly thereafter, she said, two officers came up and put her in handcuffs.\n\nLucas, a Los Angeles chef, gave a similar account. He said officers mistreated Watts when she refused to provide them with her identification.\n\n\"I gave him my ID knowing we did nothing wrong and when they asked D for hers, she refused to give it because they had no right to do so,\" wrote Lucas, who is white. \"So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was. In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly not cool!\"\n\nLucas posted photos of the incident, including one of a cut he said Watts suffered while being detained.\n\nLAPD Capt. Stephen Carmona of the North Hollywood area station said that \"because of the allegations that were raised ... we're going to look into it.... We take all of these things really seriously, and we're going to ask the hard questions.\"\n\nNonetheless, Carmona defended the officers, saying they were doing due diligence when they detained Watts after she did not give them identification.\n\n\"That's just basic policework. It could be a vandalism suspect in an alley,\" Carmona said. \"The vandalism may be done, but they're still going to investigate the incident.\"\n\n\"We can't just say, 'OK, thanks, you guys. We're going to go now,'\" Carmona said. \"We're obligated to see who it was, so that if something comes up later, we know who we dealt with.\"\n\nWatts and Lucas did not respond to The Times' requests for comment. Watts' manager, Shepard Smith, declined to comment.\n\nWatts plays the daughter of Martin Lawrence's character on the FX television sitcom \"Partners,\" which premiered last month.

I'm just being really honest.\"\n\nThe police officer then responds \"Who brought up the race card? Why?\"\n\nIn the nearly three minute-long audio clip, Watts is heard becoming increasingly upset as the police officer continues asking for her ID, and at one point, she mentions \"I have a publicist and I work as an actor at this studio.\"\n\nThe incident occurred near the CBS Radford studios in Studio City, about 6 miles (10 km) northwest of Hollywood.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Officer Wendy Reyes said the audio appeared to be from the incident, but she could not confirm how TMZ obtained the recording.\n\nWatts is best known for her supporting role in Quentin Tarantino's 2012's slavery western film \"Django Unchained,\" and more recently starred alongside Kelsey Grammar and Martin Lawrence in FX show \"Partners.\"\n\n\"I was handcuffed and detained by 2 police officers from the Studio City Police Department after refusing to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place,\" Watts wrote on her Facebook page.\n\nWatts' representatives did not respond to calls for comment Monday, although she and Lucas appeared on CNN, where the actress defended her decision to not hand her ID to the police.",

Patrol officers and a sergeant from the North Hollywood Division responded to the 11900 block of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and \"located two individuals that matched the description of the suspects, and they were briefly detained,\" police said in a statement.\n\n\"Upon further investigation it was determined that no crime had been committed,\" police said. \"Ms. Watts and her companion were subsequently released.\"\n\nAfter the incident, Watts and her companion, Brian James Lucas, voiced their complaints about the officers' conduct on their Facebook pages.\n\nWatt wrote that she was detained after \"showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.\" By the time police arrived, she said she was talking on her cellphone with her father. \"I knew that I had done nothing wrong, that I wasn't harming anyone, so I walked away,\" Watts wrote. Shortly thereafter, she said, two officers came up and put her in handcuffs.\n\nLucas, a Los Angeles chef, gave a similar account. He said officers mistreated Watts when she refused to provide them with her identification.\n\n\"I gave him my ID knowing we did nothing wrong and when they asked D for hers, she refused to give it because they had no right to do so,\" wrote Lucas, who is white. \"So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was. In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly not cool!\"\n\nLucas posted photos of the incident, including one of a cut he said Watts suffered while being detained.\n\nLAPD Capt. Stephen Carmona of the North Hollywood area station said that \"because of the allegations that were raised ... we're going to look into it.... We take all of these things really seriously, and we're going to ask the hard questions.\"\n\nNonetheless, Carmona defended the officers, saying they were doing due diligence when they detained Watts after she did not give them identification.\n\n\"That's just basic policework. It could be a vandalism suspect in an alley,\" Carmona said. \"The vandalism may be done, but they're still going to investigate the incident.\"\n\n\"We can't just say, 'OK, thanks, you guys. We're going to go now,'\" Carmona said. \"We're obligated to see who it was, so that if something comes up later, we know who we dealt with.\"\n\nWatts and Lucas did not respond to The Times' requests for comment. Watts' manager, Shepard Smith, declined to comment.\n\nWatts plays the daughter of Martin Lawrence's character on the FX television sitcom \"Partners,\" which premiered last month. She also had a role on the final season of the Showtime TV series \"Weeds.\"\n\nThe incident comes weeks after Beverly Hills police officers handcuffed and detained Charles Belk, an African American film producer who was attending a pre-Emmy party in the city.

'How do you know her?' 'Are you together?'\"\n\nThe two have been dating for the past year and a half.\n\nThe incident in the 11900 block of Ventura Boulevard happened last Thursday in Studio City.\n\nIn cellphone video captured by her boyfriend, Watts could be seen sobbing as she pleaded with police.\n\n\"I don't have to feel ashamed for being who I am and that's really where the tears were coming from,\" Watts told CBS2/KCAL9's Art Barron on Sunday.\n\nThe LAPD said in a statement Sunday that officers responded to the location around 3:01 p.m. following a radio call of \"indecent exposure.\"\n\nThe couple learned from officers that someone at a nearby office building had called in the report. Watts had just gotten out of an interview at CBS Studios' Radford lot and was sitting in the Mercedes-Benz on her boyfriend's lap.\n\n\"The citizen who called the police to complain told the 911 operator that a male and a female were involved in indecent exposure inside a Silver Mercedes with the vehicle door open,\" the statement alleged.\n\nWhen officers arrived, police said they located two people who matched the description of the subjects.\n\n\"So, I said, 'Well, making out is not illegal,'\" Lucas said. \"And the cop was like, 'Yeah, I know, but they're being distracted.' Well, it's not really our problem that we're showing public affection, but we stopped.\"\n\n\"We stopped,\" Watts said.\n\nLucas said he gave the officers his identification when asked, but Watts refused.\n\n\"I knew that the clearest thing for me to do was to own my right as a free person and say I haven't done anything wrong and I know I'm not required to give you my ID,\" she said.\n\nWatts walked away and another officer down the street put her in handcuffs and into the back of a patrol car, according to Lucas. Once police identified Watts, Lucas says they let them go.\n\nWatts also posted an account of the incident on her Facebook account. In the 446-word post, she says, \"As I was sitting in the back of the police car, I remembered the countless times my father came home frustrated or humiliated by the cops when he had done nothing wrong.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I felt his shame, his anger, and my own feelings of frustration for existing in a world where I have allowed myself to believe that 'authority figures' could control my BEING... my ability to BE!\"\n\nCalifornia has no law requiring people to show police their identification when not driving, according to KCAL9 Legal Analyst Steve Meister. However, if the police have reasonable suspicion, they are permitted to detain an individual for a reasonable amount of time in order to ascertain the person's identity.\n\nIn this case, officers said they were responding to a radio call of indecent exposure.\n\nWatts said she has hired an attorney but has no plans at this time to file a lawsuit against the police department. She said she wanted to bring this incident to light because \"it's about bringing awareness to how we can see the humanity in each other? How can we see each other as equals?\"\n\nMeanwhile, police said an internal complaint investigation has since been initiated regarding the incident.",

Lucas wrote on Facebook, \"Our freedom isn't freedom folks, when people can abuse others with no reason or evidence.\"\n\nWatts was briefly put in cuffs after police arrived on the scene because she walked away, refusing to give any form of identification -- which is against the law in California if police have probable cause -- in this case, it seems they did. (Video via KCAL)\n\nBoth Watts and Lucas claim they were only kissing, fully clothed, when an onlooker called the police. But now there's another side to the story.\n\nTMZ reports multiple witnesses from the nearby Directors Guild office building saw the \"Django Unchained\" actress and her boyfriend having sex in broad daylight in the passenger seat of the car with the door open. Not only that, but the outlet also obtained audio from the incident.\n\nWATTS: \"Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black? Just because I'm black and he's white?\"\n\nWATTS: \"I think I'd like to identify you to my publicist.\"\n\nThere are four separate audio recordings of the incident on TMZ's site that you can check out for yourself. But let's go to a BuzzFeed article from Sunday -- Watts gave the outlet an exclusive interview.\n\nIn the article BuzzFeed does note, \"Watts, who is black, and Lucas, who is white, both said that race was playing on their minds during the incident.\" But the article went on to quote Watts as saying: \"It wasn't a black white thing, it was more about something like a hypocrisy. ... And I think these kinds of discussions can help us.\" That sounds a bit different than what Watts said in the newly released audio.\n\nSince the new developments, both Watts and Lucas went on CNN to talk about the incident. They were bluntly asked if they were having sex. Here's her answer.\n\n\"In my opinion, it's not a crime to be fully clothed showing affection on a public street. ... It's my right and my pleasure to enjoy myself.\"\n\nAlso in the interview Watts defended her decision to not give officers her ID, saying, \"I believe in America and what it stands for.\"\n\nThe couple told CNN they have contacted lawyers, the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. For the record, the ACLU does suggest that people give police identification when they respond to a call with probable cause. The LAPD has started an internal investigation as well.",

Jim Parker calmly speaking to Lucas and explaining why he was called. But Watts jumps in and instantly brings up both her race and the fact that she has a publicist.\n\nAs the confrontation escalates, Watts says she serves \"freedom and love,\" while the authorities \"serve detainment.\" She later yells:\n\n\"I hope when you're f-cking your spouses you really feel alive.\"\n\nWatts has reportedly hired an attorney and plans to file a lawsuit against the LAPD.\n\nDoes she have a case?

One image shows a cut on her wrist, which she said was caused by the tight handcuffs.\n\nWatts, who acts in the FX show \"Partners,\" said the officers \"accosted me and forced me into handcuffs\" after she refused \"to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.\"\n\nLucas said when an officer asked for their identifications, he showed his that but Watts refused \"to give it because they had no right to do so.\"\n\n\"So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was,\" he wrote. \"In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist, which was truly NOT COOL!!!\"\n\nShe was released \"quite quickly when they realized we were right outside CBS and that she was a celebrity and I was a celeb chef,\" Lucas wrote. \"Before they figured out who she was they were threatening calling an ambulance and drugging her for being psychologically unstable, SO NOT COOL WHATSOEVER! \"\n\nWatts and Lucas said they initially decided to forget about the incident, but then they decided they needed to speak up.\n\n\"We still forgive, love and bless them ... just not putting up with this for our own freedom and heart space,\" Lucas wrote.\n\nThe couple has contacted lawyers, the ACLU and the NAACP, he said. \"Our publicist has us in contact with media about it, too, and we're supposed to hear back.\"\n\nWatts, a native of Atlanta, made her feature film debut in 2012 as Coco in the Oscar-nominated \"Django Unchained.\" Her biggest television role is on \"Partners,\" in which she plays Martin Lawrence's daughter.\n\nRecommended",

Lucas said he suspects that onlookers assumed Watts to be a prostitute and him a client because she is black and he is white.\n\nLos Angeles police Lt. Andrew Neiman said citizens are required to identify themselves if requested to do so by an officer who has reasonable suspicion to believe an offense may have been committed.\n\nIn this case, he said, reasonable suspicion was created by the 911 call, and Watts and Lucas fit the description and location described by the caller.\n\nCelebrity website TMZ posted audio of the exchange between Watts and police. Neiman and Bill McCoy, a spokesman for the couple, say the audio is authentic, though its origin is unknown.\n\nOn the recording, a police sergeant is heard telling Watts, \"Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here, so it gives me the right to identify you by law.\"\n\nWatts can be heard responding in frustration. She was detained until police determined no crime was committed.\n\nNeiman said it is unlikely that a recording of the 911 call will be made public. The results of the LAPD's internal investigation of the matter, which could take several months, are also unlikely to be released, he said.\n\nWatts said the officer's demeanor was an emotional trigger for her because of personal and historical experiences of racial profiling by police.\n\n\"He was not abusive,\" she said. \"He was not overtly racist.\"\n\nShe said she felt as though she was singled out even though she hadn't done anything wrong. She said she is speaking out about the incident in hopes of furthering a discussion about \"questions that give us clarity about the nature of our being in this society.\"\n\n\"I can understand how people would say that I'm being a drama queen and that I created this situation for publicity,\" she said. \"To a certain degree, you can say they're correct in that if I'm going to be in the public eye, I'm going to stand up for what I believe in, and I don't believe I committed any crime where I deserved to be in handcuffs.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen at www.twitter.com/APSandy .\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

The video, with a similar setting as earlier beheadings of two journalists, was aimed this time at Britain because of its role in collaborating with the US in the war against ISIS. Another hostage named Alan Henning may be next. Both UK Prime Minister David Cameron and US president Barack Obama responded saying they would not back down. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry's mission to win over Arab allies to join the US-led coalition claims to have had some success. However those allies apparently cannot be named. Click here for a Newsweek article and here for a Washington Post article about the story.\n\nElsewhere in the Middle East, Egyptians are pushing back against the draconian efforts of a militaristic regime headed by former Army General Abdel Fatah Al Sisi to curb protests. A widespread hunger strike that began on Saturday to denounce an anti-protest law, is gaining momentum. The strike is being led by activists and journalists who are demanding the release of detainees imprisoned under the law. Meanwhile a blogger and activist who faces one of the harshest sentences under the law was just released on bail. Mr. Alaa Abd El Fattah still faces a retrial. The Egyptian president will be in New York next week for a UN General Assembly meeting. Click here for an Al Jazeera article and here for a Guardian newspaper article about the story.\n\nAnd finally here in the US, very close to where this radio station is located, Daniele Watts, the black actress best known for her role in Django Unchained, was handcuffed by the Los Angeles Police Department before being released. Watts was with her partner, who is white, when she was detained, apparently on suspicion of prostitution. She was fully clothed and said on her Facebook page that she was \"showing affection\" to her husband. But LAPD says they were responding to a complaint of \"indecent exposure.\" Watts wrote, \"As I was sitting in the back of the police car, I remembered the countless times my father came home frustrated or humiliated by the cops when he had done nothing wrong.\" Click here for an LA Times article about the story, and here to read Watts' testimony on Facebook.",

Lucas dijo que sospecha que quienes los vieron en el auto asumieron que Watts era una prostituta y \u00e9l un cliente porque ella es negra y \u00e9l blanco.\n\nEl teniente Andrew Neiman de la polic\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles dijo que los ciudadanos est\u00e1n obligados a identificarse si se lo solicita un agente que tenga sospecha razonable de que podr\u00eda estarse cometiendo una ofensa.\n\nEn este caso, se\u00f1al\u00f3, la sospecha razonable fue creada por el llamado al n\u00famero telef\u00f3nico de atenci\u00f3n de emergencias 911, y Watts y Lucas correspond\u00edan a la descripci\u00f3n y ubicaci\u00f3n proporcionadas por la persona que realiz\u00f3 la llamada.\n\nEl sitio de internet dedicado a las celebridades TMZ present\u00f3 un audio del intercambio verbal entre Watts y la polic\u00eda. Neiman y Bill McCoy, un vocero de la pareja, dijeron que la grabaci\u00f3n es aut\u00e9ntica, aunque su origen es desconocido.\n\nEn la grabaci\u00f3n se escucha a un sargento de la polic\u00eda que le dice a Watts: \"alguien llam\u00f3, lo que me da derecho a estar aqu\u00ed, as\u00ed que me da el derecho de identificarla por ley\".\n\nSe puede escuchar a Watts responder frustrada. Ella estuvo detenida hasta que la polic\u00eda determin\u00f3 que no se cometi\u00f3 ning\u00fan delito.\n\nNeiman dijo que es improbable que se haga p\u00fablica una grabaci\u00f3n de la llamada al 911. Tambi\u00e9n es improbable que se d\u00e9 a conocer el resultado de una investigaci\u00f3n interna del Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles, la cual podr\u00eda tardar meses, agreg\u00f3.\n\nWatts dijo que el comportamiento del agente fue un detonante emocional para ella debido a experiencias personales e hist\u00f3ricas de etiquetaci\u00f3n racial por parte de la polic\u00eda.\n\n\"No fue abusivo\", se\u00f1al\u00f3, \"no fue abiertamente racista\".\n\nDijo que sinti\u00f3 que como si hubiera sido se\u00f1alada a pesar de que no hab\u00eda hecho nada malo.",

Watts insinu\u00f3 que en su detenci\u00f3n hab\u00edan mediado motivos raciales (es afroamericana).\n\nAhora, sin embargo, la Polic\u00eda ofrece una versi\u00f3n de los hechos muy diferente que recoge The Hollywood Reporter. \"Est\u00e1 mintiendo\", afirma, rotundo, el sargento Jim Parker, quien acusa a Watts de realizar \"declaraciones maliciosas y falsas\". Frente a su afirmaci\u00f3n de que estaba vestida y tan solo se besaba, lo que cuenta Parker va mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1: \"Estaban [ella y su novio] manteniendo relaciones sexuales. Ella estaba en el asiento del pasajero, con las piernas fuera del coche\".\n\nDe acuerdo con el testimonio del oficial de la Polic\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles, todo parti\u00f3 de una denuncia que se\u00f1alaba que una pareja estaba participando en un encuentro sexual en un coche, a plena luz del d\u00eda, con la puerta abierta. Los testigos aportaban cuantiosos datos: matr\u00edcula del coche y decripci\u00f3n de la pareja y lo que llevaban puesto. Adem\u00e1s, al menos uno de ellos les fotografi\u00f3. \"La gente no se inventa esta mierda\", remacha Parker.\n\nEl polic\u00eda grab\u00f3 el incidente. Una grabaci\u00f3n que acab\u00f3 filtr\u00e1ndose a la famosa web de cotilleos TMZ. \"Como se puede escuchar, ella empez\u00f3 a montar un l\u00edo\", se defiende Parker. \u00bfQu\u00e9 se escucha en esa grabaci\u00f3n? Entre otras cosas, c\u00f3mo Watts dice: \"\u00bfSab\u00e9is cu\u00e1ntas veces han llamado a los \"polis\" porque soy negra? \u00bfSolo porque soy negra y \u00e9l es blanco? Pod\u00e9is decir que me estoy resistiendo al arresto\".\n\nEl componente racial\n\nWatts utiliz\u00f3 su perfil en Facebook para dar cobertura y repercusi\u00f3n a lo que consideraba un trato abusivo por parte de la Polic\u00eda. Y no dud\u00f3 en utilizar la baza racial. \"Cuando estaba sentada en la parte de atr\u00e1s del coche de Polic\u00eda record\u00e9 las innumerables veces que mi padre lleg\u00f3 a casa frustrado o humillado por la Polic\u00eda sin haber hecho nada malo\", escribi\u00f3. \"Estaba llena de adrenalina y me dol\u00edan las mu\u00f1ecas ensangrentadas, y se me ocurri\u00f3 que, incluso en ese momento, todav\u00eda ten\u00eda poder sobre mi propio esp\u00edritu\".\n\nSu versi\u00f3n contrasta poderosamente con la que da la Polic\u00eda, que afirma que Watts hac\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s que besarse y que fue ella quien provoc\u00f3 un altercado, hasta el punto de que el sargento Parker recurri\u00f3 a una agente femenina para que la esposara y evitar as\u00ed posibles complicaciones. Tiene claro, adem\u00e1s, qu\u00e9 habr\u00eda ocurrido si no hubiera grabado lo ocurrido: \"Los tres [le acompa\u00f1aban dos agentes] estar\u00edamos suspendidos\". La Poic\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles, de momento, ha abierto una investigaci\u00f3n.",

Por eso se dijo v\u00edctima de racismo y public\u00f3 en Facebook un mensaje donde criticaba la supuesta libertad en Estados Unidos.\n\nSin embargo, el portal TMZ publica varias versiones de testigos, quienes presentan una escena totalmente distinta, pues aseguran que la actriz y el chef estaban teniendo sexo en el asiento del copiloto y con la puerta abierta.\n\nWatts hab\u00eda salido alrededor de las 14:00 horas de los estudios de la CBS en el Valle de San Fernando. Personas en un edificio cercano dijeron a los oficiales de polic\u00eda que vieron c\u00f3mo la actriz y el chef tuvieron sexo. \u00c9l estaba en el asiento del copiloto y ella, encima de \u00e9l. Incluso un testigo coment\u00f3 que se limpiaron con un pa\u00f1uelo poco despu\u00e9s.\n\nEn los audios que publica TMZ se escucha c\u00f3mo Danielle se opone a mostrar su identificaci\u00f3n y se dice v\u00edctima de un acto racista. Despu\u00e9s habla de su fama y luego comienza a llorar y es esposada.\n\nLa actriz coment\u00f3 que pensaba demandar al Departamente de Polic\u00eda de Los \u00c1ngeles.",
