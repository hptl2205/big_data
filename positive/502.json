                    "body": "Nurse helped treat missionary, priest who died after contracting Ebola Photos\n\n[Breaking news update at 6:51 p.m. ET]\n\nAnother nurse's assistant in Spain is under observation on suspicion of being infected with the Ebola virus, a spokeswoman at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital said. This person is on the same team as the nurse's assistant who became the first person known to have contracted Ebola outside Africa in the current outbreak.\n\n[Original story published at 4:09 p.m. ET]\n\nSpanish health authorities said Tuesday they are monitoring three more potential cases of Ebola, a day after a nurse's assistant became the first person known to have contracted Ebola outside Africa in the current outbreak.\n\nThe woman helped treat two Spanish missionaries, both of whom had contracted Ebola in West Africa, one in Liberia and the other in Sierra Leone. Both died after returning to Spain.\n\nThe developments come just as the organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) reports that a Norwegian staff member has contracted the deadly virus. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was placed in isolation Sunday after developing a fever, the organization said.\n\nThe worker is being sent to a treatment center in Europe.\n\nIn Spain, no details have yet been given of exactly how the nurse's assistant contracted the virus, and her condition is unknown.\n\nFrancisco Arnalis, head of internal medicine at the Carlos III Hospital, told a news conference that the three other potential Ebola cases are being monitored there.\n\nOne is the assistant's husband, who faces a high risk of infection and had no protection. Another is a suspected case in a man who traveled overseas and has tested negative twice, health officials said.\n\nThe third, a nurse, is not a suspected case but has been brought in as a precaution after suffering diarrhea. She was exposed, but she was wearing protective gear, Arnalis said.\n\nAnother 22 contacts with the nurse's assistant outside the Carlos III Hospital are also being monitored, the head of the hospital said.\n\nThe hospital will not release information about the status of the nurse's assistant, who has not been named, in order to respect her privacy, director Rafael Santamaria said.\n\nThe hospital has two potential treatments at its disposal, said Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas, one using an IV drip with the antibodies of Ebola survivors and the other an antiviral drug.\n\n\"This is a treatment that the WHO (World Health Organization) has recommended, even though they haven't verified its efficacy,\" he said of the IV drip.\n\nEU: We need to know what happened\n\nSpanish authorities have said that all the proper protocols and procedures were followed in the care of the two missionaries. But the European Union has asked for an explanation as to how the woman was infected.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said on Tuesday that \"Spain told us all the protocols have been followed, but obviously something wrong happened.\"\n\nThere have been 10 evacuations of Ebola-infected patients from Africa to Europe, eight of those within the European Union, Vincent said -- and it is first time that something like this has happened.\n\n\"The hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with Ebola patients,\" he said.\n\n\"If protocols are being followed, it's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the EU. But again, zero risk doesn't exist, particularly in a hospital, where staff deal with sick people.\n\n\"We need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures.\"\n\nThere will be an extra meeting of European officials to discuss the Spanish Ebola case on Wednesday, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was \"ready to provide support to Spain, as and if required,\" as it investigates the case and traces the infected woman's contacts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a Cabinet meeting to discuss way to coordinate how to handle response to Ebola there, if it's necessary. Cameron called Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma to discuss the status of the outbreak in the West African nation and talk about how aid the UK has provided is helping.\n\nAccording to Downing Street, the Sierra Leone leader said the situation continues to be \"very serious\" and there was a need to train more medical staff, improve burial processes and develop a better system for running service treatment centers.\n\nUnions question equipment used\n\nSome Spanish unions have blamed the government, saying they warned it that the personal protective equipment used by the medical team was not of the highest standard.\n\nAngry doctors and nurses outside the Carlos III Hospital where the nurse's assistant is being treated -- and where the two missionaries were cared for before her -- said they were outraged the pair had been brought to the hospital, one in August and the other in September.\n\nThey said that the two priests, Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, were almost dead when they arrived, and that they should not have been brought back to Spain, thereby putting other people's lives at risk.\n\nSpanish Health Minister Ana Mato announced Monday that testing had confirmed the nurse's assistant has the virus.\n\nThe husband of the nurse's assistant, who is under observation, is not sick, a spokesman for the Health Ministry said. It was not clear whether he is under quarantine. The couple have no children.\n\nThe assistant was one of about 30 health professionals in Spain who helped treat the Ebola patients. They and the ambulance team that took her to the hospital are now reportedly under observation.\n\nNo word on where she took her vacation\n\nHealth officials said the assistant developed symptoms on September 30. She was not hospitalized until this week, when her only symptom was a fever.\n\nShe was first taken to a hospital in southern Madrid before being transferred to Carlos III Hospital, where she had helped care for the Ebola patients.\n\nThe second of the missionaries died on September 26, and she went on vacation a day later, health officials said. They have not said where that vacation was taken.\n\nA few days later, she reported that she was not feeling well but her temperatures were not very high, officials said. It was only several days later that her temperature soared and she was hospitalized.\n\nAn investigation is underway to find everyone the assistant may have had contact with while infectious. So far, there are no other known related cases.\n\nHealth authorities have urged people to stay calm, as they hope that the virus' spread is contained.\n\n\"We are working in coordination to give the best care to the patient and to guarantee the safety of all citizens,\" said Mato, the health minister.\n\nObama: National security priority\n\nThe news came amid growing fears in the United States that the disease could spread. The first person to be diagnosed in the United States with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, remains in critical but stable condition in Texas, according to Candace White, a spokeswoman for Texas Health. He is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis, she said, adding that his liver function, which declined over the weekend, has improved.\n\nHe is continuing to receive an investigational medication, White said.\n\nDuring a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press conference on Monday, CNN asked Texas Department of State Health Services Dr. David Lakey how care protocols in Spain compared to those involving Duncan in Texas.\n\nLakey said he personally went to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital ward in Dallas where the patient is being treated, and saw that there was extensive security and a detailed method of how providers were protecting themselves. \"They take this really seriously,\" he said, describing treatment protocol as \"meticulous.\"\n\nCDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said none of the people who Duncan came into contact with before his diagnosis that the CDC has identified for monitoring has shown symptoms.\n\nFrieden also said the agency has not made final decisions about possible ways to screen at airports in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the U.S. military personnel being deployed to Liberia to help tackle the Ebola crisis may come into contact with the virus, a Pentagon official said Tuesday.\n\nThe head of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. David Rodriguez, said that while the majority of U.S. troops involved in the mission would not be exposed to the disease, those in mobile testing labs could have contact in that environment.\n\n\"They're all trained at a very, very high level,\" Rodriguez told reporters of the lab personnel, who constitute a \"separate, specialty element of the force.\"\n\nPresident Obama told reporters Monday, \"As I've said from the start of this outbreak, I consider this a top national security priority. This is not just a matter of charity. ... This is an issue about our safety.\"\n\nObama called for protocols to help stop the spread of the disease, including additional air passenger screening, while downplaying the risk of an epidemic in the United States.\n\nEbola has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, with more than 7,400 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.\n\nThe virus is transmitted through close and direct physical contact with infected bodily fluids, the most infectious being blood, feces and vomit. The incubation period, from the time of infection to symptoms, is two to 21 days.\n\nRecommended",

                    "body": "The Spanish nurse who became the first outside of Africa to become infected with Ebola has been named along with her husband.\n\nTeresa Romero Ramos and Javier Limon Romero are being held in quarantine in separate rooms at the same hospital in the Spanish capital.\n\nMs Romero Ramos, 44, from Galicia in northwest Spain, who is one of the medical team that treated two repatriated Spanish priests who died from Ebola, was diagnosed with the killer disease yesterday.\n\nTheir identities came out after Mr Romero asked a Spanish animal charity to start a social media campaign to stop health officials putting his dog down.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHer husband, who lives in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon, raged: 'I want to publicly denounce a man called Zarco, who I think is Head of Health for the community of Madrid and who's told me that I have to sacrifice my dog. He's asked for my consent and I've denied it, to which he responded that they would ask for a court order to enter my house and sacrifice it.'\n\nAnger was growing in Spain meanwhile over how the nurse became infected with Ebola as it was claimed the protective suits given to health officials were not good enough.\n\nFour suspected Ebola patients are now in hospital in Madrid after Teresa Romero Ramos was confirmed as the first person to catch the virus outside of West Africa.\n\nThe escalation in Spain's Ebola outbreak comes as officials revealed 30 people were being monitored for symptoms.\n\nIn a further worrying development, the World Health Organisation says Europe must brace itself for even more outbreaks.\n\nIt has also since emerged that a week before she tested positive for Ebola the nurse had contacted health workers to complain of a fever and fatigue, telling them she had helped treat two priests who contracted Ebola in Africa and were repatriated to Spain.\n\nBut it wasn't until she went to her local hospital on Monday that she was finally admitted and tested for the virus.\n\nIt is not the same hospital where she worked, raising questions over the number of people she has come into contact with.\n\nToday husband Javier, who is also being looked after at the Carlos III Hospital, spoke to respected Spanish daily El Mundo, which managed to get a quick phone interview with him in hospital.\n\nHe sounded fit and in good health during their five-minute chat.\n\nHe told the paper: 'My wife has been working normally and has followed all the normal protocols.\n\n'We've no idea how she could have been infected.\n\n'She's never appeared worried about anything. We were going to go on holiday and couldn't because of an accident I had at work.\n\n'She volunteered to help the second priest who died from Ebola. She was on the rota when the first patient arrived but volunteered second time round.'\n\nAnger was growing in Spain today over how the nurse became infected with Ebola as it was claimed the protective suits given to health officials were not good enough.\n\nFour suspected Ebola patients are now in hospital in Madrid after Teresa Romero Ramos was confirmed as the first person to catch the virus outside of West Africa.\n\nThe escalation in Spain's Ebola outbreak comes as officials revealed 30 people were being monitored for symptoms,\n\nIt has also since emerged that a week before she tested positive for Ebola she had contacted health workers to complain of a fever and fatigue, telling them she had helped treat two priests who contracted Ebola in Africa and were repatriated to Spain.\n\nBut it wasn't until she went to her local hospital on Monday that she was finally admitted and tested for the virus.\n\nIt is not the same hospital where she worked, raising questions over the number of people she has come into contact with.\n\nMeanwhile the World Health Organisation warned that it is 'unavoidable' more cases will be diagnosed in Europe.\n\nWHO's European director Zsuzsanna Jakab said further such events were 'unavoidable'.\n\nShe said: 'Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely.\n\n'It is quite unavoidable... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.'\n\n'It will happen,' she added. 'But the most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral hemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.'\n\nOfficials have said they 'don't know' how the Spanish nurse became infected with the deadly virus.\n\nBut last night staff at the Carlos III hospital where she worked claimed the protective suits they were given were not good enough.\n\nUnnamed sources told Spanish daily El Pais the suits did not meet World Health Organisation standards.\n\nThey said the suits they were issued with were permeable and lacked breathing apparatus.\n\n'At the moment we are investigating the way in which the professional was infected,' said Antonio Alemany, the head of Madrid's primary health care services.\n\n'We don't know yet what failed,' he was quoted by the Guardian as saying. 'We're investigating the mechanism of infection.'\n\nMercedes Vinuesa, the head of Spain's public health service, told parliament today that the nurse's husband had been placed in quarantine. Although he has shown no signs of Ebola, the measures have been taken as a precaution.\n\nIn addition, a second nurse who also treated the priest who died on September 25 was put into quarantine after experiencing diarrhoea but she did not have a fever, the most common initial symptom for Ebola.\n\nA Nigerian man who recently arrived in Spain is also under quarantine but tested negative for Ebola in his first test.\n\nNews of the quarantines has hit Spain's stock market. It is one of Europe's biggest tourist destinations and stocks in companies such as airlines and hotel chains fell on the Madrid stock exchange.\n\nProf Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, said: 'If appropriate containment measures were adopted this really should not have happened.\n\n'It will be crucial to find out what went wrong in this case so necessary measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again.\n\n'As the African outbreak perfectly illustrates, healthcare workers put their life on the line, so everything should be done to ensure that risks are minimised as much as possible.\n\n'As for the suggestion of screening people as they arrive at airports, this would only work if people were already showing symptoms.'\n\nDr Ben Neuman, Lecturer in Virology, University of Reading, said: 'Nurses face a problem in that a person who is sick with Ebola can make quite a lot of highly infectious waste, as the patient loses fluid through diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\n'Those bodily fluids can contain millions of Ebola viruses, and it only takes one to transfer the infection.\n\n'The protective suits that Ebola workers wear provide excellent protection, but there is a danger when it is time to take the suit off.\n\n'It is also possible that a tiny amount of Ebola-containing liquid splashed on the protective garments, and then was transferred to her skin while removing the protective clothing.'\n\nTwo separate tests confirmed that the woman had contracted the disease.\n\nDespite the concerns raised today, colleagues last night expressed their surprise at news the nurse had contracted the virus, saying that there had been 'extreme' measures in place to protect hospital staff.\n\nOne told Spanish daily El Pais that nurses were equipped with two protective overalls, two pairs of gloves and glasses. All medics had to use a special card to access the hospital's sixth floor - where the two men were treated.\n\nThe Carlos III Hospital was evacuated before the arrival of the first missionary, Miguel Pajares, who contracted the disease in Liberia, but not for Mr Viejo as the sixth floor had already been hermetically sealed.\n\nMr Pajares, the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola, died at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital in August despite receiving experimental drug ZMapp after he returned.\n\nMr Viejo died at the hospital the following month after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Spanish nurse is understood to have tested positive for Ebola in a first analysis after going to hospital in Alcorcon near Madrid with a high fever early yesterday morning.\n\nDoctors isolated the emergency treatment room.\n\nA Ministry of Health source told Spanish daily El Mundo: 'She arrived at the University Hospital Alcorcon Foundation with fever and has undergone tests. The first test has come back positive.'\n\nMeanwhile, in Oslo medical teams received their country's first Ebola victim after a Doctors Without Borders worker flew home after testing positive for the virus.\n\nAnne-Cecilie Kaltenborn, the organization's general secretary in Norway, said the Norwegian female doctor started feeling sick over the weekend and was isolated after she came down with a fever on Sunday.\n\n'We don't know how she was infected. We have very strict rules about working in the field, and all our workers use protective clothing,' Ms Kaltenborn told reporters in Oslo. 'She will be placed in an isolation ward in hospital in Oslo after arrival.'\n\nMs Kaltenborn declined to name the worker or give further details pending an investigation by the organization.\n\nShe said Doctors Without Borders has 86 foreign workers among the 1,200 working currently in Sierra Leone.\n\nHealth Minister Bent Hoie said Norway is ready to accept the patient and that health officials had been preparing for months to treat people infected with the virus.\n\nEbola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the virus and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate those who are infected.\n\nThe current outbreak in west Africa, the worst ever, has infected nearly 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 deaths. There have been a handful of cases in the West.\n\nBritish nurse William Pooley, 29, who was infected with the virus while working in Sierra Leone, recovered last month after being flown back to London for treatment.\n\nHe later jetted to the US to give blood to an American battling the disease.\n\nToday in the U.S., video journalist Ashoka Mukpo, who became infected while working in Liberia, arrived at the Nebraska Medical Centre in Omaha. It's not clear how he was infected said his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, adding that on Monday, his symptoms of fever and nausea still appeared mild.\n\nMr Mukpo is the fifth American sick with Ebola brought back from West Africa for medical care.\n\nThe others were aid workers - three have recovered and one remains hospitalised.\n\nThere are no approved drugs for Ebola, so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases.\n\nA critically ill Liberian man hospitalised in Dallas is getting an experimental treatment, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said.\n\nThomas Eric Duncan is the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S., he was admitted to the hospital on September 28.\n\nThe hospital said Mr Duncan was receiving an experimental medication called brincidofovir, which was developed to treat other types of viruses. Laboratory tests suggested it may also work against Ebola.\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry urged the U.S. government to begin screening air passengers arriving from Ebola-affected nations, including taking their temperatures.\n\nBut Federal health officials say a travel ban could make the desperate situation worse in those countries. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said it was not currently under consideration.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said the U.S. will be 'working on protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States.' He did not outline any details.\n\nLeading charity Save the Children warned recently Ebola is spreading at a 'terrifying rate' with the number of recorded cases doubling every week.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in London co-hosted with Sierra Leone last week, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for more financial aid, doctors and nurses.\n\nScientists have warned that the deadly virus could spread across the world infecting people from the U.S. to China within three weeks.\n\nThere is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted.\n\nUsing Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world.\n\nThey estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24.\n\nAnd Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each.\n\nProfessor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities - but those probabilities are growing for everyone.\n\n'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky.\n\n'Air traffic is the driver.",

                    "body": "Fears grew Tuesday that the Ebola epidemic was spreading outside Africa after three more people were isolated in Spain following the infection of a nurse in a Madrid hospital.\n\nThe EU demanded answers about how the disease could have spread in Spain's most specialist unit treating Ebola where the nurse cared for two elderly Spanish missionaries who died from the virus after being flown home from west Africa.\n\nEbola has been raging there since the beginning of the year, with nearly 3,500 confirmed deaths so far.\n\nTests confirmed that the 40-year-old nurse is the first person to contract the virus outside Africa.\n\nDoctors said her husband was at \"high risk\" and has been admitted to the La Paz-Carlos III hospital, where the nurse worked. Another \"suspect case\" -- a man recently returned from abroad -- is also being monitored there.\n\nOne of the nurse's colleagues, who has been suffering from diarrhoea, has also been taken in for observation.\n\nMadrid's stock market fell on the news, with travel and tourism groups worst-hit. Shares in IAG, owner of the Spanish airline Iberia, tumbled more than six percent.\n\n- Nurse ill for five days -\n\nThe infected nurse began to feel ill on September 30 while on leave after treating the two priests in the hospital's isolation unit. But she did not go to hospital until Sunday -- five days later -- complaining of a fever, government officials said.\n\nShe is now being treated in the same unit.\n\nHealth officials said they were trying to find out who she came into contact with, and were monitoring 30 people -- including co-workers -- for Ebola symptoms.\n\nThe infection also sparked questions about how safety procedures were applied when treating the two missionaries.\n\n\"People are freaked out,\" a cardiologist at the hospital told AFP. \"We cannot understand how someone who was wearing a double protection suit and two pairs of gloves could have been contaminated.\"\n\nShe claimed Spain was not up to dealing with the hemorrhagic fever and questioned the decision to repatriate the missionaries.\n\nThe nurse had treated Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, 75, who was infected with Ebola in Liberia and died on August 12, as well as Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who was repatriated from Sierra Leone and died on September 25.\n\nPajares was the first patient in the current Ebola outbreak to be evacuated to Europe for treatment.\n\nThe nurse is believed to have contracted the virus six weeks later while caring for Garcia Viejo. Officials said she visited his room twice, once to clean him and then to collect material after his death.\n\nThe team that cared for the missionaries was closely monitored, they said.\n\nThe European Commission has written to the Spanish health ministry demanding an explanation, a Brussels spokesman said.\n\nThe case followed a wake-up call on Ebola from US President Barack Obama, who warned on Monday that \"some large countries are not doing enough\" to tackle the epidemic.\n\n- 'Training not given' -\n\nElena Moral, leader of the CSIF-AGCM public workers' union, told Spanish public radio: \"The precautionary measures that should have been taken were not effective. The necessary training was not given and we must find out who was responsible.\"\n\nThe head of primary healthcare for the Madrid region, Antonio Alemany, told a news conference that the nurse, who has no children, was in a stable condition but still had a fever.\n\nNews of her infection sparked renewed questions about Madrid's decision to repatriate infected missionaries from Africa. Critics said Spanish hospitals were not equipped to deal with Ebola.\n\n\"We are working to see if all the protocols which were established were strictly followed,\" Health Minister Ana Mato said.\n\n\"Spain follows all the recommendations of the World Health Organization.\"\n\nThe Ebola virus causes fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and sometimes internal and external bleeding.\n\nIt spreads through bodily fluids, and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate those who are infected. There is no vaccine, but one possible treatment, dubbed ZMapp, has been fast-tracked for use.\n\nEbola has caused 3,439 deaths out of 7,478 cases across five west African nations -- Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal -- according to the latest WHO tally.\n\nPatients have been treated for the disease in Europe and the United States, but until now all the cases stemmed from people who caught the virus in west Africa.\n\nUS health officials said a Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in Texas had received an experimental drug called Brincidofovir, the first time the medicine has been used to fight the virus.\n\nAlso on Monday, the charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced that a Norwegian employee had contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone and would be repatriated shortly.\n\nAnother MSF worker, a French nurse, caught the virus while volunteering in neighbouring Liberia but has been cured, the French government said, after being repatriated.\n\nThat has not stopped fear of the disease spreading however, with parents at a primary school in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt refusing to let their children go to school because a pupil had just come back from Guinea, one the countries worst hit by the virus.",

This person is on the same team as the nurse's assistant who became the first person known to have contracted Ebola outside Africa in the current outbreak.\n\n[Original story published at 4:09 p.m. ET]\n\nSpanish health authorities said Tuesday they are monitoring three more potential cases of Ebola, a day after a nurse's assistant became the first person known to have contracted Ebola outside Africa in the current outbreak.\n\nThe woman helped treat two Spanish missionaries, both of whom had contracted Ebola in West Africa, one in Liberia and the other in Sierra Leone. Both died after returning to Spain.\n\nThe developments come just as the organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) reports that a Norwegian staff member has contracted the deadly virus. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was placed in isolation Sunday after developing a fever, the organization said.\n\nThe worker is being sent to a treatment center in Europe.\n\nIn Spain, no details have yet been given of exactly how the nurse's assistant contracted the virus, and her condition is unknown.\n\nFrancisco Arnalis, head of internal medicine at the Carlos III Hospital, told a news conference that the three other potential Ebola cases are being monitored there.\n\nOne is the assistant's husband, who faces a high risk of infection and had no protection. Another is a suspected case in a man who traveled overseas and has tested negative twice, health officials said.\n\nThe third, a nurse, is not a suspected case but has been brought in as a precaution after suffering diarrhea. She was exposed, but she was wearing protective gear, Arnalis said.\n\nAnother 22 contacts with the nurse's assistant outside the Carlos III Hospital are also being monitored, the head of the hospital said.\n\nThe hospital will not release information about the status of the nurse's assistant, who has not been named, in order to respect her privacy, director Rafael Santamaria said.\n\nThe hospital has two potential treatments at its disposal, said Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas, one using an IV drip with the antibodies of Ebola survivors and the other an antiviral drug.\n\n\"This is a treatment that the WHO (World Health Organization) has recommended, even though they haven't verified its efficacy,\" he said of the IV drip.\n\nEU: We need to know what happened\n\nSpanish authorities have said that all the proper protocols and procedures were followed in the care of the two missionaries. But the European Union has asked for an explanation as to how the woman was infected.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said on Tuesday that \"Spain told us all the protocols have been followed, but obviously something wrong happened.\"\n\nThere have been 10 evacuations of Ebola-infected patients from Africa to Europe, eight of those within the European Union, Vincent said -- and it is first time that something like this has happened.\n\n\"The hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with Ebola patients,\" he said.\n\n\"If protocols are being followed, it's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the EU. But again, zero risk doesn't exist, particularly in a hospital, where staff deal with sick people.\n\n\"We need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures.\"\n\nThere will be an extra meeting of European officials to discuss the Spanish Ebola case on Wednesday, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was \"ready to provide support to Spain, as and if required,\" as it investigates the case and traces the infected woman's contacts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a Cabinet meeting to discuss way to coordinate how to handle response to Ebola there, if it's necessary. Cameron called Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma to discuss the status of the outbreak in the West African nation and talk about how aid the UK has provided is helping.\n\nAccording to Downing Street, the Sierra Leone leader said the situation continues to be \"very serious\" and there was a need to train more medical staff, improve burial processes and develop a better system for running service treatment centers.\n\nUnions question equipment used\n\nSome Spanish unions have blamed the government, saying they warned it that the personal protective equipment used by the medical team was not of the highest standard.\n\nAngry doctors and nurses outside the Carlos III Hospital where the nurse's assistant is being treated -- and where the two missionaries were cared for before her -- said they were outraged the pair had been brought to the hospital, one in August and the other in September.\n\nThey said that the two priests, Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, were almost dead when they arrived, and that they should not have been brought back to Spain, thereby putting other people's lives at risk.\n\nSpanish Health Minister Ana Mato announced Monday that testing had confirmed the nurse's assistant has the virus.\n\nThe husband of the nurse's assistant, who is under observation, is not sick, a spokesman for the Health Ministry said. It was not clear whether he is under quarantine. The couple have no children.\n\nThe assistant was one of about 30 health professionals in Spain who helped treat the Ebola patients. They and the ambulance team that took her to the hospital are now reportedly under observation.\n\nNo word on where she took her vacation\n\nHealth officials said the assistant developed symptoms on September 30. She was not hospitalized until this week, when her only symptom was a fever.\n\nShe was first taken to a hospital in southern Madrid before being transferred to Carlos III Hospital, where she had helped care for the Ebola patients.\n\nThe second of the missionaries died on September 26, and she went on vacation a day later, health officials said. They have not said where that vacation was taken.\n\nA few days later, she reported that she was not feeling well but her temperatures were not very high, officials said. It was only several days later that her temperature soared and she was hospitalized.\n\nAn investigation is underway to find everyone the assistant may have had contact with while infectious. So far, there are no other known related cases.\n\nHealth authorities have urged people to stay calm, as they hope that the virus' spread is contained.\n\n\"We are working in coordination to give the best care to the patient and to guarantee the safety of all citizens,\" said Mato, the health minister.\n\nObama: National security priority\n\nThe news came amid growing fears in the United States that the disease could spread. The first person to be diagnosed in the United States with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, remains in critical but stable condition in Texas, according to Candace White, a spokeswoman for Texas Health. He is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis, she said, adding that his liver function, which declined over the weekend, has improved.\n\nHe is continuing to receive an investigational medication, White said.\n\nDuring a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press conference on Monday, CNN asked Texas Department of State Health Services Dr. David Lakey how care protocols in Spain compared to those involving Duncan in Texas.\n\nLakey said he personally went to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital ward in Dallas where the patient is being treated, and saw that there was extensive security and a detailed method of how providers were protecting themselves. \"They take this really seriously,\" he said, describing treatment protocol as \"meticulous.\"\n\nCDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said none of the people who Duncan came into contact with before his diagnosis that the CDC has identified for monitoring has shown symptoms.\n\nFrieden also said the agency has not made final decisions about possible ways to screen at airports in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the U.S. military personnel being deployed to Liberia to help tackle the Ebola crisis may come into contact with the virus, a Pentagon official said Tuesday.\n\nThe head of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. David Rodriguez, said that while the majority of U.S. troops involved in the mission would not be exposed to the disease, those in mobile testing labs could have contact in that environment.\n\n\"They're all trained at a very, very high level,\" Rodriguez told reporters of the lab personnel, who constitute a \"separate, specialty element of the force.\"\n\nPresident Obama told reporters Monday, \"As I've said from the start of this outbreak, I consider this a top national security priority.

                    "body": "MADRID: Spain was investigating on Tuesday (Oct 7) how a nurse in Madrid could have become infected with Ebola, sparking fears of the first outbreak outside Africa.\n\nThe inquiry was launched as the EU demanded answers from the Spanish authorities about how the disease could have spread in a specialist Madrid unit where the woman treated two elderly Spanish missionaries who died from the virus. Tests confirmed she has the disease, government officials said, making her the first person to contract the virus outside Africa.\n\nThe 40-year-old began to feel ill on September 30 while on leave after treating the two patients in the isolation unit of Madrid's La Paz-Carlos III hospital. But she did not go to hospital until Sunday - five days later - complaining of a fever, government officials said. She is now being treated herself in the same unit.\n\nHealth officials said they were trying to find out who she came into contact with, and were monitoring 30 people - including co-workers and her husband - for Ebola symptoms.\n\nThe infection also sparked questions about how safety procedures were applied when treating the two missionaries.\n\n\"People are freaked out,\" a cardiologist at the hospital told AFP. \"We cannot understand how someone who was wearing a double protection suit and two pairs of gloves could have been contaminated.\" She claimed Spain was not up to dealing with the hemorrhagic fever and questioned the decision to repatriate the missionaries.\n\nThe nurse had treated Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, 75, who was infected with Ebola in Liberia and died on August 12, as well as Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who was repatriated from Sierra Leone and died on September 25. Pajares was the first patient in the current Ebola outbreak to be evacuated to Europe for treatment.\n\nThe infected nurse is believed to have contracted the virus six weeks later while caring for Garcia Viejo, whose room officials said she visited twice, once to treat him and once to clean the room.\n\nBoth missionaries were treated in the isolation unit at the hospital, and the medical team that cared for them were closely monitored.\n\nIn Brussels on Tuesday an EU spokesman said the European Commission had written to the Spanish health ministry demanding an explanation. The case followed a wake-up call on Ebola from US President Barack Obama, who warned on Monday that \"some large countries are not doing enough\" to tackle the epidemic.\n\n'TRAINING NOT GIVEN'\n\nElena Moral, leader of the CSIF-AGCM public workers' union, told Spanish public radio: \"The precautionary measures that should have been taken were not effective. The necessary training was not given and we must find out who was responsible.\"\n\nThe head of primary healthcare for the Madrid region, Antonio Alemany, told a news conference late Monday that the nurse, who is married but has no children, was in a stable condition but still had a fever.\n\nNews of her infection sparked renewed questions about Madrid's decision to repatriate infected missionaries from Africa. Critics said the nation's hospitals were not adequately equipped to deal with Ebola.\n\n\"We are working to see if all the protocols which were established were strictly followed,\" Health Minister Ana Mato told the news conference. \"Spain follows all the recommendations of the World Health Organization.\"\n\nThe Ebola virus causes fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and sometimes internal and external bleeding. It spreads through bodily fluids, and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate those who are infected. There is no vaccine to prevent it, but one possible treatment, dubbed ZMapp, has been fast-tracked for use.\n\nEbola has caused 3,439 deaths out of 7,478 cases across five west African nations - Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal, according to the latest WHO tally. Patients have been treated for the disease in Europe and the United States, but until now all the cases stemmed from people who caught the virus in west Africa.\n\nOBAMA'S WARNING\n\nObama has vowed to press world leaders to step up the global fight against the deadly epidemic.\n\nUS health officials said a Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in Texas had received an experimental drug called Brincidofovir, the first time the medicine has been used to fight the virus.\n\nAlso on Monday, the charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced that a Norwegian employee had contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone and would be repatriated shortly.\n\nAnother MSF worker, a French nurse, caught the virus while volunteering in neighbouring Liberia but has been cured, the French government said, after being repatriated. That has not stopped fear of the disease spreading however, with parents at a primary school in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt refusing to let their children go to school because a pupil had just come back from Guinea, one the countries worst hit by the virus.",

                    "body": "Madrid (CNN) -- Four more potential cases of Ebola were under observation Tuesday in Spain, health authorities said Tuesday, a day after a nurse's assistant became the first person known to have contracted the deadly virus outside Africa in the current outbreak.\n\nThe woman helped treat two Spanish missionaries, both of whom had contracted Ebola in West Africa, one in Liberia and the other in Sierra Leone. Both died after returning to Spain.\n\nSpain has outbreak's 1st known case of contracting Ebola outside of Africa\n\nThe developments come just as the organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) reports that a Norwegian staff member has contracted the deadly virus. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was placed in isolation Sunday after developing a fever, the organization said.\n\nThe worker is being sent to a treatment center in Europe.\n\nIn Spain, no details have yet been given of exactly how the nurse's assistant contracted the virus, and her condition is unknown.\n\nFrancisco Arnalis, head of internal medicine at the Carlos III Hospital, told a news conference that the three other potential Ebola cases are being monitored there.\n\nA hospital spokeswoman said later Tuesday that another nurse's assistant -- who is on the same team as the infected nurse's assistant -- is under observation. This more recent case was admitted to the hospital after she \"started having a little bit of a temperature,\" said the spokeswoman, who wasn't named as is customary in Spain.\n\nEarlier, health officials explained that one of the people being monitored is the original nurse's assistant's husband, who faces a high risk of infection and had no protection. Another is a suspected case in a man who traveled overseas and has tested negative twice.\n\nThe fourth, a nurse, is not a suspected case but has been brought in as a precaution after suffering diarrhea. She was exposed, but she was wearing protective gear, Arnalis said.\n\nThirty people from Carlos III Hospital and 22 others -- from Alcorcon hospital plus family members -- are being monitored, according to authorities. It was not immediately known whether the nurse's assistant hospitalized late Tuesday was one of these 30 contacts at Carlos III Hospital.\n\nThe hospital will not release information about the status of the nurse's assistant, who has not been named, in order to respect her privacy, director Rafael Santamaria said.\n\nThe hospital has two potential treatments at its disposal, said Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas, one using an IV drip with the antibodies of Ebola survivors and the other an antiviral drug.\n\n\"This is a treatment that the WHO (World Health Organization) has recommended, even though they haven't verified its efficacy,\" he said of the IV drip.\n\nEU: We need to know what happened\n\nSpanish authorities have said that all the proper protocols and procedures were followed in the care of the two missionaries. But the European Union has asked for an explanation as to how the woman was infected.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said on Tuesday that \"Spain told us all the protocols have been followed, but obviously something wrong happened.\"\n\nThere have been 10 evacuations of Ebola-infected patients from Africa to Europe, eight of those within the European Union, Vincent said -- and it is first time that something like this has happened.\n\n\"The hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with Ebola patients,\" he said.\n\n\"If protocols are being followed, it's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the EU. But again, zero risk doesn't exist, particularly in a hospital, where staff deal with sick people.\n\n\"We need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures.\"\n\nThere will be an extra meeting of European officials to discuss the Spanish Ebola case on Wednesday, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was \"ready to provide support to Spain, as and if required,\" as it investigates the case and traces the infected woman's contacts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a Cabinet meeting to discuss way to coordinate how to handle response to Ebola there, if it's necessary. Cameron called Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma to discuss the status of the outbreak in the West African nation and talk about how aid the UK has provided is helping.\n\nAccording to Downing Street, the Sierra Leone leader said the situation continues to be \"very serious\" and there was a need to train more medical staff, improve burial processes and develop a better system for running service treatment centers.\n\nUnions question equipment used\n\nSome Spanish unions have blamed the government, saying they warned it that the personal protective equipment used by the medical team was not of the highest standard.\n\nAngry doctors and nurses outside the Carlos III Hospital where the nurse's assistant is being treated -- and where the two missionaries were cared for before her -- said they were outraged the pair had been brought to the hospital, one in August and the other in September.\n\nEbola drugs in the works\n\nThey said that the two priests, Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, were almost dead when they arrived, and that they should not have been brought back to Spain, thereby putting other people's lives at risk.\n\nSpanish Health Minister Ana Mato announced Monday that testing had confirmed the nurse's assistant has the virus.\n\nThe husband of the nurse's assistant, who is under observation, is not sick, a spokesman for the Health Ministry said. It was not clear whether he is under quarantine. The couple have no children.\n\nThe assistant was one of about 30 health professionals in Spain who helped treat the Ebola patients. They and the ambulance team that took her to the hospital are now reportedly under observation.\n\nNo word on where she took her vacation\n\nHealth officials said the assistant developed symptoms on September 30. She was not hospitalized until this week, when her only symptom was a fever.\n\nShe was first taken to a hospital in southern Madrid before being transferred to Carlos III Hospital, where she had helped care for the Ebola patients.\n\nThe second of the missionaries died on September 26, and she went on vacation a day later, health officials said. They have not said where that vacation was taken.\n\nA few days later, she reported that she was not feeling well but her temperatures were not very high, officials said. It was only several days later that her temperature soared and she was hospitalized.\n\nAn investigation is underway to find everyone the assistant may have had contact with while infectious. So far, there are no other known related cases.\n\nHealth authorities have urged people to stay calm, as they hope that the virus' spread is contained.\n\n\"We are working in coordination to give the best care to the patient and to guarantee the safety of all citizens,\" said Mato, the health minister.\n\nObama: National security priority\n\nThe news came amid growing fears in the United States that the disease could spread. The first person to be diagnosed in the United States with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, remains in critical but stable condition in Texas, according to Candace White, a spokeswoman for Texas Health. He is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis, she said, adding that his liver function, which declined over the weekend, has improved.\n\nHe is continuing to receive an investigational medication, White said.\n\nDuring a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press conference on Monday, CNN asked Texas Department of State Health Services Dr. David Lakey how care protocols in Spain compared to those involving Duncan in Texas.\n\nLakey said he personally went to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital ward in Dallas where the patient is being treated, and saw that there was extensive security and a detailed method of how providers were protecting themselves. \"They take this really seriously,\" he said, describing treatment protocol as \"meticulous.\"\n\nCDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said none of the people who Duncan came into contact with before his diagnosis that the CDC has identified for monitoring has shown symptoms.\n\nFrieden also said the agency has not made final decisions about possible ways to screen at airports in the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the U.S. military personnel being deployed to Liberia to help tackle the Ebola crisis may come into contact with the virus, a Pentagon official said Tuesday.\n\nThe head of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. David Rodriguez, said that while the majority of U.S. troops involved in the mission would not be exposed to the disease, those in mobile testing labs could have contact in that environment.\n\n\"They're all trained at a very, very high level,\" Rodriguez told reporters of the lab personnel, who constitute a \"separate, specialty element of the force.\"\n\nPresident Obama told reporters Monday, \"As I've said from the start of this outbreak, I consider this a top national security priority. This is not just a matter of charity. ... This is an issue about our safety.\"\n\nObama called for protocols to help stop the spread of the disease, including additional air passenger screening, while downplaying the risk of an epidemic in the United States.\n\nIn Liberia, Ebola is killing Thomas Duncan's neighbors\n\nEbola has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, with more than 7,400 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.\n\nThe virus is transmitted through close and direct physical contact with infected bodily fluids, the most infectious being blood, feces and vomit. The incubation period, from the time of infection to symptoms, is two to 21 days.\n\nCNN's Al Goodman reported from Madrid, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

Ms Jakab said European health workers were most at risk of becoming infected, but added that \"the most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.\"\n\nIt has emerged that the nurse, who had helped treat two Spanish missionaries who died after returning from Africa with the disease, first complained of feeling ill a week before she was diagnosed with Ebola on Monday.\n\nThe 40-year-old is understood to have contacted health workers after complaining of a low fever on September 30. She was only given tests for Ebola however when she turned up at hospital with a high fever on Monday, The Telegraph has reported.\n\nSpanish Ebola patient, Catholic priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, died after being repatriated from Sierra Leone on 22 September 2014\n\nOne of those hospitalised is a health worker who has diarrhoea but no fever. The other is a Spaniard who travelled from Nigeria, said Rafael Perez-Santamaria, head of the Carlos III Hospital where the infected nurse treated the two Spanish missionaries.\n\nHealth officials have said 22 people who came into contact with the nurse are also being monitored. They have not been isolated but they are having their temperature taken twice a day to check for signs of infection.\n\nThe EU has now asked Spain to explain how the nurse contracted the deadly disease, according to an AFP report.\n\nThe 40-year-old nurse, who has not been identified but is said to be in a stable condition, had up to 30 colleagues who also treated the missionaries who died of Ebola at the hospital in Madrid.\n\nA spokesman for the European Commission said the case, the first known case of Ebola spreading within a European country, would be discussed at a Health Security Committee meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"The priority remains to find out what actually happened,\" he said.\n\nOfficials said they were still investigating how the nurse was infected. She went on holiday after the second of the missionaries she had been caring for died on September 25, although, they stressed, she had not left Madrid.\n\nJonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said the Spanish nurse should not have contracted the deadly disease if appropriate containment and control measures had been taken.\n\n\"It will be crucial to find out what went wrong in this case so necessary measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again,\" he told Reuters.\n\nLocal media in Spain yesterday reported that staff at the Madrid hospital where the nurse became infected had claimed their protective suits did not meet health and safety requirements - though this has yet to be substantiated.\n\nMeanwhile, a Norwegian doctor infected with Ebola while working in Sierra Leone has arrived in Norway for treatment. Officials said she was in an isolation ward at Oslo University Hospital.",

She was only given tests for Ebola however when she turned up at hospital with a high fever on Monday.\n\nOne of those hospitalised is a health worker who has diarrhoea but no fever. The other is a Spaniard who travelled from Nigeria, said Rafael Perez-Santamaria, head of the Carlos III Hospital where the infected nurse treated the two Spanish missionaries.\n\nHealth officials have said 22 people who came into contact with the nurse are also being monitored. They have not been isolated but they are having their temperature taken twice a day to check for signs of infection.\n\nThe EU has now asked Spain to explain how the nurse contracted the deadly disease, according to an AFP report.\n\nThe 40-year-old nurse, who has not been identified but is said to be in a stable condition, had up to 30 colleagues who also treated the missionaries who died of Ebola at the hospital in Madrid.\n\nA spokesman for the European Commission said the case, the first known case of Ebola spreading within a European country, would be discussed at a Health Security Committee meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"The priority remains to find out what actually happened,\" he said.\n\nOfficials said they were still investigating how the nurse was infected. She went on holiday after the second of the missionaries she had been caring for died on September 25, although, they stressed, she had not left Madrid.\n\nJonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said the Spanish nurse should not have contracted the deadly disease if appropriate containment and control measures had been taken.\n\n\"It will be crucial to find out what went wrong in this case so necessary measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again,\" he told Reuters.\n\nLocal media in Spain yesterday reported that staff at the Madrid hospital where the nurse became infected had claimed their protective suits did not meet health and safety requirements - though this has yet to be substantiated.\n\nMeanwhile, a Norwegian doctor infected with Ebola while working in Sierra Leone has arrived in Norway for treatment. Officials said she was in an isolation ward at Oslo University Hospital.",

                    "body": "An ambulance carrying a Spanish nurse infected with Ebola arrives at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid early October 7, 2014 in this still image from video. (Reuters / Reuters TV)\n\nHealth officials in Madrid say three more people are in the hospital on suspicion of contracting Ebola. The news comes a day after a nurse who treated two Ebola patients at a city hospital became infected with the disease. One has tested negative.\n\nThe nurse is now being treated with a drip using antibodies from those previously infected with the virus, Reuters reports. Approximately 22 people who have been in contact with the woman, dubbed by media the \"Spanish Ebola nurse,\" have been identified and are being monitored, Madrid health officials told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe officials added that the hospitalized include the nurse's husband, another health worker and a traveler who had spent time in one of the affected West African countries. One of the hospitalized - the female health worker- was reported to have tested negative for Ebola late on Tuesday, according to a Reuters health source in Spain. She had displayed only one potential symptom - diarrhea - but was not running a fever.\n\nSpain's Public Health director, Mercedes Vinuesa, told parliament that authorities were compiling a list of everyone who had come in contact with the nurse so that they could be monitored, AP reports.\n\nVinuesa said Spain had several treatments available and was employing them Monday. The unidentified nurse is reportedly in stable condition.\n\nThe 44-year-old woman is the first known person to have become infected with Ebola outside of Africa during the current outbreak. Other cases in Spain - and recently, the US - involved individuals contracting the disease while in Africa and then traveling back to their home countries.The nurse had reportedly helped treat a Spanish missionary and a Spanish priest, both of whom came down with the virus while in West Africa and later died after returning to Spain.\n\nThere is currently no proven known cure or human-safe vaccine for Ebola, which is spread via bodily fluids. Initial symptoms of fever and sore throat develop into vomiting, diarrhea and profuse internal and external bleeding. Victims may die of multiple organ failure within days of first contact, with some strains killing up to 90 percent of sufferers.\n\nThe latest outbreak first struck the West African state of Guiana in December 2013. World Health Organization (WHO) officials, however, did not become aware the disease was raging in the country's south until March 23, 2014. It has since spread to neighboring Senegal, Liberia and Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Due to a rapid response by authorities in Nigeria and Senegal, infections in both states combined were kept below two dozen.\n\nApart from Spain, the United States is the only other non-African country to register a case of Ebola. On September 20, an infected man traveling from Liberia arrived in Dallas, Texas. He reportedly started exhibiting symptoms of the disease 4 days later. US health officials are currently monitoring 10 quarantined people who had contact with the man, who remains in critical condition.\n\nThe WHO has reported a total of 7,493 Ebola infections worldwide. At least 3,439 people are estimated to have died after contracting the disease.\n\nIn September, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted that 1.4 million people could contract Ebola by the end of January barring drastic attempts to head off the spread of infection.\n\nSpanish authorities have come under increasing pressure to explain how the disease was able to spread in one of their hospitals. While they say all proper procedures were followed while providing care to the deceased missionaries, reports to the contrary have surfaced.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, staff at the hospital said waste from the rooms of both patients had been carried out in the same elevator used by all personnel. The hospital was also reportedly not evacuated when the second patient, Garc\u00eda Viejo, was taken in to receive treatment.\n\nUnion workers also accused the government of providing hospital staff with inadequate protective clothing.\n\nSome Spanish health workers' representatives said the situation should prompt an overhaul of procedures and facilities used to treat those afflicted with the virus.\n\n\"Something went wrong,\" M\u00e1ximo Gonzalez Jurado, head of Spain's General Nursing Council, told Spanish news agency EFE. \"They need to establish if the protocol is correct or not correct so that a case like this, that never should have happened, doesn't happen again.\"",

The woman, a \"sanitary technician,\" entered Garcia Viejo's room only twice, according to Spanish officials.\n\nIn one case, she entered the room to change his diaper; another time, after he had died, she entered to collect his belongings, according to Mercedes Vinuesa Sebastian, Spain's public health director. Both times, the nurse wore personal protective equipment.\n\nSpanish officials said they do not know what went wrong and are investigating.\n\n\"We are working to verify the exact source of contact to see if all strict protocols were followed,\" Spanish Health Minister Ana Mato said at a news conference on Monday, according to NBC News.\n\nEuropean Union officials have issued a letter to Mato asking for clarification about how the nurse became infected even though all EU member states were required to take measures to avoid transmission.\n\n\"There is obviously a problem somewhere,\" European Commission spokesman Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vincent said, according to the Guardian.\n\nHealth workers at the Carlos III Hospital protested on Tuesday, and others have raised concerns that the protective suits used by workers treating Ebola patients at the facility are not adequate. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, hospital staff provided photos of protective suits that use latex gloves attached using tape. Hospital staff members told the paper that the protective equipment should have been completely impermeable, but that it was not. The workers also said that the suits did not allow for autonomous breathing.\n\nHospital officials denied that World Health Organization recommendations were not followed in the treatment of both Garcia Viejo and another Spanish priest, 75-year-old Miguel Pajares, who died of Ebola after being flown from West Africa to Spain, where he received the experimental drug ZMapp.\n\n[Exclusive: How the world failed to stop the Ebola epidemic]\n\n\"The suits used perfectly meet protocol, as well as the mandatory protection requirements for this disease,\" said Yolanda Fuentes, the deputy director of Carlos III hospital, according to El Pais.\n\nThe WHO recommendations detail, in general terms, the types of equipment that are appropriate for treating a patient with hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola. The WHO also outlines procedures for entering and exiting an infected patient's room, removing protective equipment and decontaminating surfaces inside and outside a patient's room. Failure to follow any of the steps in those procedures could potentially lead to infection.\n\nHospital staff also alleged that waste from the patient's room was removed using an elevator that was shared by all hospital personnel, according to the Guardian.\n\nThe nurse who contracted Ebola began experiencing symptoms on Sept. 30, five days after Garcia Viejo died. Tests confirmed on Monday that she had contracted Ebola.\n\nAfter treating both Garcia Viejo and Pajares, the woman went on a vacation but remained in Madrid, officials said, according to Reuters.\n\nOn Tuesday, 22 people who came into contact with the nurse were being monitored, but not isolated, according to Rafael Perez-Santamaria, head of the Carlos III Hospital.\n\nThe nurse's husband, who is not showing symptoms, and another health worker who is experiencing diarrhea but not fever, have been hospitalized. Early signs of Ebola infection include fever, diarrhea and headaches.\n\nA Spanish man who recently returned from Nigeria has also been hospitalized, though the first test came back negative for Ebola, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOfficials \"even announced plans to euthanize the woman's pet dog\" in an effort the contain the virus, the AP reported.\n\nMadrid's regional government even got a court order to euthanize and incinerate their pet, \"Excalibur,\" against the couple's objections. The government said available scientific knowledge suggests a risk that the mixed-breed dog could transmit the virus to humans, and promised to use \"biosecurity\" measures to prevent any such transmission.\n\nThe incident has raised fresh concerns that, despite assurances from global public health officials that Ebola cases can be safely managed in developed countries, sufficient precautions have not been taken.\n\nThe WHO's European director told Reuters that additional imported cases in Europe are \"unavoidable.\"\n\n\"Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,\" said Zsuzsanna Jakab. \"It is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.\"\n\n[This post originally cited an AP report that said a Nigerian has been hospitalized in Spain. The AP has updated its reporting to say that the man is Spanish and had recently traveled to Nigeria.

Three other people, including her husband, were placed in quarantine on Tuesday, while a further 52 health workers have been put under observation by the health authorities.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBritish fianc\u00e9e of cameraman with Ebola tells of anguish at being unable to touch him\n\n07 Oct 2014\n\nUS plan more airport screenings for Ebola\n\n06 Oct 2014\n\nBritish-American contracted Ebola 'cleaning infected car'\n\n06 Oct 2014\n\nBritish-American TV cameraman contracts Ebola in Liberia\n\n03 Oct 2014\n\nGirlfriend of Ebola victim: 'We are depending on God to save our lives'\n\n03 Oct 2014\n\nFirst case of Ebola diagnosed in US\n\n30 Sep 2014\n\nThe 44-year-old nurse was part of the medical team that treated Manuel Garcia Viejo (picturted) on his return to Spain.

They said they had been issued with substandard overalls which were not entirely impermeable, and that they should also have been given breathing apparatus, although medical experts say the latter is not considered essential as Ebola is not airborne.\n\nHealth workers attend a protest outside La Paz Hospital in Madrid. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\nQuestions have also been raised as to why it took so long to isolate the nurse after she began to feel unwell on September 30.\n\nShe reportedly contacted health workers to tell them she was suffering from a low fever and fatigue, explaining that she had assisted in the care of the missionaries.\n\nBut it was not until she presented herself at her local hospital with a high fever early on Monday that she was finally admitted and tested positive to the deadly haemorrhagic virus.\n\nSpanish officials also took the extra precaution of taking away her pet dog to be put down, amid concerns that the dog could have acted as a carrier of the virus.\n\nMs Romero is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of west Africa, where the virus has now claimed nearly 3,500 lives.\n\nThe outbreak, which began in Guinea in December, has spread mainly to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, but isolated cases have also been reported in Nigeria, Senegal and last week also in the US, where a man tested positive after flying to Texas from Liberia.\n\nThomas Eric Duncan has been in critical condition at a Dallas hospital since Saturday, and has been put on a kidney dialysis machine.\n\nSpain's opposition parties called for the resignation of Ana Mato, the health minister of Spain's conservative government over her handling of the crisis. A European public health safety committee will also meet on Wednesday to review the situation, amid fears that the Madrid outbreak could spread to other countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Zsuzsanna Jakab, the director of the World Health Organisation, predicted that further outbreaks would almost Ebola virus would almost inevitably take place in Europe, given the extensive air links between the European capitals and west Africa.\n\n\"Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,\" Ms Jakab said. \"It is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around,\" she said.\n\nPassengers travelling from Ebola-infected nations in west Africa currently undergo temperature checks before boarding flights, with anyone registering a thermometer reading of 38C banned from boarding. But given that the virus has an incubation period of up to three weeks, it is impossible to screen with complete effectiveness.\n\nWhile some airlines have suspended direct flights to infected countries, such as British Airways, United Nations health chiefs have lobbied for others to remain in operation, arguing that a complete ban on international air travel would hamper the international aid effort.\n\nDespite the Spanish case, Ms Jakab said a widespread outbreak in Europe was unlikely because of the high standard of health services and public sanitation. \"The most important thing in our view is that Europe is still at low risk, and the Western part of the European region particularly is the best-prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she saw no reason yet for screening at Europe's borders of travellers coming from the affected countries in West Africa, despite plans for such measures in the US.",

Some 30 other health workers and those who came in contact with her are now being monitored for symptoms.\n\nBoth priests died shortly after reaching Spain. Each had worked in West Africa, where an epidemic of Ebola has spread through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since March, killing more than 3,400 people in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Cases have also reached Senegal and Nigeria.\n\nSpanish officials said they still had to find out how the nurse, who was not named but identified as married with no children, contracted the viral infection, which causes fever and bleeding.\n\n\"At the moment we are investigating the way in which the professional was infected,\" Antonio Alemany, the head of Madrid's primary health care services told a news conference.\n\nThe nurse was one of a specialist team who treated elderly priest Manuel Garcia Viejo at the Madrid hospital Carlos III when he was repatriated from Sierra Leone with Ebola on Sept 21. He died four days later.\n\nGarcia Viejo was kept in isolation during his treatment last month and officials said they followed a strict protocol designed to protect health workers and patients at the hospital.\n\nThe nurse who has since fallen ill only entered Garcia Viejo's room twice, once after his death, Alemany said.\n\nHealth authorities said she had also helped treat Miguel Pajares, who had been working in Liberia when he came down with the disease. He was airlifted back to Spain on Aug 7 and died five days later.\n\nThe Spanish nurse went on holiday immediately after Garcia's death on Sept 25 and began feeling sick on Sept 30, said Alemany. He did not say where the nurse went on holiday.\n\n\"We have started studying all of the contacts the patient had since her symptoms began, including the health professionals who have been treating her,\" Alemany said. The nurse's husband was also being monitored, he said.\n\nScientists tracking the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and analyzing air traffic data have predicted a high risk of a case being imported unwittingly into Europe before the end of this month.\n\nThe first Ebola case to be diagnosed in the United States was identified last week in a man from Liberia, who U.S. health officials say is now in a critical condition.\n\nThe Geneva-based WHO said it was notified of the Spanish case at around 3:00 p.m. EDT on Monday.\n\n\"This was a preliminary notification and Spain is doing an intensive investigation into the mode of transmission and into the contacts of the nurse,\" a WHO spokeswoman said.\n\nPatients are at their most contagious when Ebola is in its terminal stages, inducing both internal and external bleeding, and profuse vomiting and diarrhea - all of which contain high concentrations of infectious virus.\n\nBut the disease can also have a long incubation period - up to 21 days - meaning that people can be unaware for weeks that they are infected, and not feel or display any symptoms.\n\nVirologist Benjamin Neuman of the Britain's University of Reading said health workers always face risks handling Ebola patients regardless of whether they used protective equipment.\n\n\"Nurses face a problem in that a person who is sick with Ebola can make quite a lot of highly infectious waste, as the patient loses fluid through diarrhea and vomiting,\" he said.\n\n\"Those bodily fluids can contain millions of Ebola viruses, and it only takes one to transfer the infection.\"\n\nThe nurse, who was initially treated for fever symptoms at the hospital of Alcorcon, in the outskirts of Madrid, was due to be transferred later on Monday to the Madrid hospital Carlos III where Garcia Viejo was treated.\n\nShe is in a stable condition, health officials said.",

She was part of a team that treated two Ebola patients who were repatriated from West Africa after contracting the disease.\n\nThe medical team treated a missionary, Miguel Pajares, 75, who was repatriated home from Liberia in August and died five days later. The same team took care of Mario Garcia Viejo, 69, a Spanish missionary who got infected in Sierra Leone and was flown to Madrid for treatment four days before he died on Sept. 25.\n\nThe woman had contact with Viejo twice: Once when he was still alive and she had to change his diapers, and a second time after he died and she had to take out his sheets, clothing and bodily wastes, public health official said.\n\nShe went on holiday after Viejo's death, although officials insist she never left Madrid.\n\nOfficials said the woman wasn't feeling well for a week before she was admitted to the isolation unit. El Mundo daily reported that it was the nurse who asked repeatedly to be tested for Ebola, before it was done on Monday.\n\nSince her disease was diagnosed, her husband, who has no sign of disease, and two more people, including a colleague who treated Viejo, are being monitored in the hospital in a bid to try to stop the spread of the deadly virus.\n\nIn addition, health authorities said they are monitoring more than 50 possible contacts of the nurse's aide.\n\nThe team has a strict safety protocol in place, which includes double impregnated gowns, gloves, masks and protective eye glasses, according to health officials.\n\n\"We are investigating how she got contaminated and if protocols were respected,\" said Rosa Serrano, an official with Spanish health ministry.\n\nStaff at the hospital told El Pais daily that the protective gowns they were using did not meet World Health Organization criteria, which require them to be impermeable and have a breathing equipment. Staff also complained about low quality latex gloves.\n\nSpain was the first European country to repatriate home infected patients for treatment. Some health professionals said that Spanish hospitals were not well equipped to handle Ebola patients.\n\n\"For instance, in the U.S. there are 10 hospitals with level 4 isolation and here only Carlos III with level 2 and level 3,\" said Pedro Martinez of AMYTS, the union representing doctors.\n\nDespite the situation in Spain, European Health Commission thinks that a European Ebola epidemic \"is very unlikely, and that in some way it could be a lesson for other member states,\" Vincent said.",

                    "body": "A nurse who cared for an Ebola patient repatriated to a Madrid hospital has contracted the disease, the Spanish health ministry announced on 6 October. The news is unfortunately not surprising, however.\n\nAlthough Ebola is relatively difficult to catch in the community because infection requires contact with the bodily fluids -- such as blood or vomit -- of an infected person, close contacts and health-care workers treating Ebola patients have long been recognised as groups most at risk of contracting the virus.\n\nHealth-care workers have already paid a heavy price in the current epidemic in west Africa: as of 1 October, the World Health Organization estimates that 382 have contracted Ebola, and 216 of them have died.\n\nSpanish authorities will investigate how the nurse at the Carlos III hospital came to be infected, and whether there were any shortcomings in infection control -- such as in the personal protective equipment supplied, training in its use, or in hospital hygiene. As someone who recently treated an Ebola patient, the nurse would have been considered a contact at risk of exposure to the virus, and have been monitored for any symptoms such as fever, that could signal the onset of Ebola. Such surveillance of contacts is critical to preventing any onward spread of virus.\n\nIt's important to remember that people with Ebola don't become infectious until they start showing symptoms, so monitoring of contacts of an Ebola-infected patient for fever is usually considered sufficient, with them being isolated only at the first hint of illness -- although some authorities may choose to quarantine high-risk contacts. Such early isolation is crucial to limit the number of people they could come into contact with.\n\nA key question for Spanish authorities will be whether there was any delay between when the nurse first showed symptoms and when she was isolated. They will then try to trace every single person she was in contact during that period and monitor them for symptoms for 21 days, the maximum incubation period of the disease (see \"How disease detectives are fighting Ebola's spread\" for an explainer of this process of 'contact tracing').\n\nThat contacts of the nurse might in turn become infected cannot be ruled out, but the case does not raise any major threat of an outbreak of Ebola in Europe. Risk assessments of the current outbreak have long factored in the prospect that infected people would occasionally travel from the epicentre of the epidemic in west Africa to distant unaffected areas, and that healthcare workers are among those most at risk of secondary infections.\n\nThe Spanish case raises legitimate concerns as to the preparedness of hospitals to safely treat Ebola patients, and spotlights the need for health facilities everywhere to review their own precautions and practice. But even with the best training and equipment, the infectious nature of bodily fluids that carry Ebola means that accidental infections of healthcare workers treating patients with the virus will unfortunately continue.\n\nIn its latest risk assessment, the the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reiterated that \"if a symptomatic case of [Ebola] presents in an EU Member State, secondary transmission to caregivers in the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be ruled out.\" Europe's well-developed public health services are, however, well-placed to quickly stamp-out any further chains of transmission using contact tracing.\n\nThe big lessons of the new Spanish case, as in the recent case of a traveler from Liberia diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas, Texas, are the same: that unless the international community acts far faster, and on a far larger-scale, to tackle Ebola at its source in west Africa, exported cases and the repatriation of sick health-care workers will continue - and family, and healthcare workers caring for them will continue to become infected with Ebola.",

Both died after returning to Spain.\n\nThe developments come just as the organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) reports that a Norwegian staff member has contracted the deadly virus. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was placed in isolation Sunday after developing a fever, the organization said.\n\nThe worker is being sent to a treatment center in Europe.\n\nIn Spain, no details have yet been given of exactly how the nurse's assistant contracted the virus, and her condition is unknown.\n\nFrancisco Arnalis, head of internal medicine at the Carlos III Hospital, told a news conference that the three other potential Ebola cases are being monitored there.\n\nA hospital spokeswoman said later Tuesday that another nurse's assistant -- who is on the same team as the infected nurse's assistant -- is under observation. This more recent case was admitted to the hospital after she \"started having a little bit of a temperature,\" said the spokeswoman, who wasn't named as is customary in Spain.\n\nEarlier, health officials explained that one of the people being monitored is the original nurse's assistant's husband, who faces a high risk of infection and had no protection. Another is a suspected case in a man who traveled overseas and has tested negative twice.\n\nThe fourth, a nurse, is not a suspected case but has been brought in as a precaution after suffering diarrhea. She was exposed, but she was wearing protective gear, Arnalis said.\n\nThirty people from Carlos III Hospital and 22 others -- from Alcorcon hospital plus family members -- are being monitored, according to authorities. It was not immediately known whether the nurse's assistant hospitalized late Tuesday was one of these 30 contacts at Carlos III Hospital.\n\nThe hospital will not release information about the status of the nurse's assistant, who has not been named, in order to respect her privacy, director Rafael Santamaria said.\n\nThe hospital has two potential treatments at its disposal, said Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas, one using an IV drip with the antibodies of Ebola survivors and the other an antiviral drug.\n\n\"This is a treatment that the WHO (World Health Organization) has recommended, even though they haven't verified its efficacy,\" he said of the IV drip.\n\nEU: We need to know what happened\n\nSpanish authorities have said that all the proper protocols and procedures were followed in the care of the two missionaries. But the European Union has asked for an explanation as to how the woman was infected.\n\nEuropean Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said on Tuesday that \"Spain told us all the protocols have been followed, but obviously something wrong happened.\"\n\nThere have been 10 evacuations of Ebola-infected patients from Africa to Europe, eight of those within the European Union, Vincent said -- and it is first time that something like this has happened.\n\n\"The hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with Ebola patients,\" he said.\n\n\"If protocols are being followed, it's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the EU. But again, zero risk doesn't exist, particularly in a hospital, where staff deal with sick people.\n\n\"We need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures.\"\n\nThere will be an extra meeting of European officials to discuss the Spanish Ebola case on Wednesday, he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was \"ready to provide support to Spain, as and if required,\" as it investigates the case and traces the infected woman's contacts.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a Cabinet meeting to discuss way to coordinate how to handle response to Ebola there, if it's necessary. Cameron called Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma to discuss the status of the outbreak in the West African nation and talk about how aid the UK has provided is helping.\n\nAccording to Downing Street, the Sierra Leone leader said the situation continues to be \"very serious\" and there was a need to train more medical staff, improve burial processes and develop a better system for running service treatment centers.",

                    "body": "BARCELONA, Spain -- Spain's government came under heavy criticism Tuesday as it dealt with the repercussions of Western Europe's first Ebola case, quarantining three more people and monitoring dozens who had come into contact with an infected nurse.\n\nHealth care workers, who have been sparring with the government over cutbacks, said they had not received proper training or equipment to handle an Ebola case. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, asked for an explanation, according to news reports. And some opposition politicians called for the health minister, Ana Mato, to resign.\n\nAt a news conference in Madrid, officials insisted that they had taken all appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the virus. But in a sign of the government's unease with the possible political consequences, a lower-ranking official, Mar\u00eda Mercedes Vinuesa, director of public health, went before Parliament on Tuesday to answer questions, not Ms. Mato.\n\nThe infected nurse, who has not been identified, was described as being in stable condition. Her husband and two other people were quarantined, and monitoring was extended to about 50 people who were believed to have come into contact with her.\n\nHealth officials have said that the nurse became infected while treating a missionary, Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, who died in the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid on Sept. 25, after being repatriated from Sierra Leone. Officials said the nurse went on vacation the day after he died, then told a medical center that she had a fever of about 100 degrees on Sept. 30. She was hospitalized only on Monday, initially in another establishment without any unit specifically for handling diseases like Ebola..\n\nThe nurse's husband has shown no signs of having the disease but was isolated as a precaution, said Dr. Francisco Arnalich, head of internal medicine at the hospital.\n\nReached by phone in his hospital ward, the nurse's husband told the newspaper El Mundo that the couple had canceled vacation plans after he had an accident at work, and that his wife had decided to spend a few days at her mother's, instead. He did not specify the mother's location. He said that he felt fine and that he was confident his own health was evolving \"favorably.\" But he said he was angered to hear that the medical authorities were recommending, as a precaution, that their dog be euthanized.\n\nThe husband, identified by the newspaper as Javier, said his wife, identified as Teresa, had told him that she followed all the safety instructions set by the hospital and did not know how she could have become infected. The case is worrisome because Spain is a developed country that is expected to have the rigorous infection control protocols needed to fight the spread of Ebola.\n\nA second nurse who also treated the missionary was put under quarantine after reporting diarrhea, but she did not have a fever, the most common early symptom of Ebola, health officials said.\n\nA Nigerian man who recently arrived in Spain is also under quarantine but tested negative for Ebola, according to Spanish health authorities. A second test is to be carried out Wednesday.\n\nOpposition politicians said Tuesday that Ms. Mato, the health minister, needed to explain any safety lapse, while some called for her immediate removal. Caridad Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez, a lawmaker from the United Left party, said on Twitter that Ms. Mato should resign, saying she had ignored warnings from health workers about inadequate safety measures.\n\nMs. Vinuesa told Parliament that the authorities were drawing up a list of all the people who might have come into contact with the infected nurse. She said Spain had different treatments for Ebola, but offered no further details.\n\nAmid recent tensions between Spanish health care workers and the government over spending cuts in the health sector, representatives of medical unions were quoted on Spanish news media websites as saying that austerity measures had left health workers poorly trained and ill-equipped to handle an Ebola case.\n\nCarlos III Hospital was specifically selected by Spain to welcome repatriated Ebola patients, and Yolanda Fuentes, a deputy director of the hospital, said Monday that the protective suits worn by health workers \"comply perfectly with the protocol and the required protective measures for this disease.\"\n\nThe European Commission wrote to the government in Madrid requesting an explanation of how the nurse was infected, Agence France-Presse reported, quoting Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vincent, a spokesman for the commission. A European health safety committee is set to meet on Wednesday to review the situation.\n\n,Mr. Vincent said it was \"highly improbable\" that the virus would spread further across Europe.\n\nAs an assistant nurse, the woman who became infected had only twice entered the room of the missionary who died of Ebola, including once after his death, according to Antonio Alemany, a health official from the regional government of Madrid.\n\nThe nurse, who is believed to be in her 40s, came into contact with 22 other people, mostly medical staff members in a hospital in Alcorc\u00f3n, on the outskirts of Madrid, where she was initially treated on Monday before being transferred to Carlos III Hospital shortly after midnight, according to Rafael P\u00e9rez-Santamarina, the general manager of the La Paz hospital, a larger establishment that oversees the Carlos III hospital. Mr. P\u00e9rez-Santamarina told reporters that the nurse was being treated on Tuesday using antibodies from other patients who had survived the disease.",

How does this happen? It's really scary.\"\n\nFew details have emerged about the first person known to have contracted the Ebola virus outside west Africa. The Spanish nurse, who tested positive on Monday, was part of a team that cared for two elderly Spanish missionaries who both died after being evacuated to Madrid for treatment.\n\nOn Tuesday night her husband said she had followed all the regulations. \"She did all that they told her to. At no moment was she worried about being infected,\" he told El Mundo. The pair had intended to go on holiday, but changed their plans after he injured his leg, he told the newspaper in a phone interview from the room where he has been isolated.\n\nHe complained that health authorities had told him his dog would have to be put down because it had been in contact with his wife. \"They told me that if I didn't give them my authorisation, they would get a court order and enter the house by force to kill the dog. Then what will they do next? Sacrifice me too?\"\n\nIn Alcorc\u00f3n, a city of 170,000 people on the outskirts of Madrid, many wondered just how worried they should be.\n\n\"She might have been living in this neighbourhood for days with Ebola,\" said Felican. \"Did she go to the supermarket? The gym? We don't know anything.\" Three primary schools ringed the hospital where the nurse had tested positive, she pointed out, and all of them were open on Tuesday.\n\nHer concerns were echoed inside the imposing hospital. Juan Pulido, who sat casually flipping through a newspaper while he waited for his wife to finish her appointment, said his family had urged him not to go. \"Every day I sit here, waiting for my wife. I decided today would be no exception,\" said the retiree, brushing off their worries. \"But it seems like nobody else dared to come - it's empty today.\"\n\nThe infected nurse was transported to Madrid's Carlos III hospital late on Monday. She was placed in isolation, as was her husband, who has shown no signs of the virus. Health officials said on Tuesday they were monitoring 50 more people who may have come into contact with the nurse.\n\nAuthorities placed a second nurse from the same team in isolation after she complained of diarrhoea. Noting that she did not have a fever, the most common initial symptom for Ebola, doctors said her initial test results were negative.\n\nA man who had recently travelled from Nigeria to Spain was also in quarantine at the same hospital but tested negative for Ebola in his first test.\n\nHealth authorities said they had two priorities: compiling a list of all the potential contacts that the woman had before being hospitalised, and determining exactly how she had been infected.\n\nThe nurse had helped care for Miguel Pajares, 75, who was the first person to be repatriated to European soil for treatment in August, but she is thought to have become infected while looking after Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, 69, who died in Madrid after being evacuated from Sierra Leone two weeks ago.\n\nThe nurseShe would have entered Garc\u00eda Viejo's room twice, said Antonio Alemany, from the regional government of Madrid. The first time to was to change a nappy and the second time was to collect material from his room after he died.\n\nAfter complaining of a fever on 30 September, the nurse was told to check herself into hospital if her temperature exceeded 38.6C. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, of Spain's health ministry, acknowledged on Tuesday that it might have been better to have admitted her to hospital right away despite her not showing serious symptoms.\n\nWhen she was admitted on Monday, the nurse remained in a bed in the emergency room, separated from other patients only by curtains, while waiting for her test results to come back, hospital staff said.\n\nSeveral associations representing health professionals in Spain painted a picture of a healthcare system reeling from cutbacks, drastically underfunded to tackle the challenge of Ebola, and led by a health ministry creating policy on the fly.\n\nElena Moral, of the CSI-F, a union that represents healthcare professionals, said the delay in admitting the nurse to hospital hinted at deep flaws in the protocol. \"A patient suspected of having Ebola and a history of working with Ebola patients should have been put in the first ambulance they could find.\"\n\nShe dismissed any suggestion of human error, pointing to a lack of training, infrastructure and safety measures. In some cases, training for health professionals dealing with Ebola was limited to a 15- or 20-minute talk, she said.\n\nIn July a group of nurses in Madrid brought a complaint before a judge in Madrid over the \"lack of training and knowledge regarding protocols\" when it came to treating potential Ebola cases.\n\nMoral also laid blame on the impact of austerity measures on the Spanish healthcare system. \"We've been protesting for a long time that the dismantling of the Carlos III hospital could provoke extreme situations like this one.\"\n\nIn recent years, she said, the Carlos III hospital was closed, gutted of its emergency rooms and then turned into a hospital specialising in tropical diseases.\n\n\"The repatriation of the two missionaries turned the hospital into something just short of a field hospital. Authorities activated the protocols without keeping in mind the actual state of the hospital.\"\n\nOpposition politicians called on the health minister, Ana Mato, to explain the safety lapses, while around 200 health professionals gathered outside a hospital in Madrid calling for her resignation.\n\nThe European commission said it had written to Mato \"to obtain some clarification\" as to how the nurse had become infected. \"There is obviously a problem somewhere,\" said the commission spokesman, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vincent.\n\nSpanish health authorities said medics treating Ebola patients in Spain followed the protocols laid out by the World Health Organisation, but their claims were widely disputed. While level 4 protective equipment is required to attend to Ebola patients, healthcare workers in Spain who treated the missionaries had only level 2 equipment, said Juan Carlos Mejias, of Satse, a union that represents nurses. \"Level 4 is what's being used in other European countries.\"\n\nIn August, when Satse learned of plans to repatriate a patient with Ebola to Spain for treatment, it asked the health ministry for a written description of the protocols that would be used. \"How many nurses would be involved? How would the nurses be monitored afterwards?\" said Mejias. He said the union received no response, suggesting \"there was a serious improvisation in how the situation was handled\".\n\nInside Alcorc\u00f3n hospital, two women working at the hospital gift shop said they knew only what had been reported in the media. \"Our co-worker left after her shift last night wondering why there were journalists outside the hospital. Nobody told us anything or warned us that we should be careful,\" said one. \"At least they could have given us hand sanitiser.\"",

The city of Madrid got a court order to euthanize and incinerate the woman's dog over her and her husband's objections, according to the Associated Press. The dog is a mixed breed pooch named Excalibur.\n\nThe government said available scientific knowledge suggests a risk that the dog could transmit the virus to humans.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a news conference today, \"We have not identified this as means of transmission,\" but declined to comment on the actions by Madrid officials.\n\nTexas health commissioner David Lakey, who has said they are monitoring about 50 people who had contact with the Ebola patient in Dallas, said, \"We are not monitoring any animals at this time.\"\n\nThe Spanish patient, who has not been publicly identified, worked as the equivalent of a nurse's aide at Madrid's Carlos III hospital.

                    "body": "The first Ebola transmission case outside of Africa, involving a Spanish nurse who was treating an infected priest, has renewed concerns over the repatriation of those who become stricken with the deadly virus in West Africa.\n\nMajor questions remain as to how, exactly, the nurse contracted the disease after the Spanish priest was brought home from Sierra Leone for treatment. Health workers protested Tuesday as reports emerged that nurses in the unit had used tape to seal their latex gloves and that their protective suits weren't impermeable.\n\nIn the absence of answers, the case in Spain underscores the dangers of caring for Ebola patients, even in developed countries.\n\n\"We are taking this as an alert that we need to redouble our efforts to ensure U.S. healthcare facilities are ready to safely manage patients with Ebola,\" Abbigail Tumpey, spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said via e-mail on Tuesday.\n\nThe CDC, she noted, will host training sessions in Alabama this week to teach West Africa-bound health-care providers how to work safely in Ebola treatment wards.\n\nSo far, five Ebola-infected Americans have been brought back to the United States from West Africa in specially equipped \"air ambulances.\" Two remain hospitalized: One, who has not been identified, has been treated in an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital since Sept. 9, and another, an NBC News freelance cameraman, arrived at Nebraska Medical Center on Monday.\n\nA Norwegian doctor who became stricken with Ebola while working in Sierra Leone was medevaced to Norway on Tuesday, and a French nurse who contracted Ebola while volunteering with Doctors Without Borders was released from a French hospital over the weekend.\n\nAs opposed to the case in Dallas, where Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed after traveling from Liberia to the United States through Brussels, the repatriated patients are not people who showed up at U.S. or European emergency rooms unannounced, testing the ability of those facilities to identify a potential Ebola case.\n\nIn these cases, hospital officials and health-care workers were expecting Ebola patients, and, in theory, have been prepared to minimize the risk of transmission while caring for them.\n\nShelly Schwedhelm, nursing director of Nebraska Medical Center's bio-containment unit, said on Tuesday that she doesn't believe it's possible for a fate similar to the Spanish nurse's to befall one of her staff members or colleagues. \"There are always things that can happen, but I feel very comfortable and confident with the personnel and the procedures in the unit,\" she said.\n\nBut similar situations to the Spanish case are \"unavoidable\" and \"will happen also in the future, most likely,\" the World Health Organization's European regional director Zsuzsanna Jakab told Reuters.\n\n\"The unfortunate news that's going on in Spain, it can't help but increase some of that anxiety that's going on right now,\" David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said on a conference call with reporters Tuesday. Lakey emphasized that Texas medical personnel are being extremely careful in treating Duncan.\n\nAt the Nebraska facility, someone constantly monitors caregivers as they're putting on and removing protective gear, to ensure it's done properly and in the right order. Gear includes head covers, respirators, gowns, boots, \"triple gloves\" and visors. All waste from the bio-containment unit is run through a large medical sterilizer called an autoclave.\n\nThe Spanish case was briefly discussed in the Nebraska team's morning huddle Tuesday. But, Schwedhelm said: \"Honestly, they're eager to know what happened, but there are absolutely no concerns for themselves at the moment.\"\n\nThose working with the repatriated patients in Nebraska -- there are more than 40 of them on the team, Schwedhelm said -- volunteered for Ebola detail and went through an application process. Many staff members were \"eager to get back in the unit\" Monday when the center received its newest patient, NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo. The facility's first Ebola patient, missionary doctor Richard Sacra, was discharged late last month.\n\nThere are far more West African medical and aid workers than foreign nationals treating Ebola patients on the front lines of the outbreak; Doctors Without Borders alone has about 3,000 in the region, compared to about 250 foreign nationals.\n\nBut, public health officials say, allowing for the possibility of repatriation in the event of an infection is a critical recruitment tool as global aid organizations struggle to enlist foreign health-care workers and volunteers.\n\n\"We still need to continue the measures for evacuation of staff because we recognize that there's an extraordinary burden carried by health workers and doctors working on Ebola,\" WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said. \"They're at the forefront of fighting [the disease].\"\n\nThe United States could see more American patients brought back home; if any U.S. service members contract Ebola during the military's operation in West Africa, they will be brought back to the United States for treatment, Gen. David Rodriguez, the chief of U.S. Africa Command, said Tuesday.\n\nA few voices have come out against bringing Ebola-infected Americans back for treatment. Among those critical of the repatriation of infected aid workers: Donald Trump and Ben Carson. But the public outcry here has been limited.\n\nIn contrast, there was widespread controversy in Spain when that nation repatriated a priest from West Africa to the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, with health-care workers saying the country was ill-equipped to treat him.\n\nDaniel Bernab\u00e9u, the president of Spain's doctors' trade union, called the move \"political rather than health-related,\" the Guardian reported at the time. He also pointed out that Spain had just one hospital with adequate bio-safety measures -- and that even there, the safety measures lagged behind those found in numerous U.S. hospitals.\n\nIn August, after the first repatriated American Ebola patients were discharged in Atlanta, Bruce Ribner, medical director of Emory's Infectious Disease Unit, said: \"We were very hopeful that with the level of support we can deliver in our facility, that we would have a substantially better outcome than our colleagues practicing with lesser developed health care systems.\"\n\nRibner, who led the team that treated doctor Kent Brantly and missionary worker Nancy Writebol, noted that the lessons learned in caring for those two patients would \"help advance the world's understanding of how to treat Ebola virus infections, and hopefully to improve survival in parts of the world where patients with this infection are treated.\"\n\nAnd, he declared: \"It was the right decision to bring these patients back to Emory for treatment.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, in Omaha, Nebraska Medical Center's Schwedhelm said she felt similarly about treating Sacra and, now, Mukpo.\n\n\"These are Americans and we want to be able to provide them with the best care possible,\" she said. \"I feel very confident, and in doing that, we're fulfilling our role and responsibility. That's what I trained for.\"\u200b\n\nMark Berman contributed to this report.\n\nRELATED READING:\n\n[Post Exclusive: How the world failed to stop the Ebola epidemic]\n\nDallas patient: I would have preferred to die in Liberia rather than expose fianc\u00e9e to Ebola\n\nU.S. will increase Ebola screenings, but won't impose travel bans\n\nHere's what the Ebola epidemic (still) looks like in West Africa\n\nLive chat with Post reporters and Ebola experts.

                    "body": "Despite rigorous checks and protocols, a nursing assistant in Madrid still contracted the disease from a sick patient\n\nWhen two Spanish missionaries working in Sierra Leone contracted Ebola and were evacuated to Madrid's Carlos III hospital, city officials and the country's health minister assured a nervous public that the hospital's strict protocols would prevent transmission of the virus to health workers and other patients.\n\nBut something went wrong. A 40-year-old nursing assistant has become the first person to contract the disease outside of Africa after helping care for one of the missionaries, Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, before his death on Sept. 25. The nurse, who has not been named by the hospital, was infected despite being fully outfitted with two layers of protective gear on the two occasions she helped treat him. She also reported to the hospital that she was suffering from a fever a full week before she was admitted to a highly secure isolation ward early Tuesday morning. At this point no one knows exactly where a mistake was made. But the fact that the hospital's rigorous checks couldn't prevent the nursing assistant from becoming sick raises the question: is Europe less prepared for Ebola than it thinks?\n\n\"It came as a true surprise, and a stunning one,\" says M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez Jurado, president of the General Nursing Council (CGE), which represents Spain's nurses. \"We thought we were well prepared, and that the risk -- even if it can't be zero -- was minimal. After all, we have very good, very modern health care. Spain has the seventh best health care system in the world.\"\n\nAt Hospital Carlos III, the 30 health workers who had contact with the infected missionaries donned double layers of head-to-toe protective gear each time they entered the isolation room where the patients were housed. They were also required to take their own temperatures twice daily during the 21-day incubation period for the disease. It was through that protocol that the infected nurse first reported on Sept. 30th that she had a temperature of 38.6 C (101.5 F).\n\nFor reasons that are still unclear -- possibly because the fever was relatively low, but perhaps because in its early stages, Ebola's viral count can be too low for detection -- the disease was ruled out. Like Thomas Eric Duncan, the visiting Liberian who presented himself at a Dallas hospital on Sept. 25, the nurse was sent home. On vacation from work, she stayed there until an ordinary ambulance brought her to her neighborhood hospital on Oct. 6 with a fever that was by then raging.\n\n\"It would have been better if she had entered the hospital on the 30th,\" Fernando Sim\u00f3n, emergencies coordinator for the Health Ministry, admitted to the press. But that possible mistake is not the only one under scrutiny. In August, a male nurse at Hospital La Paz, which is affiliated with Carlos III, wrote an anonymous post for the blog of the Madrid Association of Independent Nursing, in which he complained that the staff was not sufficiently trained in Ebola protocols, and that it had not performed any simulations of Ebola treatment by the time the two missionaries arrived.\n\nIt's a complaint repeated by Gonz\u00e1lez, the nursing council's president. \"In the case of avian influenza A, the government formed a crisis cabinet, there was exhaustive information available to the public and complete training for health professionals,\" he said. \"That was not the case with Ebola. According to the information we have, the staff were not receiving the kind of in-depth training they should have.\" Those who cared for the two missionaries were not isolated, a protocol that has since changed with the nurse's case.\n\n\"We don't do many simulations in Spain, and we need to, we need to professionalize this more,\" says Dr. Antoni Trilla, epidemiologist at the Hospital Clinic of the University of Barcelona. \"It's only through achieving real verisimilitude that you discover the flaws in your protocols.\" He should know: his hospital has had two Ebola scares, both of which turned out to be negative. But the cases enabled the hospital to improve, for example, its procedure for one of the most dangerous moments of care: removing protective gear after contact with the infected.\n\nBut even improved training has its limits, especially for a disease so highly infectious as Ebola. \"What we know from the situation of healthcare workers in west Africa is that it is sometimes actually people who appear to have taken all the precautions that fall ill,\" says David Moore, Professor of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\"They may have dropped their guard when removing protective gear or in disposing of a dead body. In west Africa, they learnt that lesson the painful way.\"\n\nCaregivers in Europe are likely to learn that lesson too. \"It's unavoidable that there will be other cases like this,\" says Zsuzsanna Jakab, European regional director for the World Health Organization. \"But Europe -- and especially the European Union -- is well prepared. I would even say it's the best prepared region.\"\n\nIt may need to be. So long as air travel continues to and from the three countries in west Africa worst affected by the disease, the risk of further outbreaks remains high. With nearly 30% of the air passengers leaving Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone flying to Europe, the risk of more cases appearing in Europe is real -- and growing. A study published in the scientific journal PLoS on Oct. 6 put the risk of Ebola being imported to France by October 24 at 75% and to the UK at 50%. The results were based on levels of air traffic.\n\nIt's healthcare workers like the Spanish nursing assistant who will likely be worst affected. The unnamed woman was in a stable condition as of Tuesday evening, and is receiving immunotherapy in the form of a serum made from the blood of an Ebola patient who recovered. Three people, including the nurse's husband, have now been placed in quarantine, with medical staff who treated her under observation, and contact tracing of friends and family. But even if she remains an isolated case, others are sure to follow. \"We're never going to see this become an epidemic among the general public in Europe,\" says Dr. Trilla. \"But there is definitely a risk for medical personnel. They're the ones I worry about.\"\n\nWith reporting by Naina Bajekal / London",

That is an argument for fighting Ebola as hard as possible, right now. Fight it there, or we will eventually have to fight it here.\"\n\nDr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: \"UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated.\"\n\nInternational Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review following the Spanish case of Ebola.\n\n\"It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK,\" she said. \"But what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where it's spreading so rapidly now.\"\n\nArmy personnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to send a humanitarian operation to west Africa within the next few weeks.\n\nThey will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease.\n\nMinister for the Armed Forces, Mark Francois, said: \"The Ebola virus represents a global threat to public health and we will not stand idly by.\"\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"As part of the Government's ongoing efforts to combat the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, the Prime Minister will chair this week's Cobr meeting. This is part of an ongoing series of Cobr meetings to coordinate the UK response that started in late July and has been in the diary for some time.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Cameron last night called the President of Sierra Leone to be updated on their situation, and discussed the use of \u00a3125m UK aid, including support for 700 extra beds.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"We are aware of the situation in Spain and are monitoring it closely.\n\n\"This is a reminder that we must support healthcare workers in maintaining the most rigorous infection control procedures when dealing with Ebola.

This is part of an ongoing series of Cobr meetings to coordinate the UK response that started in late July and has been in the diary for some time.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Cameron called the President of Sierra Leone to be updated on their situation, and discussed the use of \u00a3125m UK aid, including support for 700 extra beds.\n\nMinisters announced plans to send more than 100 army medics to Sierra Leone to help tackle the crisis and treat medics with the disease.\n\nLatest forecasts from US scientists warn of a 50 per cent chance that the virus could reach British shores within three weeks.\n\nUniversities and schools have also been sent advice warning them to look out for pupils showing signs of fever who have travelled from West Africa.\n\nThe unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in Africa, and become an increasing concern across the rest of the world.\n\nEarlier this week President Barack Obama indicated that the US now plans to screen incoming air passengers for the virus.\n\nBut Public Health England (PHE) said it does not intend to introduce screening for travellers from West Africa, insisting such efforts would be impractical, and mean checks on \"huge numbers of low-risk people\".\n\nOfficials said if a case of Ebola was reported in the UK, the affected person would be isolated and protective measures would be implemented.\n\nPHE said the overall chance of the virus entering Britain remained \"low\" and the country has \"robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases\".\n\nHowever officials described a \"real risk\" the disease could reach British shores, while British virologists said the arrival of the virus now appeared \"inevitable\".\n\nOn Tuesday the European Commission launched an investigation into the actions of the Spanish authorities, and why it was that the Spanish nurse, treating repatriated Ebola patients, was not diagnosed and placed in isolation until a week after she began feeling unwell.\n\nThe Spanish nurse, 44, contracted the virus after helping to treat two repatriated priests who both died.\n\nShe reportedly contacted doctors to say she was suffering from a fever and fatigue on September 30, but did not present herself to her local hospital for more than one week.\n\nInternational Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review following the Spanish case of Ebola.\n\n\"It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK,\" she said. \"But what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where it's spreading so rapidly now.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"We are aware of the situation in Spain and are monitoring it closely.\n\n\"This is a reminder that we must support healthcare workers in maintaining the most rigorous infection control procedures when dealing with Ebola. The NHS has tried and tested systems for managing infectious diseases, and we continue to inform clinicians about the signs of Ebola, the need for vigilance and the action to take if they have cause for concern about a particular patient.\"\n\nOn Tuesday Boris Johnson has said he is growing increasingly concerned that Ebola will arrive in Britain. The London Mayor said that his 'alarm levels' were rising and he would be investigating what could be done to stall the disease.\n\nSpeaking on LBC Radio to Nick Ferrari he said: \"One's concern does start to rise Nick. I won't hide it from you and I won't hide it from listeners.\n\n\"I will be seeking further information about what exactly we are going to be doing because it is clear that the thing is very, very contagious and lethal.\n\n\"My alarm levels, I won't hide it from you, my alarm levels about this are rising.\"\n\nArmy personnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to send a humanitarian operation to west Africa within the next few weeks.\n\nThey will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease.\n\nThey will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease, not members of the general public, and will operate a 12-bed facility.\n\nThe medics have been undergoing an extensive training exercise in full protective suits, with simulated casualties in make-up, at Strensall Barracks, York. The exercise which is expected to last two weeks has been running for 13 hours every day.\n\nCasualties with symptoms or suspicion of the Ebola virus, complete with realistic make-up and prosthetic veins, present themselves to the teams who are dressed in full protective plastic suits and face masks.\n\nMinister for the Armed Forces, Mark Francois, said: \"The Ebola virus represents a global threat to public health and we will not stand idly by.\n\n\"This UK has been at the forefront of responding to the epidemic and our medics will continue the great work already carried out by the military engineers, planners, DfID and FCO representatives and NGOs.\n\n\"This operation will involve a unique set of challenges but I believe that our military medics, who we are extremely proud of, have the ability to provide support to the World Health Organisation in helping to bring the outbreak under control.\"\n\nThe unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, and become an escalating concern to the rest of the world.\n\nBritish nurse William Pooley, who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, survived after he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.\n\nInternational Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review, following the case in Spain.\n\nShe told BBC News: \"It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK.\n\n\"But what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where it's spreading so rapidly now.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"We are aware of the situation in Spain and are monitoring it closely.\n\n\"This is a reminder that we must support healthcare workers in maintaining the most rigorous infection control procedures when dealing with Ebola.

Furthermore, *22 more possible Ebola cases are under surveillance* having had direct contact with the infected nurse during her vacation after being infected (officials have said they 'don't know' how she became infected with the deadly virus). Images within the hospital show \"irregularities\" and make-shift isolation units and an insider account said \"I do not want to create social alarm, but explain what is still a reality everyday for a few months of nursing staff at the ICU.\". One researcher noted* \"air traffic is the driver.,\" and added ominously, \"it's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky.\"*\n\nAs RT reports,\n\n*Health officials in Madrid say three more people are in the hospital on suspicion of contracting Ebola.* The news comes a day after a nurse who treated two Ebola patients at a city hospital became infected with the disease.\n\nThe nurse is now being treated with a drip using antibodies from those previously infected with the virus, Reuters reports.* Approximately 22 contacts of the woman, often referred to as the 'Spanish Ebola nurse,' have been identified and are being monitored, Madrid health officials told a press conference on Tuesday.*\n\nThe officials added that the hospitalized include the nurse's husband, another health worker and a traveler who had spent time in one of he affected West African countries.\n\n*Spanish authorities are struggling to explain the infection, *as The Daily Mail reports\n\n*\"At the moment we are investigating the way in which the professional was infected,\" *said Antonio Alemany, the head of Madrid's primary health care services.\n\n*\"We don't know yet what failed,\"* he was quoted by the Guardian as saying. \"We're investigating the mechanism of infection.\"\n\nMercedes Vinuesa, the head of Spain's public health service, told parliament today that the nurse's husband had been placed in quarantine.\n\nAnd, as RT reports, in a similar vein to Dallas, it appears local hospitals were anything but prepared for this...\n\n*Spanish authorities have come under increasing pressure to explain how the disease was able to spread in their hopital. *While they say all proper protocols and procedure were followed while providing care to the deceased missionaries, reports to the contrary have surfaced.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, staff at the hospital said waste from the rooms of both patients had been carried out in the same elevator used by all personnel. The hospital was also reportedly not evacuated when the second patient, Garc\u00eda Viejo, was taken in to receive treatment.\n\n*Union workers also accused the government of providing hospital staff with adequate hazmat-suits.*\n\nSome Spanish medical-worker representatives said the situation should prompt an overhaul of the procedures and facilities used to treat those afflicted with the virus.\n\n*\"Something went wrong,\" M\u00e1ximo Gonzalez Jurado, head of Spain's General Nursing Council, told Spanish news agency EFE. \"They need to establish if the protocol is correct or not correct so that a case like this, that never should have happened, doesn't happen again.\"*\n\n* * *\n\n*\"Air traffic is the driver,\" *warns Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston...predicting where the virus will spread...\n\nThere is a* 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted.*\n\nUsing Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world.\n\n*They estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24.*\n\nAnd Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each.\n\n*'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky.\"*\n\n* * *\n\nAn insider whistle-blows on the weakness in Spanish anti-Ebola protocls (via Google Translate)\n\n*I am a nurse in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Hospital La Paz.

You can't overprotect,\" Peter Piot said after tests confirmed a 40-year-old nurse at a Madrid hospital had become the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa.\n\n\"Dealing with patients with Ebola .. is very risky business, and the slightest mistake can be fatal,\" said the Belgian scientist who co-discovered the Ebola virus in 1976.\n\n\"It's better to be accused of overreacting than to not take all the measures,\" he told reporters in Geneva.\n\nPiot was in the Swiss city to head a World Health Organization-hosted expert review of the science behind the global response to the ongoing outbreak -- by far the deadliest on record.\n\nFollowing the teleconference with 15 experts from around the world, he said he was \"not surprised\" that a nurse had been infected in a European hospital despite the best efforts to avoid transmission.\n\nThe infected nurse cared for two elderly Spanish missionaries who died from the virus after being flown home from west Africa, sparking questions about how safety procedures were applied.\n\nNews of her infection also sparked renewed questions about Madrid's decision to repatriate infected missionaries from Africa. Critics said Spanish hospitals were not equipped to deal with Ebola.\n\nPiot, a professor at the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, agreed it was risky to \"import someone with Ebola\" to a place with no experience of the virus or with using the protective equipment.\n\nHe noted that even two doctors with the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) charity had been infected, despite \"draconian discipline\".\n\n\"A dangerous moment is when you undress. When you come out of the isolation unit, you take off your protective gear and you're full of sweat, and you may take off your glasses and do like this,\" he explained, rubbing his eye.\n\n\"And that would be the end.\"\n\nTo ensure the safety of people working with Ebola patients, Piot stressed the need for very strict discipline, with basically \"police\" watching over them as they undress, making sure they make no missteps.\n\n\"That discipline is necessary. That's illustrated by the nurse in Madrid,\" he said.\n\nBut while Ebola poses a threat to health care workers around the world, Piot said there was \"no risk that I see for outbreaks\" in developed countries like the one that has killed 3,439 people in west Africa, according to the latest WHO toll.\n\nHe warned that the few cases surfacing in Europe and the United States should not remove the focus from the most affected countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\n\"The only way to prevent the popping up of Ebola patients and maybe even outbreaks (elsewhere in the world) is to bring the epidemic under control in west Africa,\" he said.",

It is unlikely but not \u00adimpossible that people infected in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia could arrive in the UK while \u00adincubating the disease and develop symptoms after their return.\"\n\nIn a section entitled Implications for the UK she urged \"every clinician in England\" to take a full travel history from all patients with a fever.\n\nProf Davies' five-page warning - issued via the NHS Central Alerting System and seen by the Mirror - came as David Cameron ordered an \u00ademergency Cobra meeting on how to deal with a deadly spread here.\n\nPublic Health England also announced Ebola medical advice had been sent to immigration centres, universities and schools. The body's director of global health Dr Brian McCloskey insisted \"plans were in place\" to deal with any outbreak.\n\nHe added: \"Our robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases are active permanently, and always available and regularly tested and proven to be effective. The overall risk of Ebola to the UK remains low.\" But Prof Davies warned UK aid workers in West Africa now face a bigger chance of catching the disease which has killed more than 3,400 people in the region and infected around 7,500.\n\nMore than 6,000 people a week arrive in Britain on around 40 flights from Nigeria, Ghana and The Gambia which lie near the affected areas and are major transport hubs.\n\nBut PHE ruled out introducing Ebola screening for passengers - as the US plan to do. It said the World Health Organization does not recommend the move and it would mean screening \"huge numbers of low-risk people\".\n\nEbola victims are not \u00adinfectious until they display symptoms - which include high fever, bleeding and central nervous system damage.\n\nInternational Development Secretary Justine Greening yesterday said the Government will continue to keep travel tighter restrictions under review.\n\nBritish Airways has suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Earlier this week scientists calculated the odds of the virus spreading to Europe, based on flight patterns and said there was a 50-50 chance of it hitting Britain.\n\nStudy author Dr Derek Gatherer, of Lancaster University, said: \"If this continues to rage on in West Africa and gets worse, then it's only a matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to Europe.\"\n\nMr Cameron yesterday spoke to Sierra Leone \u00adpresident Ernest Koroma. Downing Street said: \"They discussed how the \u00a3125million in UK aid was helping efforts. The \u00adpresident said the situation was very serious and they need to train more medical staff and improve the burial process.\"\n\nWhat is Ebola and how does it spread?\n\nA Norwegian aid worker contracted the disease in Sierra Leone and is being treated in Oslo. Around 1,200 Germans are preparing to fly to West Africa along with troops to help with the crisis after answering a call for volunteers.\n\nFury was last night growing in Spain after nurse Teresa Romero Ramos contracted Ebola. She had treated two Spanish priests who later died of the disease after being flown home from Africa. The EC has asked medical chiefs to explain how she became infected. Officials were racing to trace up to 30 staff who had been in contact with Teresa and patients they have treated.\n\nMedics claimed protective suits given to them and Teresa were substandard and may not have stopped the virus, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids. Hospital workers held protests over the apparent lack of standards.\n\nThe victim was yesterday moved under police escort to Carlos III hospital in Madrid. She was said to be stable.\n\nHer husband Javier Limon Romero and two others were in quarantine. He last night claimed health chiefs want to put down their dog Excalibur because of its contact with him and his wife.\n\nBack in Britain, a little boy from Sierra Leone has been banned from a school after parents feared their children would be infected by Ebola.\n\nKofi Mason-Sesay, nine, was due to start St Simon's Catholic primary in Stockport, Gtr Manchester, for an annual placement as his British mum Miriam , 48, carries out charity work in Africa.\n\nHealth officials insisted he carried no risk. But Miriam said: \"There was so much pressure from an ignorant parent body that the school had to act.\"\n\nPoll loading ...",

                    "body": "PARIS: The first home-grown European case of Ebola, in a Spanish nurse, was avoidable, virologists said Tuesday (Oct 7) as the EU demanded answers from Madrid.\n\nThough there is always a threat to health workers of infection with the virus spread through contact with body fluids, the risk is small and well-understood and existing protections effective, the specialists said.\n\n\"If appropriate containment measures were adopted this really should not have happened,\" said Jonathan Ball, a virology professor at the University of Notthingham. \"It will be crucial to find out what went wrong in this case so necessary measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nThe Spanish government said Monday that a nurse had contracted the haemorrhagic fever after treating two patients who died at a Madrid hospital - both missionaries infected in West Africa, where Ebola has claimed more than 3,400 lives. The 40-year-old woman is in a stable condition.\n\nThe European Union on Tuesday demanded an explanation from Spain as to how she could have become infected. In comments to Britain's Science Media Centre, experts said protective suits worn by health workers, coupled with safe disposal of patients' bodily waste, substantially reduced the risk.\n\n\"The recent report of a Spanish nurse who has contracted the virus... is of concern as it suggests that the barrier methods and training were not sufficient to protect healthcare workers and prevent secondary infection,\" said virology professor David Evans of the University of Warwick.\n\nWASTE DISPOSAL KEY\n\nBen Neuman, an expert from the University of Reading, said investigators will have to look closely at the disposal of waste at the hospital where she worked.\n\n\"Nurses face a problem in that a person who is sick with Ebola can make quite a lot of highly infectious waste, as the patient loses fluid through diarrhoea and vomiting. Those bodily fluids can contain millions of Ebola viruses, and it only takes one to transfer the infection.\"\n\nAnother concern was that the nurse had gone on holiday the day after the second patient died on Sep 25, though authorities have not said where she went.\n\nAfter contracting the virus, it takes up to 21 days for a person to develop symptoms, which is when they become infectious. \"Reality is that anyone who suspects that they have been exposed to the virus, unless they were properly protected from infection, should not travel until this 21-day incubation period has passed,\" said Ball.\n\nThe case underlined the importance of following protection measures to a tee, the experts said. But there was always a risk, however small. A tiny amount of Ebola-containing liquid could splash on protective garments and be transferred to a person's skin, for example.\n\n\"As the African outbreak perfectly illustrates, healthcare workers put their life on the line, so everything should be done to ensure that risks are minimised as much as possible,\" said Ball.\n\nIt was also a reminder that the risk of such sporadic exports will increase as more and more people become infected in West Africa. \"That is why it is so important for the international community to ramp up their efforts to combat this deadly disease,\" Ball said.",

This would require the UK to screen every returning traveller, as people could return to the UK from an affected country through any port of entry. This would be huge numbers of low-risk people.\n\n\"PHE has provided UK Border Force with advice on the assessment of an unwell patient on entry to UK.\"\n\nDr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: \"UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases. If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated.\"\n\nPersonnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to sent on their humanitarian operation to west Africa within the next few weeks.\n\nThey will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease, not members of the general public, and will operate a 12-bed facility.\n\nThe medics have been undergoing an extensive training exercise in full protective suits, with simulated casualties in make-up, at Strensall Barracks, York. The exercise which is expected to last two weeks has been running for 13 hours every day.\n\nCasualties with symptoms or suspicion of the Ebola virus, complete with realistic make-up and prosthetic veins, present themselves to the teams who are dressed in full protective plastic suits and face masks.\n\nAn Army spokeswoman said: \"They are going through all their procedures and getting atuned to wearing their personal protective equipment, working in quite hot temperatures.\n\n\"The training centre, which was geared up to be a replica of Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, can vary the temperature and it is warm in there today.\n\n\"The casualties come in and the medics test their procedures and working through using their protective equipment.\"\n\nThe unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, and become an escalating concern to the rest of the world.\n\nBritish nurse William Pooley, who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, survived after he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.\n\nInternational Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review after a Spanish nurse contracted Ebola, and three others were placed under quarantine, at a Madrid hospital.\n\nShe told BBC News: \"It doesn't change the assessment of the risk to the UK.\n\n\"But what it does show is why we're right to be working with governments as we are in Sierra Leone to help them combat this disease where it's spreading so rapidly now.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of PHE said the UK was well prepared should any further cases of Ebola enter the country.\n\nProfessor David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, urged health workers to be \"suspicious\" of any signs of fever from people who have visited the region.\n\n\"The UK has already had a case and illustrated it has excellent protection for health workers,\" Prof Heymann said.\n\n\"The UK has what is necessary in place. The best advice for health workers is always be prepared.\n\n\"You should expect a case anywhere in the world and you should be prepared.\n\n\"Trying to set up border controls is not the answer. It's a false security.\n\n\"For health workers, they should be suspicious if someone has a fever or the early signs of Ebola and has just returned from West Africa.\"\n\nProf Heymann said the suggestion that Ebola could become airborne was \"irresponsible\" because no virus transmitted by bodily fluids had ever mutated to airborne transmission.\n\nIt follows comments from Anthony Banbury, the chief of the UN's Ebola mission, who told the Telegraph there was a \"nightmare\" chance that Ebola could become airborne if the epidemic is not brought under control fast enough.\n\nArmed Forces minister Mark Francois visited the exercise and said afterwards the aim was to reassure foreign health professionals that they could volunteer to fight ebola knowing they would receive excellent treatment if they contracted the virus.\n\nHe said: \"The critical point is to have a world class medical facility available in Sierra Leone that can give other medical workers from around the world comfort, that if they were to become infected, they could go there and get the best medical treatment that we can provide.\"\n\nThe aim was for Save the Children to run the facility once it was functioning well, he said.\n\nLt Col Alison McCourt, the unit's commanding officer, said the operation would be challenging, especially following the news from Spain that a nurse had contracted ebola.\n\n\"It would be wrong for me to comment on that,\" she said. \"What I can say is that the training that my personnel are receiving and the personal protective equipment that we will be using minimises that risk as far as practically possible.\n\n\"Our staff will know the dangers that they face, they will have been specifically trained to face those dangers whereas it is possible that other health care workers just working in routine departments within a hospital may not have had that equipment available to them.\"\n\nPrivate Kate Owen, a combat medic, said the experience of donning her protective suit and working in hot conditions had been \"really beneficial\".\n\nShe said: \"The conditions are going to be quite arduous, but being in the Army, we are quite used to adapting to our environment.\"",

                    "body": "By Ronald R. Cherry\n\nA Spanish nurse has contracted Ebola - in Spain - while caring for a Spanish Priest who became infected with Ebola in West Africa. The Priest died of Ebola, so let's pray that his nurse survives.\n\n\"A nursing auxiliary in Madrid has tested positive for Ebola after treating a patient in the Spanish capital, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais. The case is believed to be first in which a person contracts Ebola from a source outside of Africa. While the woman has not been identified, El Pais reports that she is 44 years old, married without children, and originally from Galicia, though she has worked for more than 15 years in Carlos III Hospital in Madrid. She has not left Spain or come in contact with the Ebola virus except for her work in treating Manual Garc\u00eda Viejo... The newspaper notes that the nurse brought herself to Alcorc\u00f3n hospital's emergency room after experiencing a fever, and was tested twice for Ebola, both times with positive results. Co-workers tell El Pais they are shocked by the contamination, given that the hospital used \"extreme\" protection against the disease.\"\n\nThe Spanish nurse likely became infected with Ebola via airborne transmission. No doubt she had extreme protection against direct contact with the body and body fluids of the Ebola patient, but that is not good enough.\n\n\"Being at first skeptical that Ebola virus could be an aerosol-transmissible disease, we are now persuaded by a review of experimental and epidemiologic data that this might be an important feature of disease transmission, particularly in healthcare settings... We believe there is scientific and epidemiologic evidence that Ebola virus has the potential to be transmitted via infectious aerosol particles both near and at a distance from infected patients, which means that healthcare workers should be wearing respirators, not facemasks... We strongly urge the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to seek funds for the purchase and transport of PAPRs [powered air-purifying respirators] to all healthcare workers currently fighting the battle against Ebola throughout Africa - and beyond.\"\n\nAirborne transmission of Ebola probably accounts for this case and others, such as Dr. Kent Brantly, who also exercised extreme caution - but not enough caution - he did not use a HEPA-filtered full face respirator. Under CDC guidelines healthcare workers are protected against direct contact but not against inhalation or eye exposure to microscopic contaminated droplet nuclei, which cannot be seen and which can travel across a room with air currents, and which can remain infectious for about an hour and a half.\n\n\"The potential for transmission via inhalation of aerosols, therefore, cannot be ruled out by the observed risk factors or our knowledge of the infection process. Many body fluids, such as vomit, diarrhea, blood, and saliva, are capable of creating inhalable aerosol particles in the immediate vicinity of an infected person. Cough was identified among some cases in a 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and coughs are known to emit viruses in respirable particles. The act of vomiting produces an aerosol and has been implicated in airborne transmission of gastrointestinal viruses. Regarding diarrhea, even when contained by toilets, toilet flushing emits a pathogen-laden aerosol that disperses in the air... Aerosolized (1-3 mcm) Marburg, Ebola, and Reston viruses, at 50% to 55% relative humidity and 72\u00b0F, had biological decay rates of 3.04%, 3.06%. and 1.55% per minute, respectively. These rates indicate that 99% loss in aerosol infectivity would occur in 93, 104, and 162 minutes, respectively.\"\n\nIf, as the CDC asserts, Ebola is not transmitted through the air by microscopic droplet nuclei, then why do U.S. Government and American academic researchers take care to handle the Ebola virus only in BL4 biocontainment facilities while the rest of us are left to struggle against Ebola at the local hospital? The potential for this strain of Ebola is exponential, and we have 300 million unvaccinated sitting ducks - we Americans. Our government has failed in its primary duty - to defend and protect the American people. I believe our pharmaceutical companies would have developed Ebola vaccines years ago were it not for Big Brother.\n\n\u00a9 Ronald R. Cherry",

                    "body": "In August, the first European infected with the Ebola virus in Western Africa was repatriated to Spain, a missionary who had lived for many years in Liberia. It was a medical-military operation following high security protocols. He was 75.\n\nThey took Miguel Pajares to Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz air force base near Madrid, and cleared the whole sixth floor of the Carlos III hospital to treat him and put him on the experimental drug ZMapp. But all those resources couldn't save him. He died on the 12th of August.\n\nAnother missionary, Manuel Garcia Viejo, died on the 25th of September, at the same Madrid hospital, after the 69-year-old had been repatriated from Sierra Leone with Ebola. A team of 30 health professional volunteers worked to save the two patients.\n\nThey took great precautions but not enough. Eleven days after Garcia Viejo's death, Monday, the Spanish Health Minister Ana Mato called the media.\n\nMato said: \"This evening we identified a case of transmission of the Ebola virus from a patient in our country. We are coodinating our best efforts for the patient, and to guarantee the security of all our citizens.\"\n\nIt was one of the volunteers, a 40-year-old nurse's aide who helped clean the two missionaries. On the 30th of September she reported her temperature was at 38.6 degrees Celsius and she felt bad. But according to a Madrid regional health service official she was not sent to hospital because she lacked the clinical criteria. Then her fever got worse.\n\nIt was left for the public health chief to explain.\n\nDirector General of Public Health Mercedes Vinuesa said: \"We have to find how this professional was infected. We know she was in Manuel Garcia Viejo's room twice, once before his death, to change a diaper, and once afterwards to clean up. According to our information, she went in with full protective equipment.\"\n\nMany Spaniards want to know why the missionaries were brought back.\n\nOne woman interviewed outside the hospital said: \"I think it was harmful to bring them to Spain. Spaniards or not, they had lived abroad for 20-30 years. I think it would have been best to leave them where they were.\"\n\nWe spoke with Doctor Marciano S\u00e1nchez Bayle, a paediatrician, kidney specialist and spokesman for the Public Health Service Defence Federation, in Madrid.\n\nProducer Beatriz Beiras asked: \"In light of what's happened, was it an error to repatriate the two missionaries?\"\n\nMarciano S\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"The way I see it, yes, because a disease has been imported that didn't exist here before, and it was treated in a place that did not meet adequate security conditions, as we've seen.\"\n\neuronews: \"A health professional catching the Ebola virus in a Spanish hospital with the standing of Carlos III is surprising, both to ordinary people and the scientific community. What's your assessment?\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"I don't think it's that surprising because there has been an attempt to dismantle the Carlos III Hospital by the Madrid regional health community with the support of the Ministry of Health, and so today it's not what it used to be.\"\n\neuronews: \"What do you mean, 'dismantle'?\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"The whole section devoted to infectious illnesses has been closed. The professionals who worked there have been moved to other positions. The laboratory was closed, and so was the intensive care unit. It's just to say that, one way or another, its capacity to take care of illnesses with these characteristics has been most remarkably reduced.\"\n\neuronews: \"Members of the CSI/F public sector workers union told euronews that the maximum level 4 clothing required when treating the Ebola patients was not always used. Have you heard about these allegations?\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"Yes, there have been numerous complaints, in the sense that there was little information and training of health professionals involved in caring for the Ebola patients, and people also said that the means for guaranteeing protection were insufficient or not of the required quality.\"\n\neuronews: \"There have been lots of questions about the procedure followed for the nurse's aide from the time she first felt symptoms. For example, didn't they wait too long before isolating her?\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"Clearly, she should have been quarantined right away, and the fact she moved around freely in the city of Madrid for several days, while she was carrying the illness, that adds more risks. They have to be considered important.\"\n\neuronews: \"A lot of people don't know how the Ebola virus is spread. Can you tell us, briefly?\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"The virus is contagious only when there is direct contact with the bodily fluids of the sick, such as saliva, sweat, blood, urine and semen. Transmission cannot be airborne.\"\n\neuronews: \"How do you rate the Health Ministry's management of this crisis?\"\n\nS\u00e1nchez Bayle: \"I think what is happening is very serious. I think the people in charge should resign immediately. They should guarantee that sufficiently qualified and responsible people are given the job of handling the problem. That is not currently the case.\"",

El gobierno trata de contener un posible brote del virus sin alarmar a la poblaci\u00f3n y determinar qu\u00e9 fallo.\n\nLa paciente form\u00f3 parte del equipo m\u00e9dico que atendi\u00f3 a un sacerdote espa\u00f1ol que muri\u00f3 v\u00edctima del \u00e9bola en septiembre. La infecci\u00f3n es el primer caso documentado de contagio fuera de \u00c1frica occidental en el m\u00e1s reciente estallido del virus que ha costado la vida a unas 3.500 personas.\n\nEl caso ilustra los peligros que enfrenta el personal sanitario que atiende a pacientes infectados de \u00e9bola. Las autoridades admitieron el martes que la enfermera cambi\u00f3 el pa\u00f1al del sacerdote y recogi\u00f3 la habitaci\u00f3n tras su muerte. Pero dicen que se cumplieron todos los protocolos de seguridad y han abierto una investigaci\u00f3n para identificar el foco de contagio.\n\nSindicatos de enfermer\u00eda indicaron que la auxiliar era una t\u00e9cnico sanitaria cualificada con 14 a\u00f1os de experiencia. Decenas de profesionales exigieron la dimisi\u00f3n de la ministra de Sanidad, Ana Mato, por su gesti\u00f3n de la crisis en protestas convocadas a las puertas de los centros hospitalarios.\n\n\"Ha sido una desagradable sorpresa. No lo imagin\u00e1bamos\", dijo Rafael P\u00e9rez Santamarina, gerente del hospital Carlos III, donde est\u00e1 ingresada la enfermera. \"Estamos buscando cual ha sido la causa del contagio\".\n\nOtras tres personas se encuentran actualmente en aislamiento en el Carlos III, centro de referencia para el tratamiento de enfermedades infecciosas en la capital espa\u00f1ola. Una es el marido de la enfermera. Otra es una segunda enfermera que tambi\u00e9n atendi\u00f3 al religioso. Ninguno de los dos presenta s\u00edntomas de la enfermedad, pero se decidi\u00f3 ponerlos en cuarentena por precauci\u00f3n.\n\nEl tercero es un ingeniero espa\u00f1ol que regres\u00f3 recientemente de Nigeria y que result\u00f3 negativo en una primera prueba para \u00e9bola. Se est\u00e1 a la espera del contran\u00e1lisis para descartar la infecci\u00f3n.\n\nSanidad ha reconstruido los movimientos de la enfermera desde que present\u00f3 los primeros s\u00edntomas hace una semana para no dejar cabos sueltos. La mujer estaba de vacaciones, pero no lleg\u00f3 a salir de Madrid. El \u00e9bola s\u00f3lo se contagia cuando el infectado est\u00e1 sintom\u00e1tico y por contacto directo de fluidos.\n\nLas autoridades han puesto bajo supervisi\u00f3n m\u00e9dica a 22 personas, entre familiares directos y personal m\u00e9dico que asisti\u00f3 a la paciente. El equipo de 30 personas que particip\u00f3 en la atenci\u00f3n al misionero Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo est\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n bajo vigilancia.\n\nTodos ellos deben tomarse la temperatura dos veces al d\u00eda y reportar cualquier novedad importante en su estado de salud, desde fiebre hasta cualquier otro s\u00edntoma. Los pr\u00f3ximos 21 d\u00edas, considerados el periodo m\u00e1ximo de incubaci\u00f3n del virus, son claves para frenar el brote.\n\n\"Puede haber nuevos casos\", admiti\u00f3 Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Arribas, jefe de la Unidad de Infecciosas del Carlos III. \"Pero estas epidemias son contenibles con el aislamiento del paciente\".\n\nEl caso de la enfermera espa\u00f1ola ilustra los peligros a los que se enfrenta el personal sanitario, no s\u00f3lo en cl\u00ednicas mal equipadas de \u00c1frica, sino tambi\u00e9n en los m\u00e1s sofisticados centros m\u00e9dicos de Europa y Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan William Schaffner, experto en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de Vanderbilt.\n\n\"El mayor riesgo en todos los brotes lo corren los trabajadores sanitarios\", dijo.\n\nEn un estallido sin precedentes el brote de \u00e9bola registrado este a\u00f1o ha matado a m\u00e1s de 3.400 personas en \u00c1frica occidental, seg\u00fan estimaciones de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud, y plantea una creciente preocupaci\u00f3n para el resto del mundo.

Pero rehus\u00f3 facilitar un posible n\u00famero de afectados. La enfermera se encontraba de vacaciones desde hace dos semanas y empez\u00f3 a experimentar s\u00edntomas de fiebre leve hace seis d\u00edas.

Su marido y los m\u00e9dicos que la atendieron el domingo est\u00e1n bajo vigilancia m\u00e9dica.\n\n\"Se est\u00e1n tomando todas y cada una de las medidas necesarias para garantizar la mejor atenci\u00f3n a la paciente, as\u00ed como para garantizar la seguridad del personal sanitario que la atienda como de toda la poblaci\u00f3n\", dijo Mato en rueda de prensa.

El gobierno trata ahora de contener un posible brote del virus y decidi\u00f3 aislar a dos personas sospechosas de estar infectadas y poner bajo vigilancia m\u00e9dica a otras 50.\n\nLa determinaci\u00f3n por evitar el avance del virus llev\u00f3 el martes a las autoridades sanitarias a ordenar el sacrificio del perro mascota de la paciente infectada. Los pr\u00f3ximos 21 d\u00edas, considerados el periodo m\u00e1ximo de incubaci\u00f3n, son claves para frenar el virus.\n\nLa paciente form\u00f3 parte del equipo m\u00e9dico que atendi\u00f3 a un sacerdote espa\u00f1ol que muri\u00f3 v\u00edctima del \u00e9bola en septiembre. La infecci\u00f3n es el primer caso documentado de contagio fuera de \u00c1frica occidental en el m\u00e1s reciente estallido del virus que ha costado la vida a casi 3.500 personas.\n\nPara Europa, un problema que parec\u00eda lejano ha llegado a sus puertas y amenaza con franquearlas. El caso ilustra los peligros que enfrenta el personal sanitario que atiende a pacientes infectados de \u00e9bola.\n\nLas autoridades admitieron el martes que la enfermera cambi\u00f3 el pa\u00f1al del sacerdote y recogi\u00f3 la habitaci\u00f3n tras su muerte. Pero dicen que llevaba el traje biol\u00f3gico protector y han abierto una investigaci\u00f3n para identificar el foco de contagio.\n\nSindicatos de enfermer\u00eda indicaron que la auxiliar era una t\u00e9cnico sanitaria cualificada con 14 a\u00f1os de experiencia. Decenas de profesionales se concentraron exigiendo la ministra de Sanidad, Ana Mato, a la que culpan de la falta de equipamiento adecuado para lidiar con los casos sospechosos.\n\n\"Ha sido una desagradable sorpresa. No lo imagin\u00e1bamos\", dijo Rafael P\u00e9rez Santamarina, gerente del hospital Carlos III, donde est\u00e1 ingresada la enfermera. \"Estamos buscando cual ha sido la causa del contagio\".\n\nOtras dos personas se encuentran en aislamiento en el Carlos III, centro de referencia para el tratamiento de enfermedades infecciosas en la capital espa\u00f1ola. Una es el marido de la enfermera, que no presenta s\u00edntomas. Otra es un ingeniero espa\u00f1ol que regres\u00f3 recientemente de Nigeria y que result\u00f3 negativo en una primera prueba para \u00e9bola. Se est\u00e1 a la espera del contran\u00e1lisis para descartar la infecci\u00f3n\n\nUn tercer caso sospechoso, el de otra enfermera que tambi\u00e9n trat\u00f3 al misionero en septiembre, fue descartado a \u00faltima hora del martes tras arrojar un doble resultado negativo de \u00e9bola en sendas pruebas. La paciente recibir\u00e1 el alta en las pr\u00f3ximas horas.\n\nSanidad ha reconstruido los movimientos de la auxiliar de enfermer\u00eda infectada desde que present\u00f3 los primeros s\u00edntomas hace una semana para no dejar cabos sueltos. La mujer estaba de vacaciones, pero no lleg\u00f3 a salir de Madrid. El \u00e9bola s\u00f3lo se contagia cuando el infectado est\u00e1 sintom\u00e1tico y por contacto directo de fluidos.\n\nDe hecho, el perro mascota de la enfermera espa\u00f1ola ser\u00e1 sacrificado para evitar que transmita la enfermedad. Los responsables de Sanidad aseguraron que existe bibliograf\u00eda cient\u00edfica que confirma el hallazgo de perros con anticuerpos del virus \u00e9bola y un riesgo potencial de contagio.\n\nMadrid tuvo que pedir una orden judicial para matar al perro, llamado Excalibur, porque la enfermera y su marido, due\u00f1os del animal, no autorizaban su entrega, dijo el gobierno regional en un comunicado.\n\nEl sacrificio se producir\u00e1 mediante eutanasia y las medidas adecuadas para evitar el sufrimiento del perro. El cad\u00e1ver del animal ser\u00e1 incinerado.\n\nUn grupo de 22 personas, entre familiares directos y personal m\u00e9dico que asisti\u00f3 a la paciente, est\u00e1 bajo supervisi\u00f3n m\u00e9dica. El equipo de 30 personas que particip\u00f3 en la atenci\u00f3n al religioso Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo est\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n bajo vigilancia.\n\nTodos ellos deben tomarse la temperatura dos veces al d\u00eda y reportar cualquier novedad importante en su estado de salud, desde fiebre hasta cualquier otro s\u00edntoma.\n\n\"Puede haber nuevos casos\", admiti\u00f3 Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Arribas, jefe de la Unidad de Infecciosas del Carlos III. \"Pero estas epidemias son contenibles con el aislamiento del paciente\".\n\n\"Solo contagia el paciente sintom\u00e1tico que tiene fiebre, a diferencia de otras enfermedades como la gripe y el sarampi\u00f3n\", agreg\u00f3.\n\nArribas explic\u00f3 que la enfermera evoluciona de momento favorablemente. Est\u00e1 siendo tratada con suero de otra paciente que sobrevivi\u00f3 al \u00e9bola. Tambi\u00e9n explic\u00f3 que tienen a su disposici\u00f3n un antiviral llamado \"Favipiravir\". No existe un tratamiento para el \u00e9bola y todas las soluciones terap\u00e9uticas son experimentales o aplicadas a otros virus.\n\nEl caso de la enfermera espa\u00f1ola ilustra los peligros a los que se enfrenta el personal sanitario, no s\u00f3lo en cl\u00ednicas mal equipadas de \u00c1frica, sino tambi\u00e9n en los m\u00e1s sofisticados centros m\u00e9dicos de Europa y Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan William Schaffner, experto en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de Vanderbilt.\n\n\"El mayor riesgo en todos los brotes lo corren los trabajadores sanitarios\", dijo.\n\nEn un estallido sin precedentes el brote de \u00e9bola registrado este a\u00f1o ha matado a casi 3.500 personas en \u00c1frica occidental, seg\u00fan estimaciones de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud, y plantea una creciente preocupaci\u00f3n para el resto del mundo. En los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s afectados -Liberia, Guinea y Sierra Leona- han fallecido m\u00e1s de 370 trabajadores sanitarios.\n\nEn Estados Unidos, el video periodista Ashoka Mukpo, que se infect\u00f3 cuando trabajaba en Liberia, lleg\u00f3 al Centro M\u00e9dico de Nebraska en Omaha, donde se atendi\u00f3 a otro paciente de \u00e9bola.

Pruebas de laboratorio indican que tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda funcionar contra el \u00e9bola.\n\nTambi\u00e9n se han utilizado otros dos f\u00e1rmacos experimentales desarrollados espec\u00edficamente para el \u00e9bola, aunque no est\u00e1 claro si han tenido alg\u00fan efecto. El escaso suministro de ZMapp se acab\u00f3 tras su uso en unos pocos pacientes, aunque las autoridades dicen que deber\u00eda haber m\u00e1s disponible en los pr\u00f3ximos dos meses. Una segunda medicaci\u00f3n, TKM-Ebola de la farmac\u00e9utica Tekmira, se ha utilizado al menos en un paciente y se ha indicado que hay existencias limitadas.\n\nObama dijo que Estados Unidos \"trabajar\u00e1 en protocolos para hacer controles adicionales de pasajeros tanto en la fuente como aqu\u00ed en Estados Unidos\", aunque no dio detalles ni ofreci\u00f3 un calendario para nuevas medidas.",

Una enfermera que estuvo en contacto directo con uno de los dos religiosos espa\u00f1oles fallecidos por el virus tras su traslado desde \u00c1frica a Madrid, se ha contagiado de la enfermedad, confirmaron fuentes sanitarias espa\u00f1olas. Expertos y medios de prensa se preguntan esta ma\u00f1ana c\u00f3mo fue posible el contagio, si sobre el papel se observaron todos los protocolos y medidas de seguridad recomendados por la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS).\n\nExpertos consultados por medios espa\u00f1oles de prensa aseguran que el contagio de la enfermera s\u00f3lo se puede explicar por un \"fallo humano\" en la cadena de completo aislamiento que debe tener el paciente. El personal sanitario utiliza equipos y trajes especiales, por lo cual se especula con un posible contacto de la enfermera con restos biol\u00f3gicos (heces, por ejemplo) del religioso fallecido.\n\nSe trata del primer caso de contagio de \u00e9bola fuera de \u00c1frica, y del segundo diagn\u00f3stico fuera de ese continente, tras el caso del liberiano que viaj\u00f3 a Estados Unidos ya infectado. La enfermera forma parte del equipo de 30 sanitarios espa\u00f1oles que atendieron a los dos religiosos espa\u00f1oles fallecidos por el virus en el hospital La Paz-Carlos III de Madrid.\n\nLa afectada, de 40 a\u00f1os y cuyo nombre no ha sido divulgado, trabaja habitualmente en el hospital La Paz-Carlos III donde tuvo contacto con el religioso Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, de 69 a\u00f1os, quien dirig\u00eda el Hospital San Juan de Dios en Lunsar, Sierra Leona, donde contrajo la enfermedad. El religioso falleci\u00f3 el pasado 26 de septiembre en Madrid, tras ser repatriado a Espa\u00f1a en un avi\u00f3n militar especialmente preparado.\n\nLa auxiliar de enfermer\u00eda acudi\u00f3 por propia iniciativa ayer, lunes, al servicio de urgencias del Hospital Universitario Fundaci\u00f3n Alcorc\u00f3n, en la periferia de Madrid, tras presentar un cuadro de fiebre alta, y sospechar un posible contagio. En estos momentos, seg\u00fan fuentes sanitarias, se encuentra \"estable\".\n\nPara tratar mejor su caso fue trasladada la pasada madrugada al Hospital La Paz-Carlos III, donde tambi\u00e9n fueron ingresados los dos misioneros espa\u00f1oles v\u00edctimas mortales del virus: Garc\u00eda Viejo y Miguel Pajares, el religioso fallecido el pasado agosto tras ser repatriado en un avi\u00f3n desde Liberia, el pa\u00eds de \u00c1frica occidental m\u00e1s afectado por el \u00e9bola, junto a Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal y Sierra Leona.\n\nSeg\u00fan los \u00faltimos datos de la OMS (a 1 de octubre), la epidemia de \u00e9bola en \u00c1frica se ha cobrado la vida de 3.338 personas, y la cifra de contagiados se eleva a 7.178. Estos datos reflejan una reducci\u00f3n en el n\u00famero total de nuevos casos, una tendencia que se repite por segunda semana consecutiva.\n\nEn una comparecencia urgente ante la prensa tras convocar a un gabinete de crisis, la ministra espa\u00f1ola de Sanidad, Ana Mato, asegur\u00f3 la pasada noche que las autoridades sanitarias est\u00e1n trabajando contrarreloj para encontrar cu\u00e1l ha podido ser la fuente de contacto que ha permitido el contagio de la enfermera espa\u00f1ola.\n\nAl mismo tiempo, intent\u00f3 transmitir un mensaje de tranquilidad a la poblaci\u00f3n, al afirmar que se est\u00e1n tomando todas y cada una de las medidas de seguridad para evitar contagios. Espa\u00f1a, dijo, cuenta con excelentes profesionales y los mecanismos adecuados para hacer frente a esta emergencia sanitaria.\n\nSeg\u00fan fuentes sanitarias espa\u00f1olas, la enfermera comenz\u00f3 unas vacaciones justo despu\u00e9s del fallecimiento de Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, en cuya habitaci\u00f3n estuvo dos veces: una para atenderle y otra justo despu\u00e9s de su muerte, seg\u00fan explic\u00f3 anoche en rueda de prensa el director general de Atenci\u00f3n Primaria de la Comunidad de Madrid, Antonio Alemany. Se supone que en uno de esos momentos se produjo el contagio, aunque no se sabe c\u00f3mo de produjo.\n\nEn la rueda de prensa no se aclar\u00f3 con cu\u00e1ntas personas pudo haber estado en contacto la enfermera contagiada, ni d\u00f3nde pas\u00f3 sus vacaciones. Se conoce que est\u00e1 casada y no tiene hijos. Su marido est\u00e1 siendo sometido a vigilancia epidemiol\u00f3gica, ya que se considera que existe un \"umbral de seguridad\" de quince d\u00edas tras el contagio, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ese per\u00edodo se considera que el sistema inmune ha superado la infecci\u00f3n.\n\nDe acuerdo con las normas internacionales, a quienes han estado en contacto con enfermos de \u00e9bola se les toma la temperatura de manera regular (dos veces al d\u00eda) durante los 21 d\u00edas posteriores al contacto. Fuentes sanitarias espa\u00f1olas aseguran que tiene que haber un contacto directo con el enfermo, especialmente sus fluidos, para que se produzca un contagio.\n\nDos religiosos espa\u00f1oles, v\u00edctimas de la enfermedad\n\nAl recuento tr\u00e1gico de v\u00edctimas mortales por la enfermedad en \u00c1frica occidental, se sum\u00f3 el pasado 26 de septiembre el fallecimiento del m\u00e9dico y religioso espa\u00f1ol Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, de 69 a\u00f1os, quien dirig\u00eda el Hospital San Juan de Dios en Lunsar, Sierra Leona, donde contrajo la enfermedad.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de cirujano, Garc\u00eda Viejo era m\u00e9dico especialista en medicina interna y diplomado en medicina tropical. En los \u00faltimos 30 a\u00f1os trabaj\u00f3 en el continente africano, en Ghana, Camer\u00fan y Sierra Leona.\n\nLa muerte de Garc\u00eda Viejo, miembro de la Orden Hospitalaria de San Juan de Dios (OHSJD), se produjo cuatro d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de que fuera repatriado en un avi\u00f3n militar espa\u00f1ol, especialmente preparado para tratar al paciente y evitar contagios.\n\nTambi\u00e9n sucedi\u00f3 as\u00ed con el religioso y m\u00e9dico de la misma orden, Miguel Pajares, fallecido el pasado 12 de agosto en una unidad especial -totalmente aislada del exterior- del hospital Carlos III de Madrid. Pajares, de 75 a\u00f1os, hab\u00eda contra\u00eddo la infecci\u00f3n al estar en contacto con el director del Hospital de San Jos\u00e9 en Monrovia (Liberia), infectado con el \u00e9bola.\n\nLos sanitarios que atendieron a Garc\u00eda Viejo no pudieron administrarle el suero experimental ZMapp al estar agotadas las existencias. Pajares s\u00ed fue tratado con ZMapp, medicamento que ya no est\u00e1 disponible y que se ha administrado a dos pacientes estadounidenses, Kent Brantly y Nancy Writebol, dados de alta tras ser tratados en Atlanta, Estados Unidos.\n\nEl brote de \u00e9bola \"tipo Zaire\", declarado el pasado mes de marzo en Guinea Conakry se ha extendido a poblaciones de Liberia, Sierra Leona, Nigeria y Senegal.\n\nVacuna experimental contra el \u00e9bola \"tipo Zaire\"\n\nPrecisamente, la Universidad de Oxford probar\u00e1 una vacuna experimental contra el virus del \u00e9bola en un ciudadano brit\u00e1nico, el primer voluntario para ese ensayo.\n\nSeg\u00fan el peri\u00f3dico brit\u00e1nico The Guardian, el voluntario en cuesti\u00f3n ser\u00e1 la primera persona, de un grupo total de 60, que recibir\u00e1 esa vacuna experimental en el Reino Unido.\n\nLa prueba forma parte de una primera serie de ensayos de vacunas potenciales para combatir la enfermedad en \u00c1frica occidental, donde el brote ha matado a cerca del 53% de los infectados.\n\nLa vacuna, desarrollada por los Institutos Nacionales de Salud de Estados Unidos y la farmac\u00e9utica brit\u00e1nica GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), est\u00e1 destinada a la variante \"tipo Zaire\", una de las cepas m\u00e1s agresivas del virus que circula en \u00c1frica occidental.\n\nUtiliza una \u00fanica prote\u00edna benigna del virus del \u00e9bola para generar una respuesta inmune. La universidad de Oxford asegura que la vacuna experimental no contiene material infeccioso. El ensayo se lleva a cabo en personas sanas, para comprobar si sufren efectos secundarios.\n\nSeg\u00fan la OMS, el virus del \u00e9bola causa en el ser humano la enfermedad hom\u00f3nima (antes conocida como fiebre hemorr\u00e1gica del \u00e9bola). Los brotes de enfermedad por el virus del \u00e9bola (EVE) tienen una tasa de mortalidad que puede llegar al 90%.",

La pareja no tiene hijos.\n\nEl coordinador del centro de Alertas y Emergencias del ministerio de Sanidad, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, dijo a la emisora Cadena SER que la enfermera estaba estable y que su vida no corr\u00eda peligro inmediato. Funcionarios sanitarios dijeron que no ten\u00eda m\u00e1s s\u00edntomas que la fiebre. Seg\u00fan informaciones en medios, tiene 44 a\u00f1os.\n\nSim\u00f3n dijo que su marido est\u00e1 \"bien y relativamente tranquilo\".\n\nHay riesgo bajo de que la gente que ha estado en contacto con la enfermera pueda desarrollar \u00e9bola, dijo Sim\u00f3n, que insisti\u00f3 en que no representa una amenaza para la salud p\u00fablica. Discuti\u00f3 a los cr\u00edticos que dijeron que la reacci\u00f3n de las autoridades sobre el caso fue lenta.\n\nLa enfermera, que fue hospitalizada el domingo, form\u00f3 parte del equipo que atendi\u00f3 al sacerdote espa\u00f1ol de 69 a\u00f1os Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, que muri\u00f3 el 25 de septiembre en un hospital de Madrid designado para el tratamiento de la enfermedad tras ser repatriado desde Sierra Leona.

Falleci\u00f3 tras ser tratado con el f\u00e1rmaco experimental ZMapp.\n\nGarc\u00eda Viejo, que estaba al frente del hospital San Juan del Dios hospital en Lunsar, en Sierra Leona, no recibi\u00f3 el tratamiento porque las existencias se hab\u00edan agotado en todo el mundo.\n\nEl virus que causa el \u00e9bola se transmite solo a trav\u00e9s de contacto directo con los fluidos corporales de una persona infectada y que muestre los s\u00edntomas de la enfermedad.\n\nEl caso dela enfermera espa\u00f1ola ilustra los peligros a los que se enfrenta el personal sanitario, no s\u00f3lo en cl\u00ednicas mal equipadas de \u00c1frica occidental, sino tambi\u00e9n en los m\u00e1s sofisticados centros m\u00e9dicos de Europa y Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan William Schaffner, experto en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de Vanderbilt.\n\n\"El mayor riesgo en todos los brotes lo corren los trabajadores sanitarios\", dijo.\n\nEn un estallido sin precedentes el brote de \u00e9bola registrado este a\u00f1o ha matado a m\u00e1s de 3.400 personas en \u00c1frica occidental, seg\u00fan estimaciones de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud, y plantea una creciente preocupaci\u00f3n para el resto del mundo. En los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s afectados -Liberia, Guinea y Sierra Leona- han fallecido m\u00e1s de 370 trabajadores sanitarios.\n\nEn Estados Unidos, el video periodista Ashoka Mukpo, que se infect\u00f3 cuando trabajaba en Liberia, lleg\u00f3 al Centro M\u00e9dico de Nebraska en Omaha, donde se atendi\u00f3 a otro paciente de \u00e9bola. No est\u00e1 claro c\u00f3mo se infect\u00f3 el reportero. Podr\u00eda haber ocurrido cuando ayud\u00f3 a limpiar un veh\u00edculo en el que hab\u00eda muerto una persona, indic\u00f3 su padre, el doctor Mithcell Levy. El lunes, sus s\u00edntomas de fiebre y n\u00e1useas parec\u00edan todav\u00eda leves, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Levy.\n\nMukpo es el quinto estadounidense que contrae la enfermedad y es evacuado desde el \u00c1frica occidental para recibir atenci\u00f3n. Los otros eran trabajadores humanitarios, tres de ellos se recuperaron y uno sigue hospitalizado.\n\nNo hay f\u00e1rmacos aprobados para el \u00e9bola, as\u00ed que los m\u00e9dicos han probado tratamientos experimentales en unos pocos casos.\n\nTambi\u00e9n otro enfermo, el hombre de Liberia hospitalizado en Dallas en estado cr\u00edtico, est\u00e1 recibiendo un tratamiento experimental, indic\u00f3 el lunes el Hospital Presbiteriano de Salud de Texas. Thomas Eric Duncan es la primera persona a la que se diagnostic\u00f3 la enfermedad en Estados Unidos. Fue ingresado en el hospital el 28 de septiembre, una semana despu\u00e9s de llegar a Texas.\n\nEl gobernador de Texas Rick Perry inst\u00f3 al gobierno de Estados Unidos a que controle a quienes lleguen al pa\u00eds en avi\u00f3n procedentes de pa\u00edses infectados por el \u00e9bola, incluyendo el tomarles la temperatura.\n\nEl centro texano indic\u00f3 que Duncan estaba recibiendo un f\u00e1rmaco experimental llamado brincidofovir, desarrollado para combatir otro tipo de virus. Pruebas de laboratorio indican que tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda funcionar contra el \u00e9bola.\n\nTambi\u00e9n se han utilizado otros dos f\u00e1rmacos experimentales desarrollados espec\u00edficamente para el \u00e9bola, aunque no est\u00e1 claro si han tenido alg\u00fan efecto. El escaso suministro de ZMapp se acab\u00f3 tras su uso en unos pocos pacientes, aunque las autoridades dicen que deber\u00eda haber m\u00e1s disponible en los pr\u00f3ximos dos meses. Una segunda medicaci\u00f3n, TKM-Ebola de la farmac\u00e9utica Tekmira, se ha utilizado al menos en un paciente y se ha indicado que hay existencias limitadas.\n\nObama dijo que Estados Unidos \"trabajar\u00e1 en protocolos para hacer controles adicionales de pasajeros tanto en la fuente como aqu\u00ed en Estados Unidos\", aunque no dio detalles ni ofreci\u00f3 un calendario para nuevas medidas.",

El virus se transmite por fluidos corporales y es detectado algunas semanas despu\u00e9s de contra\u00eddo, por lo que la enfermera espa\u00f1ola pudo haber contagiado sin tener plena conciencia de ello.\n\nAunque los hospitales de Europa Occidental -a diferencia de las zonas afectadas en \u00c1frica- tienen instalaciones para aislar a pacientes enfermos, la directora europea de la OMS, Zsuzsanna Jakab, asegur\u00f3 que \"es bastante inevitable (...) que tales incidentes sucedan en el futuro por los viajes entre Europa y los pa\u00edses afectados\".\n\nLa enfermera espa\u00f1ola Teresa Romero se fue de vacaciones despu\u00e9s de que el segundo de sus pacientes de \u00e9bola muriera el 25 de setiembre, pero no empez\u00f3 a sentirse enferma hasta el 30 de ese mes. El sindicato en el que participa dijo que pidi\u00f3 tres veces hacerse la prueba del \u00e9bola antes de que se confirmara finalmente la infecci\u00f3n el 6 de octubre.\n\nEl caso de la espa\u00f1ola lleva a que las autoridades sanitarias del mundo desarrollado comiencen a verse obligadas a reexaminar sus sistemas de alerta ante una enfermedad que est\u00e1 devastando Guinea, Sierra Leona y Liberia desde marzo, con una mortalidad superior a la mitad de los infectados.\n\nEl tema es que hay mucho trabajo por delante. Ayer el profesor belga Peter Piot, uno de los descubridores del \u00e9bola en 1976, asegur\u00f3 que no hay que tener p\u00e1nico pero que mientras no haya una vacuna, el aislamiento y la cuarentena no son suficientes para parar la epidemia.\n\n\"El problema est\u00e1 en que el cuidado de enfermos de \u00e9bola es muy intensivo y cuando llega el final del d\u00eda, en el momento de quitarse el uniforme de protecci\u00f3n, un peque\u00f1o gesto, como frotarse los ojos al quitarse las gafas, puede provocar el contagio\", detall\u00f3 el experto en un foro en el que participaron 16 especialistas del virus.\n\nPiot aclar\u00f3, para tranquilidad de los occidentales, que \"hay diferencias con lo que est\u00e1 ocurriendo en \u00c1frica\", que \"no dar\u00e1 origen a brotes en Europa\".\n\nSeg\u00fan datos oficiales, en los \u00faltimos 38 a\u00f1os fallecieron por \u00e9bola unas 15.000 personas \"y s\u00f3lo en los \u00faltimos meses ha pasado a ser un problema sanitario de salud p\u00fablica\", seg\u00fan Piot. En esta \u00faltima crisis la enfermedad se cobr\u00f3 unas 3.431 vidas y caus\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 7000 infecciones.\n\nReproches ante los fallos\n\nAyer decenas de m\u00e9dicos y enfermeras se manifestaron fuera del Hospital La Paz Hospital de Madrid exigiendo m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre c\u00f3mo se contagi\u00f3 Romero de \u00e9bola.\n\n\"Dado que tanto los mecanismos de transmisi\u00f3n como las medidas de prevenci\u00f3n son conocidas, es evidente que se ha producido alg\u00fan error\", afirm\u00f3 el Colegio de M\u00e9dicos de Madrid en un comunicado.\n\nAnte la situaci\u00f3n, los agremiados en el Servicio Madrile\u00f1o de Salud reclamaron ayer a las autoridades que se les den protocolos y formaci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica para abordar los posibles casos con mayores garant\u00edas. \"No sirve con una charla de 20 o 30 minutos para explicarte c\u00f3mo ponerte un equipo de protecci\u00f3n individual o que se copien procedimientos de organizaciones m\u00e9dicas internacionales. Es necesario que cada centro tenga un protocolo adecuado a los medios y recursos disponibles\", solicit\u00f3 Juli\u00e1n Ezquerra, secretario general de la Asociaci\u00f3n de M\u00e9dicos y Titulados Superiores.\n\nLos reclamos a las autoridades espa\u00f1olas llegaron hasta desde Bruselas, donde la Comisi\u00f3n Europea pidi\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de su portavoz que el ministerio de Sanidad \"esclarezca\" lo ocurrido. \"Hubo evidentemente un problema en alg\u00fan momento\", consider\u00f3 Frederic Vincent.\n\nPrivilegios de occidentales\n\nEn contraste con lo que sucede con la gran mayor\u00eda de los pacientes africanos, algunos en Europa y Estados Unidos han recibido tratamientos experimentales contra el \u00e9bola, sin cura probada.\n\nEn Madrid, Romero recibi\u00f3 anticuerpos de pacientes que sobrevivieron al virus. Y el Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital de Dallas inform\u00f3 que el paciente Thomas Eric Duncan -ayer en estado cr\u00edtico- recibi\u00f3 el f\u00e1rmaco experimental brincidofovir, desarrollado por Chimerix Inc para ser usado contra un virus respiratorio, pero que no ha sido probado a\u00fan en pacientes con \u00e9bola.\n\nLas autoridades espa\u00f1olas afirmaron que el esposo de Romero no mostr\u00f3 hasta el momento s\u00edntomas de la enfermedad. Los otros ingresados en el pa\u00eds son un trabajador de salud con diarrea pero sin fiebre y un espa\u00f1ol que viaj\u00f3 desde Nigeria. Se confirm\u00f3 que una enfermera que estaba vigilada por parecer sospechosa de poseer el virus no est\u00e1 contagiada, al menos por el momento.\n\nA otras 22 personas que entraron en contacto con la enfermera se les toma la temperatura dos veces al d\u00eda pero no est\u00e1n aislados.",

Se\u00f1alan que el caso de la enfermera espa\u00f1ola ha provocado una gran inquietud en toda Europa y demandas de explicaciones por parte de la UE. Recogen las denuncias de falta de formaci\u00f3n al personal que trat\u00f3 a los misioneros enfermos y las peticiones de dimisi\u00f3n de la ministra Ana Mato. Numerosos medios tambi\u00e9n se hacen eco de la pol\u00e9mica desatada con el perro de la enfermera.\n\nNew York Times resalta que aumentan las demandas de explicaciones y las cr\u00edticas a Espa\u00f1a tras el contagio de la enfermera. La cr\u00f3nica de Rapahel Minder apunta que el gobierno espa\u00f1ol fue objeto de fuertes cr\u00edticas el martes al enfrentarse a las repercusiones de primer caso de \u00c9bola en Europa Occidental, poner en cuarentena a tres personas m\u00e1s y monitorizar a decenas de personas m\u00e1s que estuvieron en contacto con la enfermera infectada. A\u00f1ade que trabajadores sanitarios, que han peleado con el gobierno por los recortes, dijeron que no hab\u00edan recibido la formaci\u00f3n adecuada, ni el equipo para manejar un caso de \u00c9bola. Y se hace eco de las peticiones de dimisi\u00f3n de Ana Mato y la petici\u00f3n de explicaciones de la UE.\n\nLe Monde constata que el fallo del sistemasanitario espa\u00f1ol inquieta a Europa. El art\u00edculo de su corresponsal Sandrine Morel asegura que Bruselas espera \"aclaraciones\" del Ministerio de Sanidad espa\u00f1ol sobre el fallo que ha originado causa la infecci\u00f3n con Ebola de una auxiliar de enfermer\u00eda en Madrid. Y cita a un portavoz que resalta que \"obviamente ha habido un problema en alguna parte\", cuando se supone que los Estados miembros han puesto en pr\u00e1ctica procedimientos coordinados para evitar la entrada del virus en la Uni\u00f3n. Aunque recoge que la OMS que el riesgo \"sigue siendo bajo en Europa\", apunta que el contagio en Madrid es un fracaso nacional e internacional. Y se hace eco de que en Espa\u00f1a la c\u00f3lera aumenta y los temores a una epidemia han dado paso a la indignaci\u00f3n contra el gobierno.\n\nBBC plantea \"\u00bfComo pudo el virus del \u00c9bola contagiarse en un hospital de Espa\u00f1a\". Apunta que las autoridades espa\u00f1olas no saben c\u00f3mo puede haber pasado y aseguran que se tomaron todas las medidas de seguridad seg\u00fan los m\u00e1s altos est\u00e1ndares marcados por la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y del centro de control de referencia europeo. Pero a\u00f1ade: \"A\u00fan as\u00ed, enferm\u00f3\". Y recoge que una vez confirmado el caso, no se hicieron esperar las denuncias de trabajadores de salud negando que se hubieran cumplido tales est\u00e1ndares y hablando de falta de preparaci\u00f3n. Y recoge el testimonio de una doctora que se\u00f1ala que es \"muy dif\u00edcil quitarse el equipo sin recontaminarse uno mismo. El personal debe ser entrenado practicando no s\u00f3lo leyendo los protocolos.\"\n\nWall Street Journal se hace eco de la pol\u00e9mica por el intento de sacrificar al perro de la enfermera y lo ve como otra muestra de las reacciones de angustia en Espa\u00f1a. Explica que Entre las vidas en juego porla propagaci\u00f3n del \u00e9bola fuera de \u00c1frica est\u00e1 la de Excalibur, el perro de la enfermera contagiada. Recoge la pretensi\u00f3n de la Comunidad de Madrid sacrificarlo para evitar un posible contagio y del llamamiento de Javier Lim\u00f3n, esposo de la auxiliar para salvarle. Y se\u00f1ala que \"su s\u00faplica toc\u00f3 un nervio\" y los defensores de los animales respondieron con r\u00e1fagas de tweets que hicieron del hashtag #SalvemosaExcalibur TT y una petici\u00f3n on line firmada por m\u00e1s 86.000 personas. Fue otra muestra de las reacciones de angustia de los espa\u00f1oles tras el primer caso de \u00c9bola en su pa\u00eds.\"\n\nUSA Today se\u00f1ala que el caso de \u00c9bola ha sacudido a Espa\u00f1a y provocado una investigaci\u00f3n. Asegura que el primer caso de Ebola transmitido fuera de \u00c1frica ha desatado una mayor preocupaci\u00f3n por la seguridad de los trabajadores sanitarios y algunas quejas sobre la falta de formaci\u00f3n y equipos para manejar el virus. Partidos de la oposici\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola pidieron la dimisi\u00f3n de la ministra de Salud, Ana Mato, y la Uni\u00f3n Europea ha exigido respuestas a la pregunta de qu\u00e9 sali\u00f3 mal.\n\nLes Echos constata que el \u00c9bola desembarca en Europa y que Espa\u00f1a est\u00e1 en el punto de mira. Recoge que el marido de la enfermera y otras tres personas est\u00e1n en quarentena ante la posibilidad de que tambi\u00e9n hayan sido infectados y lo se\u00f1ala como \"motivo de alarma\" aunque las autoridades europeas intentan subrayar eque el riesgo de epidemia es muy bajo gracias a las infraestructuras y redes de alerta. Pero a\u00f1ade que la enfermera apenas recibi\u00f3 15 minutos de formaci\u00f3n sobre como tratar un caso de \u00c9bola cuando en Cruz Roja la formaci\u00f3n dura 8 d\u00edas. Y se hace eco de denuncias de fallos en el tratamiento de enfermos, especialmente graves al tratarse de una hospital de referencia para \u00c9bola.\n\nTime apunta que el caso de Ebola en Espa\u00f1a muestra que hay fallos en la defensa contra la enfermedad. Se\u00f1alq que a pesar de los rigurosos controles y protocolos, una auxiliar de enfermer\u00eda en Madrid contrajo la enfermedad de un paciente. Recuerda que las autoridades espa\u00f1olas aseguraron a los ciudadanos nerviosos por la repatriaci\u00f3n de los misioneros que los estrictos protocolos evitar\u00edan la la trasmisi\u00f3n del virus... pero algo fall\u00f3. Y apunta que el hecho de que los protocolos no hayan evitado el contagio de la enfermera espa\u00f1ola plantea la cuesti\u00f3n de que Europa puede estar menos preparada contra el \u00c9bola de lo que piensa. Y avisa que aunque no es probable una gran epidemia de \u00c9bola en Europa, los trabajadores sanitarios ser\u00e1n los m\u00e1s afectados.\n\nLiberation constata que Espa\u00f1a se moviliza contra el virus ante la inquietud de Europa. Explica que las autoridades sanitarias espa\u00f1olas se han lanzado en un carrera contrarreloj para identificar a los contactos de la primera persona que ha contra\u00eddo el \u00c9bola fuera de \u00c1frica al tiempo que intentan responder a las preguntas de una Europa inquieta. Y recoge que la Comisi\u00f3n de la UE ha pedido a Espa\u00f1a que aclare que pudo fallar cuando se supone que los estados miembros han puesto en marcha medidas coordinadas para prevenir la entrada del virus en la UE que cuenta con 507 millones de habitantes.\n\nDaily Beast resalta que el contagio en un hospital no ayuda a calmar el miedo extendido en Europa. Asegura que el temor a una epidemia se ha ido extendiendo por Europa en las \u00faltimas semanas, mientras miles de refugiados e inmigrantes de \u00c1frica lelgan a las costas italianas y espa\u00f1olas. Y a\u00f1ade que el hecho de que la primera contaminaci\u00f3n haya ocurrido en un ambiente controlado de un hospital hace poco para calmar los nervios. y cita a Giovanni Rezza, experto italiano en enfermedades infecciosas que dice: \"La infecci\u00f3n de la enfermera es algo que nunca deber\u00eda haber ocurrido. Pero en un caso como \u00e9ste, apenas un peque\u00f1o error en el procedimiento puede resultar fatal\".",

Adem\u00e1s, se orden\u00f3 poner bajo vigilancia a 52 m\u00e9dicos y auxiliares que entraron en contacto con Romero en la \u00faltima semana.\n\nEl estallido de la crisis sanitaria encendi\u00f3 las alarmas en la Uni\u00f3n Europea (UE), que pidi\u00f3 ayer a Espa\u00f1a que aclare de manera urgente las fallas en su sistema de salud que pudieron haber provocado el contagio de \u00c9bola.\n\n\"Hubo evidentemente un problema. Desde hace meses los Estados miembros hacen un seguimiento y coordinan sus procedimientos nacionales a nivel europeo para prevenir el ingreso del virus en el territorio europeo\", inform\u00f3 Frederic Vincent, vocero de la Comisi\u00f3n Europea para temas de salud. Hoy se reunir\u00e1 en Bruselas para tratar el caso espa\u00f1ol el Comit\u00e9 de Seguridad Sanitaria de la UE, que re\u00fane a expertos de los 28 pa\u00edses del bloque y de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS).\n\nEl riesgo de un brote en Europa todav\u00eda se vislumbra como \"altamente improbable\" seg\u00fan Vincent, pero resulta imprescindible determinar qu\u00e9 pudo haber pasado y aislar el caso detectado.\n\nLos espa\u00f1oles viv\u00edan entre la angustia y el fastidio el d\u00eda siguiente de la confirmaci\u00f3n del primer contagio de \u00c9bola fuera de la zona caliente del oeste africano, donde ya murieron m\u00e1s de 3400 personas, seg\u00fan la OMS. A la inquietud que empezaba a instalarse en la poblaci\u00f3n se sumaban las protestas del personal m\u00e9dico del hospital donde trataron a los infectados con el virus y las denuncias pol\u00edticas por errores cometidos en el caso de la enfermera Romero.\n\nLa mujer trabaja en el hospital Carlos III. Cuando repatriaron de \u00c1frica primero al sacerdote Miguel Pajares y despu\u00e9s a Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo ella se ofreci\u00f3 como voluntaria para atenderlos. Los dos llegaron a Espa\u00f1a en aviones del gobierno, en un intento desesperado de salvarlos.\n\nPajares muri\u00f3 en agosto. Garc\u00eda Viejo, el 25 de septiembre. Cinco d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, Romero se present\u00f3 en los servicios de riesgo laboral del hospital porque ten\u00eda unas l\u00edneas de fiebre. Pero como no llegaba a 38,6\u00ba la enviaron a la casa.\n\n\"Es evidente que hubiera sido mejor ingresarla, teniendo en cuenta que hab\u00eda estado en contacto con dos enfermos de \u00c9bola\", admiti\u00f3 ayer Fernando Sim\u00f3n, del Ministerio de Salud espa\u00f1ol.\n\nEl cuadro se agrav\u00f3 y al final a la mujer la trasladaron el lunes a un hospital cercano a su casa, en el municipio madrile\u00f1o de Alcorc\u00f3n. Hasta que se confirm\u00f3 el diagn\u00f3stico estuvo en contacto con al menos 30 profesionales que no contaban con los trajes herm\u00e9ticos requeridos para atender un caso de semejante riesgo.\n\n\"Los protocolos de actuaci\u00f3n no han funcionado. No hay suficientes equipos de protecci\u00f3n individual ni del nivel de seguridad suficiente para que nuestros profesionales de salud los puedan usar\", denunci\u00f3 Elena Moral, de la Central Sindical Independiente y de Funcionarios (CSIF). Ya lo hab\u00edan advertido en julio, cuando se dispuso el traslado del cura Pajares. Junto con otros gremialistas pidi\u00f3 la renuncia de la ministra de Salud, Ana Mato, a la que acusan de haber decidido la repatriaci\u00f3n de los misioneros en condiciones precarias de seguridad para los trabajadores.\n\nAnoche hubo algo de alivio al conocerse que hab\u00eda dado negativo la prueba de \u00c9bola que le hab\u00edan hecho a la otra enfermera internada con posibles s\u00edntomas. Le dieron el alta de inmediato. Todav\u00eda no hay informaci\u00f3n clara sobre el estado del marido de Romero, cuyas posibilidades de contagio se consideran altas. El hombre habl\u00f3 por tel\u00e9fono con varios medios, dijo que se encontraba bien, sin s\u00edntomas. Tambi\u00e9n defendi\u00f3 la forma en que su esposa hab\u00eda actuado con los enfermos de \u00c9bola: \"Hizo todo lo que le pidieron\", dijo.\n\nA Romero la tratan con anticuerpos de una mujer que tuvo \u00c9bola y se cur\u00f3. Si fuera necesario se le dar\u00e1n medicamentos experimentales. De todos modos, la enfermera prohibi\u00f3 que se difundiera su parte m\u00e9dico.\n\nLas autoridades sanitarias contin\u00faan con la reconstrucci\u00f3n de la lista de personas que tuvieron trato con ella en los \u00faltimos 15 d\u00edas. \"Existe la posibilidad de que alguno de sus contactos pueda estar infectado. Eso no implica un riesgo para la poblaci\u00f3n, pero tenemos que tomar todos los recaudos\", se\u00f1al\u00f3 Sim\u00f3n.\n\nDe urgencia, el gobierno habilit\u00f3 para resolver dudas una l\u00ednea gratuita, que anoche estaba colapsada. Una se\u00f1al de la psicosis que empieza a sentirse en Madrid..\n\nDel editor: qu\u00e9 significa. El \u00c9bola en Espa\u00f1a es el fruto de una sucesi\u00f3n de fallos que deja mal parado al pa\u00eds ante Europa. Es tambi\u00e9n un peligro al que est\u00e1 expuesto todo el bloque.",

Una enfermera espa\u0144ola se convirti\u00f3 ayer en la primera persona en infectarse de \u00e9bola en Espa\u0144a y fuera de la zona de brote en el oeste de \u00c1frica, un hecho que genera inquietud en otras partes del mundo.\n\nEn Estados Unidos, el gobierno federal sopesa ordenar la revisi\u00f3n minuciosa de los pasajeros que lleguen de la regi\u00f3n (ver nota aparte).\n\nEn un hospital de Dallas, un hombre liberiano gravemente enfermo, Thomas Duncan, empez\u00f3 a recibir un medicamento experimental, mientras que el camar\u00f3grafo estadounidense que regres\u00f3 ayer de Liberia para recibir tratamiento en EE. UU. empez\u00f3 a presentar se\u0144ales alentadoras. Ashoka Mukpo, de 33 a\u0144os, pudo salir del avi\u00f3n por su propio pie para abordar una ambulancia.\n\nEn Texas, trabajadores de salud eran algunos de los estadounidenses que esperaban descubrir si hab\u00edan sido infectados por Duncan, quien se encuentra muy grave.\n\nMientras tanto en Espa\u0144a, la enfermera infectada con el virus hab\u00eda formado parte de un equipo que atendi\u00f3 a un sacerdote con \u00e9bola que fue repatriado desde Sierra Leona. El misionero de 69 a\u0144os muri\u00f3 en el hospital.\n\nEl \u00fanico s\u00edntoma de la enfermera era fiebre, pero se confirm\u00f3 la infecci\u00f3n con dos pruebas, dijeron funcionarios de sanidad de Espa\u0144a. Estaba siendo atendida en aislamiento, mientras las autoridades elaboraban una lista de las personas con las que tuvo contacto.\n\nTambi\u00e9n un noruego\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la organizaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) confirm\u00f3 ayer que uno de sus cooperantes noruegos desplazados en Sierra Leona ha sido infectado con \u00e9bola.\n\nEl cooperante, del que no ha sido facilitada la identidad, fue puesto en aislamiento tras padecer fiebre y dio positivo en una prueba posterior para detectar el virus.\n\n\"Estamos trabajando ahora para llevar a casa a nuestro colega tan r\u00e1pido como sea posible\", declar\u00f3 en un comunicado Anne Cecilie Kaltenborn, secretaria general de MSF en Noruega.\n\nY si bien la Casa Blanca descart\u00f3 cualquier medida que proh\u00edba viajes procedentes del occidente de \u00c1frica y dijo que la mejor manera de proteger a los estadounidenses es detener el brote ah\u00ed.\n\nCon ese fin, el ej\u00e9rcito de Estados Unidos empez\u00f3 a construir los primeros de 17 centros de tratamiento contra el \u00e9bola en Liberia, cada uno con espacio para 100 pacientes, y a capacitar a unos 4,000 soldados para que ayuden con la crisis.\n\n\"Lo tr\u00e1gico de esta situaci\u00f3n es que el \u00e9bola se est\u00e1 propagando r\u00e1pidamente entre las poblaciones del oeste de \u00c1frica que no tienen esa clase de infraestructura m\u00e9dica\", dijo Josh Earnest, portavoz de la Casa Blanca.\n\nSe cree que el brote de \u00e9bola ha causado la muerte de m\u00e1s de 3,400 personas en el oeste de \u00c1frica, la mayor\u00eda de ellas en Liberia. Las \u00e1reas de aislamiento no tienen suficientes camas para atender a los cientos de enfermos que cada semana solicitan atenci\u00f3n.\n\nAunque el espacio es sumamente necesario, algunos expertos est\u00e1n preocupados por qui\u00e9n los atender\u00e1. Los pa\u00edses m\u00e1s afectados, Liberia, Guinea y Sierra Leona, tienen muy pocos doctores y enfermeras, y el contagio de muchos de ellos ha diezmado a\u00fan m\u00e1s a ese personal. M\u00e1s de 370 trabajadores de la salud han enfermado, por lo que muchos otros especialistas temen atender a pacientes enfermos de \u00e9bola.\n\nUnos 350 efectivos estadounidenses ya se encuentran en Liberia, dijo el Pent\u00e1gono, con el fin de iniciar la construcci\u00f3n de un hospital de campa\u0144a para personal m\u00e9dico infectado con \u00e9bola. Una lluvia torrencial retras\u00f3 ayer el inicio de esas labores. -- AGENCIAS.",

Ayer instaur\u00f3 un gabinete de crisis, cuyo alcance se desconoce pero de efecto contemporizador mientras llega la calma a la indignada sociedad espa\u00f1ola, siempre inconforme con conocer la medida de sus problemas solo por las versiones oficiales\n\n\"Hay un fallo en el protocolo, es evidente\", subray\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n el diputado del partido centrista UPyD Toni Cant\u00f3, dirigi\u00e9ndose a la directora general de Salud P\u00fablica, Mercedes Vinuesa, interrogada por una comisi\u00f3n parlamentaria.\n\n\"Espa\u00f1a colabora siguiendo todas las recomendaciones de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS)\", se defendi\u00f3 ella.\n\nAl mismo tiempo, desde su ministerio se admiti\u00f3 que \"algo ha fallado\": \"vamos a revisar (los protocolos), aunque otra opci\u00f3n es que se haya podido errar, no s\u00e9 si de manera humana o t\u00e9cnica\", afirm\u00f3 Fernando Sim\u00f3n, del Centro de Alertas y Emergencias.\n\nExplicaciones insuficientes para la oposici\u00f3n, que reclamaba en bloque ayer la comparecencia ante los diputados de la ministra de Salud, Ana Mato, quien la noche del lunes llam\u00f3 a la poblaci\u00f3n a la calma.\n\n\"\u00a1Ana Mato, dimisi\u00f3n!\", gritaban varias decenas de m\u00e9dicos y enfermeros que salieron a manifestarse ayer ante los hospitales madrile\u00f1os de La Paz y Carlos III, donde se trata a los pacientes afectados de \u00e9bola. \"Todo se hizo deprisa y corriendo\", denunci\u00f3 Elena Moral, una portavoz del sindicato de funcionarios CSI-F.\n\nEste gremio, como otros, hab\u00eda denunciado la \"improvisaci\u00f3n\" cuando el primer misionero espa\u00f1ol enfermo de \u00e9bola fue repatriado de Liberia, el 7 de agosto.\n\nCuatro personas fueron hospitalizadas para intentar contener la expansi\u00f3n del \u00e9bola. La enfermera Teresa Romero Ramos (que dio positivo el lunes), su esposo (quien no muestra s\u00edntomas) y otras dos personas son monitoreadas de cerca en el hospital. Adem\u00e1s, las autoridades sanitarias mantienen bajo vigilancia a medio centenar de personas que pudieron tener contacto con Ramos.\n\nLa directora regional de la OMS, Zsuzsanna Jakab, cree que es inevitable que haya m\u00e1s casos de \u00e9bola en el continente \"por los viajes entre Europa y los pa\u00edses afectados\".",

Todo empez\u00f3 cuando este Gobierno de despotismo blando, que sigue el buenismo laico de Zapatero, decidi\u00f3 trasladar, en una operaci\u00f3n de propaganda, al religioso Manuel Garc\u00eda Viejo, infectado en Sierra Leona, hasta el Hospital de La Paz.\n\nLos pol\u00edticos buscan la luz de la tele como los mosquitos las bombillas para hacer propaganda, pero esta vez les ha estallado la c\u00e1mara en los ojos. Acaban de hacer el rid\u00edculo ante el mundo entero: en vez de salvar dos vidas, han terminado amenazando con la peste a miles de ciudadanos, despu\u00e9s de que una enfermera que atendi\u00f3 al misionero se contagiara del virus.\n\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n dirigi\u00f3 tan absurda y esperp\u00e9ntica pel\u00edcula de terror, aunque parec\u00eda de ciencia ficci\u00f3n? La gente apoy\u00f3 la operaci\u00f3n porque los misioneros espa\u00f1oles, desde la conquista de Am\u00e9rica, son admirados. Acompa\u00f1aron a los conquistadores, aliviaron la crueldad contra los indios. Despu\u00e9s, protagonizaron haza\u00f1as luchando contra la lepra, la tiran\u00eda y la ignorancia en el Tercer Mundo. Hasta el Papa macanudo que vive en Roma elogi\u00f3 recientemente las proezas de los frailes que dejan su patria para anunciar el Evangelio en todo el mundo.\n\nClaro que la epopeya de los misioneros tiene otra lectura, seg\u00fan la cual las misiones contribuyen a la perpetuaci\u00f3n del esclavismo. \"Se cuenta -coment\u00f3 Desmond Tutu- una historia conocida de cuando los misioneros vinieron a \u00c1frica. Ellos ten\u00edan la Biblia y nosotros, los nativos, la tierra. Y entonces ellos dijeron: 'Vamos rezar'. Y nosotros, obedientemente, cerramos los ojos. Y cuando volvimos a abrirlos, ellos ten\u00edan la tierra y nosotros la Biblia\".\n\nComentan algunos m\u00e9dicos que estamos ante una enfermedad in\u00e9dita en Europa y que no tiene tratamiento. Todas las personas que frecuentaron a los enfermos deber\u00edan haber estado en cuarentena y no lo estuvieron. Nunca debi\u00f3 llevarse a la enfermera al Hospital de Alcorc\u00f3n; ni a los misioneros al Carlos III, casi derruido, sin orden ni concierto, con una plantilla improvisada. Insist\u00edan en que ten\u00edamos el mejor sistema sanitario del mundo pero, a la vista de lo que ha ocurrido, el Tercer Mundo se nos cuela por todas partes. Lo extra\u00f1o es que no se cayera el avi\u00f3n que trajo a los misioneros desde \u00c1frica.\n\nSe vistieron de astronautas, con gafas de marciano, para nacionalizar el virus. Ahora dicen que no hay riesgo para la poblaci\u00f3n y, como mienten tanto, los ciudadanos creen lo contrario, porque la propia pol\u00edtica es un cuadro cl\u00ednico.",

Y, por supuesto, no existe quien pueda garantizar al cien por cien que, tras traer a Espa\u00f1a a los dos religiosos enfermos de \u00e9bola, nadie resultar\u00eda infectado. Por lo tanto, puede parecer injusto acusar ahora al Gobierno de incompetencia sin haber censurado en su d\u00eda su decisi\u00f3n de repatriar a esos dos espa\u00f1oles. Y, sin embargo, no lo es. En primer lugar, porque no s\u00f3lo es que una de las enfermeras que trat\u00f3 a los pacientes ha resultado finalmente infectada, sino que cuando present\u00f3 los primeros s\u00edntomas se permiti\u00f3 que se marchara de vacaciones. A estas alturas no sabemos qui\u00e9n tom\u00f3 esa est\u00fapida decisi\u00f3n, pero cabe la posibilidad de que se fundara en consideraciones pol\u00edticas, en especial la de evitar las acusaciones que generar\u00eda el ingresar a la enfermera como sospechosa de haberse contagiado.\n\nPero hay m\u00e1s pruebas de la incompetencia del Gobierno en este asunto. Muy pocos espa\u00f1oles estaban en condiciones de poder medir los riesgos que entra\u00f1aba para nuestra sanidad repatriar a los dos religiosos. Para valorar la responsabilidad del Gobierno habr\u00eda que saber qu\u00e9 porcentaje de riesgo de infecci\u00f3n calcularon los expertos y qu\u00e9 medidas aconsejaron para minimizarlo. Nada que no hubiera estado muy cerca del cero deber\u00eda haber sido aceptable para la ministra de Sanidad y el presidente del Gobierno. Sospecho que, ya fuera por falta de t\u00e9cnicos, por no disponer de los medios que \u00e9stos aconsejaran o por no querer escucharlos, los pol\u00edticos tomaron la decisi\u00f3n sin que nadie con obvio conocimiento de causa asumiera la responsabilidad de haber llevado a cabo la repatriaci\u00f3n y hospitalizaci\u00f3n del modo que finalmente se hizo. De haber habido qui\u00e9n, ya habr\u00edan las terminales del Gobierno descargado sobre ellos toda la responsabilidad. Y lo habr\u00edan hecho con filtraci\u00f3n a la prensa de los correspondientes informes. Si como me barrunto fue el Gobierno quien tom\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n sin haberse procurado consejo fiable, estar\u00edamos ante un caso de temeridad m\u00e1s que de incompetencia.\n\nDe momento, ya tenemos que asumir el coste econ\u00f3mico y en puestos de trabajo que para el turismo va a suponer esto, sin contar las medidas que puede acabar adoptando Bruselas. No quiero ni pensar en lo que ocurrir\u00e1 si empiezan a multiplicarse los casos ni lo mucho que puede tardar este Gobierno en tomar las medidas que en tal caso habr\u00eda que adoptar. Y encima de todo est\u00e1n esos espa\u00f1oles cuyas vidas se han puesto gratuitamente en peligro, al menos desde el 30 de septiembre, cuando la enfermera infectada acudi\u00f3 al hospital con fiebre y se le dijo que se fuera de vacaciones. La incompetencia suele pagarse con la dimisi\u00f3n, pero a la vista de c\u00f3mo Rajoy elige a los ministros cuando alguno se le va, no merece la pena pedir la de Ana Mato porque con Rajoy, incluso en este caso, todo es susceptible de empeorar.",
