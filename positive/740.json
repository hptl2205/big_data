For years, ex-CIA case officer Jeffrey Sterling was the one under indictment but prosecutors' primary focus of pursuit was journalist Jeffrey Risen.\n\nProsecutors believed Sterling leaked details to Risen about one of the government's most closely held secrets: a secret CIA mission to derail Iran's nuclear ambitions by giving them deliberately flawed blueprints.\n\nRisen, though, wouldn't divulge his sources. Prosecutors sought court orders forcing Risen to testify, saying their job would be immeasurably more difficult without his testimony.\n\nUltimately, though, prosecutors won their case without Risen. On Monday, Sterling was convicted in federal court on all nine charges he faced after a two-week trial in which Risen never made an appearance.\n\nExperts said the trial shows the government can pursue leak investigations without relying on recalcitrant reporters.\n\nAt issue in the two-week trial: Who told Risen about the mission, one that former national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testified was one of America's best chances to derail Iran's nuclear-weapons ambitions?\n\nThe case was delayed for years as prosecutors fought to force Risen to divulge his sources. Risen eventually lost his legal battle to quash a government subpoena. But prosecutors ultimately decided not to call him to testify after the Justice Department, bowing to pressure from free-press advocates, promised it would not ask Risen sensitive questions about his sources.\n\nLacking Risen's testimony, prosecutors acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling, 47, of O'Fallon, Missouri, but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming.\n\nDefense lawyers had said the evidence showed that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak.\n\nFollowing the verdict, defense lawyer Edward MacMahon said he was disappointed, but \"we still believe in Jeffrey's innocence.\" Sterling will have the option to appeal his case after he is sentenced in April. Motions to dismiss the case on various legal grounds are also still pending in front of the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema.\n\nLucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland's journalism school and former director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, said she was not surprised by the verdict, which followed days of testimony from CIA officials who testified without revealing their last names and from behind a gray screen that shielded their faces from the public. She called it groundbreaking in the sense that it showed how prosecutors are willing to pursue such cases without reporters' cooperation.\n\n\"They're going to use this case to terrify federal employees. They're going to use this case to teach the intelligence community a lesson\" about the consequences of leaks, she said.\n\nThe Obama administration has brought more leak cases than all of his predecessors combined. U.S. Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, who leaked more than 700,000 secret military and diplomatic documents to the WikiLeaks website, was convicted at a military trial and sentenced to military prison.\n\nOther cases were resolved before trial. Former CIA officer John Kiriakou pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in prison for disclosing to a reporter the name of an undercover agency officer. Thomas Drake, who worked for the National Security Agency, disclosed government waste and fraud to a reporter. He pleaded guilty to a minor charge and did not receive prison time.\n\nA former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, was charged with leaking to journalists but received asylum in Russia.\n\nGoing back earlier, Pentagon analyst Lawrence Franklin received a 12-year sentence after a guilty plea for leaking classified information to a reporter and two pro-Israel Lobbyists, though his sentence was later reduced significantly.\n\nThe classified operation at the heart of the Sterling trial involved using a CIA asset nicknamed Merlin, who had been a Russian nuclear engineer, to foist deliberately flawed nuclear-weapons blueprints on the Iranians, hoping they would spend years trying to develop parts that had no hope of ever working.\n\nRisen's 2006 book, \"State of War,\" describes the mission as hopelessly botched. Throughout the trial, though, numerous CIA officers testified they had deemed the program a success, even though the Iranians never followed up with Merlin to get additional blueprints he had offered to them as part of the ruse.\n\nProsecutors argued to the jury that the relevant chapter of Risen's book seemed to be clearly written from Sterling's perspective as Merlin's case handler. The book describes the handler's misgivings about the operation while others at the CIA pushed the plan through despite its risks.\n\nFurthermore, Sterling believed he had been mistreated and was angry that the agency refused to settle his racial-discrimination complaint, prosecutors said.\n\nAnd jurors were given phone and email records showing dozens of interactions between Sterling and Risen.\n\nBut defense lawyers said the government had no evidence that Risen and Sterling talked about anything classified in those phone calls and emails. The government failed to obtain Risen's records to see who else he may have contacted.\n\nDefense attorney Barry Pollack said Risen first got wind of the operation in early 2003, within weeks of Sterling reporting his misgivings to staffers at a Senate intelligence committee -- a channel Sterling was legally allowed to pursue. Pollack said it makes more sense that a Capitol Hill staffer leaked to Risen.\n\nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Dana Boente, in a written statement, described Sterling as \"a disgruntled former CIA employee\" and said the leak \"was illegal and went against Mr. Sterling's professional commitments to the CIA.\"\n\n\"Mr. Sterling's vindictive and careless choices ultimately led us here today and to this unanimous verdict.\"\n\nRisen did not return a call and email seeking comment.",

                    "body": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former CIA officer was convicted Monday of leaking details of a covert mission to derail Iran's nuclear program in a case that, until the eve of the trial, was as much about the journalist who published the leaks as it was the accused leaker.\n\nThe government gave up on its effort to force New York Times reporter James Risen to reveal his sources -- and ultimately didn't need him to win a conviction.\n\nJurors convicted Jeffrey Sterling, 47, of O'Fallon, Missouri, of all nine counts he faced in federal court.\n\nAt issue in the two-week trial: Who told Risen about the mission, one that former national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testified was among the government's most closely held secrets during her tenure as well as one of its best chances to derail Iran's nuclear-weapons ambitions?\n\nThe case was delayed for years as prosecutors fought to force Risen to divulge his sources. Risen eventually lost his legal battle to quash a government subpoena, though prosecutors ultimately decided not to call him to testify once it became clear he would not reveal those sources even if jailed for contempt of court and free-press advocates lobbied on Risen's behalf.\n\nProsecutors had acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming. Defense lawyers had said the evidence showed that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak.\n\nFollowing the verdict, defense lawyer Edward MacMahon said he is disappointed in the verdict but \"we still believe in Jeffrey's innocence.\" He said the defense will pursue every available legal option to get the jury's verdict overturned.\n\nSterling will have the option to appeal his case after he is sentenced in April. Motions to dismiss the case on various legal grounds are also still pending in front of the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema.\n\nThe classified operation at the heart of the trial involved using a CIA asset nicknamed Merlin, who had been a Russian nuclear engineer, to foist deliberately flawed nuclear-weapons blueprints on the Iranians, hoping they would spend years trying to develop parts that had no hope of ever working.\n\nRisen's 2006 book, \"State of War,\" describes the mission as hopelessly botched, and possibly backfiring by giving the Iranians blueprints that could be useful to them if they sorted out the good information from the errors.\n\nThroughout the trial, numerous CIA officers testified that they had deemed the program a success, even though the Iranians never followed up with Merlin to get additional blueprints he had offered to them as part of the ruse.\n\nIn his closing arguments, prosecutor Eric Olshan said the chapter of Risen's book seemed to be clearly written from Sterling's perspective as Merlin's case handler. The book describes the handler's misgivings about the operation while others at the CIA push the plan through despite its risks.\n\nFurthermore, Sterling believed he had been mistreated and was angry that the agency refused to settle his racial discrimination complaint, Olshan said.\n\nRisen had written about that complaint, and he was known to have a relationship with Sterling. The two exchanged dozens of phone calls and emails, Olshan said.\n\nBut defense lawyers said the government had no evidence that Risen and Sterling talked about anything classified in those phone calls and emails. The government failed to obtain Risen's records to see who else he may have contacted.\n\nDefense attorney Barry Pollack said Risen first got wind of the operation in early 2003, within weeks of Sterling reporting his misgivings to staffers at a Senate intelligence committee -- a channel that Sterling was legally allowed to pursue. Pollack said it makes more sense that a Hill staffer leaked to Risen.\n\nJust before lunch on Monday -- the jurors' third day of deliberations, they sent a note to the judge saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict on some counts. But after the judge urged them to keep talking, they delivered guilty verdicts later in the afternoon.\n\nJurors declined to comment leaving the courthouse.\n\nLucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland's journalism school and former director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, said she was not surprised by the verdict. She called it groundbreaking in the sense that it showed how prosecutors are willing to pursue such cases without reporters' cooperation.\n\n\"They're going to use this case to terrify federal employees. They're going to use this case to teach the intelligence community a lesson\" about the consequences of leaks, she said.",

                    "body": "A former CIA officer who was involved in a highly secretive operation to give faulty nuclear plans to Iran was convicted Monday of providing classified information about his work to a New York Times reporter -- a significant win for federal prosecutors and a presidential administration that has worked zealously to root out leakers.\n\nAs guilty verdicts were read on all nine criminal counts, Jeffrey Sterling stared emotionless at the jurors who decided his fate. His wife, seated in the courtroom behind him, sobbed.\n\nThe 47-year-old Missouri man is scheduled to be sentenced April 24 and remains free until then.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the verdict was a \"just and appropriate outcome.\"\n\n\"The disclosures placed lives at risk,\" Holder said. \"And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it.\"\n\nSterling was accused of a breach that ultimately closed off one of the few avenues the United States had to stem the development of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nBut the prosecution also was notable because it spawned a First Amendment confrontation between a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the Justice Department. And it might be one of the greatest courtroom successes of a presidential administration that has pursued more leak cases than all of its predecessors combined.\n\nJurors in U.S. District Court in Alexandria deliberated for one whole day and sizable parts of two others before reaching their verdict. Earlier Monday, they told the judge in a note that they could not come to an agreement on several counts.\n\nOther leak cases have resulted in pleas, at least one with terms favorable to the defendant. Former National Security Agency manager and accused leaker Thomas A. Drake pleaded to a reduced charge that called for no prison time. Prosecutors reached an agreement that brought a harsher penalty for former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who was sentenced to 2\u00bd years in prison for disclosing a covert operative's name to a reporter.\n\nFederal authorities are still considering charges against several high-profile individuals in other probes, including former CIA director David H. Petraeus, veteran State Department diplomat Robin Raphel and retired Marine Gen. James E. \"Hoss\" Cartwright.\n\nDan French, a former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York who now does white-collar work at Hiscock & Barclay, said no matter whether prosecutors had won or lost the Sterling case, they are likely to aggressively prosecute leaks they deem serious in the future.\n\n\"I just think they're going to bring these cases continuously to demonstrate that type of conduct by a government employee or a government contractor is going to be prosecuted, because the risk is just too grave,\" he said.\n\nSterling, who faced charges under the Espionage Act, was first accused in 2010 of giving classified information to New York Times reporter and author James Risen for his 2006 book, \"State of War.\" Prosecutors alleged -- and jurors apparently agreed -- that Sterling was trying to get revenge on the CIA when he talked to Risen about an operation meant to deter Iran's nuclear program.\n\nSterling, who was fired in the early 2000s, had sued the agency over alleged discrimination and also sparred with officials about publishing a memoir describing some of his work.\n\nThe case drew special attention when federal prosecutors initially sought to subpoena Risen to testify against his will. Though they won in court, the Justice Department ultimately decided not to put the reporter on the stand at the trial. Risen had vowed to go to jail before he would reveal any sources.\n\nThrough his attorney, Risen declined to comment for this article. Holder said in his statement that the verdict proved \"it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs.\" Since his department's legal battles with Risen, Holder has tightened the guidelines governing investigations that involve journalists.\n\nThe trial itself was something of a spectacle, with CIA officers testifying behind a retractable gray screen as they described suitcases full of cash, clandestine meetings and fictitious back stories. The case against Sterling was largely circumstantial -- there were no recorded phone conversations or captured e-mail exchanges that show that he leaked classified information to Risen -- and that required prosecutors' to delve deeply into Sterling's work and the details of Risen's book.\n\nBy prosecutors' account, Sterling was the only potential source who had a relationship with Risen, knew all of the information from the chapter at issue and had a motive to discuss his clandestine work. They argued that the book -- which suggested that the secret operation might actually have helped further Iran's nuclear research -- was somewhat inaccurate and that it cast Sterling as a hero and the CIA as hapless.\n\n\"Jeffrey Sterling's spin is what appears in the book,\" prosecutor Eric Olshan said.\n\nDefense attorneys posited several people other than Sterling who could have served as Risen's sources, and they suggested Sterling was unlikely to have given the reporter any information. They argued that some information in the book could not have come from Sterling, because it addressed things that happened after he left the CIA or contained details that he would not have known or remembered.\n\nSterling defense attorney Barry Pollack said after the hearing that attorneys plan to take the case to a higher court.\n\n\"This is a sad day for Mr. Sterling and his wife,\" Pollack said. \"We will pursue all legal avenues with the trial court and on appeal to challenge Mr. Sterling's conviction.\"",

Former CIA agent Jeffrey Sterling leaked information about an operation to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. Jurors convicted Sterling, 47, of O'Fallon, Missouri, of all nine counts he faced in federal court.\n\nOn the third day of deliberations, the jurors had told the judge that they could not reach a unanimous verdict, but they delivered guilty verdicts later in the afternoon after the judge urged them to keep talking.\n\nAt issue in the two-week trial: Who told journalist James Risen about the secret mission, one that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified was one of the government's most closely held secrets as well as one of its best chances to thwart Iran's nuclear-weapons ambitions?\n\nThe case was delayed for years as prosecutors fought to force Risen to divulge his sources, though they ultimately decided not to call him to testify once it became clear he would not reveal those sources even if jailed for convicted of contempt of court.\n\nProsecutors had acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against the convicted ex-CIA agent but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming. Defense lawyers had said the evidence showed that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak.\n\nThe plan involved using a CIA asset nicknamed Merlin, who had been a Russian nuclear engineer, to foist deliberately flawed nuclear-weapons blueprints on the Iranians, hoping they would spend years trying to develop parts that had no hope of ever working.\n\nRisen's 2006 book, \"State of War,\" describes the mission as hopelessly botched, and possibly backfiring by giving the Iranians blueprints that could be useful to them if they sorted out the good information from the errors.\n\nIn his closing arguments, prosecutor Eric Olshan said the chapter of Risen's book seemed to be clearly written from Sterling's perspective as Merlin's case handler. The book describes the handler's misgivings about the operation while others at the CIA push the plan through despite its risks.\n\nFurthermore, the convicted ex-CIA agent believed he had been mistreated and was angry that the agency refused to settle his racial discrimination complaint, Olshan said.\n\nRisen had written about that complaint, and he was known to have a relationship with the convicted ex-CIA agent. The two exchanged dozens of phone calls and emails, Olshan said.\n\nBut defense lawyers said the government had no evidence that Risen and Sterling talked about anything classified in those phone calls and emails. The government failed to obtain Risen's records to see who else he may have contacted.\n\nDefense attorney Barry Pollack said Risen first got wind of the operation in early 2003, within weeks of Sterling reporting his misgivings to staffers at a Senate intelligence committee -- a channel that the convicted ex-CIA agent was legally allowed to pursue. Pollack said it makes more sense that a Hill staffer leaked to Risen.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer, was convicted of espionage Monday on charges that he told a reporter for The New York Times about a secret operation to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe conviction is a significant victory for the Obama administration, which has conducted an unprecedented crackdown on officials who speak to journalists about security matters without the administration's approval. Prosecutors prevailed after a years-long fight in which the reporter, James Risen, refused to identify his sources.\n\nThe case revolved around a CIA operation in which a former Russian scientist provided Iran with intentionally flawed nuclear component schematics. Mr. Risen revealed the operation in his 2006 book, \"State of War,\" describing it as a mismanaged, potentially reckless mission that may have inadvertently aided the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nOn the third day of deliberations, the jury in federal court in Alexandria, Va., convicted Mr. Sterling on nine felony counts. Mr. Sterling, 47, who worked for the CIA from 1993 to 2002 and now lives in O'Fallon, Mo., faces a maximum possible sentence of decades in prison, although the actual sentence is likely to be far shorter. U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema, who presided over the weeklong trial, allowed Mr. Sterling to remain free on bond and set sentencing for April 24.\n\n\"This is a just and appropriate outcome,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said. \"The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it. As this verdict proves, it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs.\"\n\nEdward MacMahon Jr., Mr. Sterling's lawyer, said he would seek to get the verdict thrown out and, failing that, file an appeal.\n\n\"We're obviously very saddened by the jury's verdict,\" Mr. MacMahon said in a telephone interview. \"We continue to believe in Jeffrey's innocence, and we're going to continue to fight for him up to the highest levels.\"\n\nBruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, an advocacy organization for journalists, said the Sterling conviction showed that forcing reporters to identify their confidential sources was unnecessary and ill-advised.\n\n\"The speed with which the jury reached its verdict shows that reporter's testimony was not needed for the government to make its case,\" Mr. Brown said. \"I think going forward this is going to be a powerful precedent.\"\n\nLiberal advocacy groups have hailed Mr. Sterling as a whistle-blower for taking his concerns about the program to the Senate Intelligence Committee in early 2003, a time when dissenting voices in the CIA were hushed as the country prepared for war in Iraq. The Justice Department and CIA, however, deny that characterization. They said the Iran operation was not mismanaged and said Mr. Sterling went to Congress and then the media as a way to settle personal grievances.\n\nThe Justice Department had no direct proof that Mr. Sterling, who managed the Iranian operation, provided the information to Mr. Risen, but prosecutors stitched together a strong circumstantial case. They described Mr. Sterling, who is black, as bitter and frustrated about what he believed was workplace discrimination. Telephone records and emails showed that Mr. Sterling and Mr. Risen talked frequently, and prosecutors argued that only Mr. Sterling had the information, the motive and the opportunity to leak it.\n\n\"The defendant put his own selfishness and his own vindictiveness ahead of the American people,\" Eric Olshan, a federal prosecutor, said during closing arguments Thursday. \"For what? He hated the CIA and he wanted to settle the score.\"\n\nThe trial was part Washington spectacle, part cloak and dagger. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified, as did CIA operatives who gave only their first names and last initials, with their faces shielded behind 7-foot-high partitions. A scientist was referred to only by his code name, Merlin. His wife was Mrs. Merlin.\n\nOfficials revealed their preferred strategies for persuading reporters not to run sensitive stories. Jurors learned that, at the CIA's office in New York City, employees could easily walk out with classified documents and never be searched.\n\nMr. Sterling's lawyers said the government's case was based entirely on suspicion.\n\n\"The government has great lawyers,\" said Barry Pollack, a defense lawyer. \"It has a great theory. It just made a great argument. What the government lacks is evidence.\"\n\nMr. Sterling's lawyers argued that it was just as likely that Mr. Risen learned about the operation from Capitol Hill staff members, then pieced together details from other sources at the CIA and from the Russian scientist himself. Mr. Pollack acknowledged that Mr. Sterling had a relationship with Mr. Risen but said they talked only about Mr. Sterling's discrimination lawsuit against the CIA. Mr. Risen probably asked about the Iranian operation, Mr. Pollack said, but Mr. Sterling did not provide any information.\n\nMr. Sterling is the latest in a string of former officials and contractors that the Obama administration has charged with discussing national security matters with reporters. Under all previous presidents combined, three people had faced such prosecutions. Under Obama, there have been eight cases, and journalists have complained that the crackdown has discouraged officials from discussing even unclassified security matters.\n\nMost of those charged since 2009 have pleaded guilty and avoided a trial. Of those, John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer, is in federal prison, as are two former government contractors, Donald Sachtleben and Stephen Kim. Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency official, cut a deal on a minor charge and avoided serving time.\n\nThe only other trial was the military court-martial of Chelsea Manning, the Army private formerly known as Bradley Manning, who was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for providing a trove of government documents to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization.\n\nThe most prominent leak case, however, remains open. Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor who downloaded and provided journalists with thousands of that agency's documents, has fled to Russia to avoid criminal charges. Those documents revealed a domestic surveillance program in which the NSA monitored the phone records of every American.\n\nWhile the administration has defended the crackdown, Mr. Holder said he believed it went too far at times when it targeted journalists. Under Mr. Holder, prosecutors seized phone records from The Associated Press, labeled one Fox News reporter a potential criminal co-conspirator for inquiring about classified information and tried to force another to testify before a grand jury.\n\nMr. Risen's lengthy fight to avoid testifying about his sources turned the case into a rallying point for news organizations, which said the Justice Department had made it harder to cover national security beyond what it released in news statements and approved leaks, such as those that told a glowing story about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Less favorable stories, such as those revealing warrantless wiretapping or secret prisons, led to criminal investigations.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear Mr. Risen's case, meaning he would have been forced to testify, and if he refused, he could have been put in jail. But Mr. Holder, in a reversal, said prosecutors would not force him to reveal his sources. With that option off the table, prosecutors opted not to call Mr. Risen to testify during the trial.",

Prosecutor Eric Olshan argued in court that these criticisms matched up with Sterling's own view of the mission, and portrayed the CIA as unresponsive to potential risks.\n\n\"The only person who comes out smelling like roses in Mr. Risen's telling is Jeffrey Sterling,\" Olshan said.\n\nThe former CIA officer, who was fired in the early 2000s, was convicted of nine counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information and other related charges.

Jury finds Sterling guilty on all 9 counts.\n\n-- Manuel Rapalo (@Manuel_Rapalo) January 26, 2015\n\nEarlier on Monday, jurors told the judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on several of the charges. Brinkema told them to keep deliberating, however, and they returned with a decision mere hours later.\n\nSterling was the fifth person in US history to be charged with mishandling national defense information under the Espionage Act.\n\nThe conviction is a significant victory for the Obama administration, the New York Times reported. Despite promises to be \"the most transparent administration ever,\" the executive branch has led an unprecedented crackdown on whistleblowers and those who leak information about national security matters to journalists without government approval.\n\nOlshan and the prosecution painted Sterling as a disgruntled employee who leaked the information because of unrelated grievances stemming from a racial discrimination complaint filed by Sterling, who is African American, against the CIA.\n\n\"He felt he'd been mistreated,\" Olshan said. \"He was angry. He was bitter. He was done keeping the CIA's secrets.\"\n\n\"The defendant put his own selfishness and his own vindictiveness ahead of the American people,\" Olshan also said during closing arguments Thursday. \"For what? He hated the CIA and he wanted to settle the score.\"\n\nSterling's defense attorney, Barry Pollack, rebutted these claims by highlighting the fact that government failed to produce any direct evidence linking his client to Risen's account in \"State of War.\"\n\n\"The government has great lawyers. It has a great theory. It just made a great argument,\" Pollack said. \"What the government lacks is evidence.\"\n\nWhile prosecutors showed that Risen and Sterling contacted one another dozens of times, Pollack said that nothing the government presented to the jury showed that the two had discussed any classified information. Defense attorneys argued that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the operation were more likely to be the source of the leak because some of the information in Risen's book addressed things that happened after Sterling left the CIA, the Washington Post reported.\n\nEarlier in the trial, a CIA manager testified that more than 90 people in the government knew about the covert Iran mission.\n\nThe trial of former CIA officer #JeffreySterling is now in the hands of jurors.

Risen fought subpoenas from two presidential administrations - those of George W. Bush and Barack Obama - but eventually lost his case in court. When he appeared in court under oath, however, Risen refused to answer any questions about his source, and the Justice Department decided not to ask him to testify.\n\nThe trial lasted seven days, with CIA agents sneaking into the courtroom to testify behind grey screens so as not to reveal their identities.

                    "body": "Jeffrey Sterling, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, was convicted of espionage charges Monday, for telling a journalist for The New York Times about a secret operation to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe conviction is a significant victory for the Obama administration, which has led an unprecedented crackdown on officials who speak to journalists about security matters without the administration's approval. Prosecutors prevailed after a years-long fight in which the journalist, James Risen, refused to identify his sources.\n\nThe case revolved around a CIA operation in which a former Russian scientist provided Iran with intentionally flawed nuclear component schematics. Mr. Risen revealed the operation in his 2006 book State of War, describing it as a mismanaged, potentially reckless mission that may have inadvertently aided the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nMr. Sterling faces years in prison.\n\nLiberal advocacy groups have hailed Mr. Sterling as a whistle-blower for taking his concerns about the program to the Senate intelligence committee in early 2003, a time when dissenting voices in the CIA were hushed as the country prepared for war in Iraq. The Justice Department and CIA, however, deny that characterization. They said the Iran operation was not mismanaged and said Mr. Sterling went to Congress and then the news media as a way to settle personal grievances.\n\nMr. Sterling managed the Iranian operation. The Justice Department had no direct proof that Mr. Sterling provided the information to Mr. Risen, but prosecutors stitched together a strong circumstantial case. They described Mr. Sterling, who is black, as bitter and frustrated about what he believed was workplace discrimination. Telephone records and e-mails showed that Mr. Sterling and Mr. Risen talked frequently, and prosecutors argued that only Mr. Sterling had the information, the motive and the opportunity to leak it.\n\n\"The defendant put his own selfishness and his own vindictiveness ahead of the American people,\" Eric Olshan, a federal prosecutor, said during closing arguments Thursday. \"For what? He hated the CIA and he wanted to settle the score.\"\n\nThe trial was part Washington spectacle, part cloak and dagger. Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice testified, as did CIA operatives who gave only their first names and last initials, with their faces shielded behind seven-foot-high partitions. A scientist was referred to by only his code name, Merlin. His wife was Mrs. Merlin.\n\nOfficials revealed their preferred strategies for persuading reporters not to run sensitive stories. Also revealed was that, at the CIA's office in New York, employees could easily walk out with classified documents and never be searched.\n\nMr. Sterling's lawyers said the government's case was based entirely on suspicion. \"The government has great lawyers. It has a great theory. It just made a great argument,\" said Barry Pollack, a defence lawyer. \"What the government lacks is evidence.\"\n\nMr. Sterling's lawyers argued that it was just as likely that Mr. Risen learned about the operation from Capitol Hill staff members, then pieced together details from other sources at the CIA and from the Russian scientist himself. Mr. Pollack acknowledged that Mr. Sterling had a relationship with Mr. Risen, but said they talked only about Mr. Sterling's discrimination lawsuit against the CIA. Mr. Risen probably asked about Merlin and the Iranian operation, Mr. Pollack said, but Mr. Sterling did not provide any information.\n\nMr. Sterling is the latest in a string of former officials and contractors the Obama administration has charged with discussing national security matters with reporters. Most, however, have pleaded guilty and avoided a trial. Of those, John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer, is in federal prison, as are two former government contractors, Donald Sachtleben and Stephen Kim. Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency official, cut a deal on minor charges and avoided serving time.\n\nThe only other trial was the court-martial of Chelsea Manning, the army private formerly known as Bradley Manning, who was convicted and sentenced to prison for providing a trove of government documents to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe most prominent leak case, however, remains open. Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor who downloaded and provided journalists with thousands of that agency's documents, has fled to Russia to avoid criminal charges. Those documents revealed a domestic surveillance program in which the NSA monitored the phone records of every American.\n\nWhile the administration has defended the crackdown, Attorney-General Eric Holder said he believed it went too far at times when it targeted journalists. Under Mr. Holder, prosecutors seized phone records from The Associated Press, labelled one Fox News reporter a potential criminal co-conspirator for inquiring about classified information and tried to force another to testify before a grand jury.\n\nMr. Risen's lengthy fight to avoid testifying about his sources turned the case into a rallying point for news organizations who said the Justice Department had made it harder to cover national security beyond what it released in news statements and sanctioned leaks, such as those that told a glowing story about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Less favourable stories, such as those revealing warrantless wiretapping or secret prisons, led to criminal investigations.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear Mr. Risen's case, meaning he would have been forced to testify, and if he refused, he could have been put in jail. But Attorney-General Eric Holder, in a reversal, said prosecutors would not force him to reveal his sources. With that option off the table, prosecutors opted not to call Mr. Risen to testify during the trial.New York Times News Service",

Risen refused to disclose the names of any of his anonymous sources.\n\nProsecutors claimed that Sterling disclosed the classified information in an attempt to get back at the CIA after he was fired from the agency.\n\nDespite lacking any record of phone calls or emails between Sterling and Risen, the prosecution was able to secure a guilty verdict after it argued that Sterling was the only person with knowledge of the covert program described in Risen's book to know Risen and with a motive to disclose the classified information.\n\nProsecutors argued that Sterling's disclosure damaged American efforts to halt Iran's nuclear weapons program and put lives at risk.\n\nThe New York Times famously decided not to publish Risen's story on the covert program at the urging of top officials in President George W. Bush's administration who claimed the story would damage U.S. national security.

                    "body": "A federal court jury found former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling guilty on nine felony counts Monday stemming from the leak of a top-secret CIA operation to a New York Times reporter.\n\nSterling's trial in Alexandria, Virginia, was the first of its kind in nearly three decades and resulted in a somewhat unexpected courtroom triumph for the government given the circumstantial nature of the prosecution's evidence.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe convictions, which came after a hard-fought case, are a blow to critics of the flurry of prosecutions the Obama administration has instituted against defendants accused or suspected of leaking classified information to the media. Nine such cases have been filed since President Barack Obama took office -- triple the number under all previous administrations combined.\n\nThe jury returned its verdict on the third day of deliberations following a seven-day trial. The decision came just hours after the jury reported it could not agree on some of the counts.\n\nSterling showed no emotion as the nine guilty verdicts were read, but his wife burst into tears and began sobbing loudly as a courtroom clerk announced the jury's conclusion. At the direction of U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema, a courtroom marshal asked Sterling's wife to control herself, but she continued sobbing and crying out.\n\n\"I can't. It's my husband,\" she said to the marshal.\n\nOnly a couple of jurors looked directly at the defendant as they filed into the courtroom. Most also diverted their eyes as Sterling's overcome wife drew the attention of other onlookers.\n\nBrinkema allowed Sterling to remain free on bond pending sentencing set for April 24.\n\nIn theory, Sterling could receive up to 100 years in prison. However, judges usually sentence in accordance with federal guidelines that call for substantially shorter prison terms in most cases.\n\nThe investigation arose after Times national security reporter James Risen began making calls to government spokespeople in 2003 about a CIA operation aimed at undermining Iran's nuclear program.\n\nRisen said he'd learned that the program involved transmitting flawed nuclear weapons designs to the Iranian government via a Russian nuclear engineer working undercover for the U.S. spy agency, but the journalist also said some privy to the program believed the flaws were too obvious and might have ultimately benefited Iran's nuclear efforts.\n\nThe Times killed the story at the request of senior officials in President George W. Bush's White House, including then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. The standout celebrity witness at the trial testified that she intervened to try to halt the story at the direct instruction of the president.\n\nRisen, however, published an account of the CIA operation in his 2006 book \"State of War.\" The publication apparently reanimated the government's investigation of the leak and led to Sterling's indictment in 2010.\n\nRisen mounted a seven-year legal battle against demands that he identify his confidential sources for the book. Brinkema found him protected by reporter's privilege, but a federal appeals court disagreed and the Supreme Court declined his request to take up the case.\n\nThat left Risen with virtually no protection against being forced to identify his sources, although he vowed he would never do so.\n\nThe standoff was resolved earlier this month when Attorney General Eric Holder dropped the demand that Risen testify about his sources. Instead, the attorney general said the journalist could only be asked to reaffirm the general accuracy of his work and that it was based on sources he was unwilling to identify.\n\nRisen gave that testimony, grudgingly, at a pre-trial hearing earlier this month. But prosecutors ultimately decided not to call the journalist as a witness. Instead, with the consent of the defense, jurors were given a general summary of his brief testimony.\n\nThat left the government to prove their cases solely through circumstantial evidence: records of 47 phone calls between Sterling and Risen (or someone else at the Times) and traces of email contacts between Sterling and the Times reporter. Prosecutors also made much of the fact that Risen wrote an article in 2002 about a racial discrimination case the African-American CIA officer filed against the spy agency.\n\nThe prosecution argued that Sterling was angry over the CIA's refusal to settle the lawsuit and consequently leaked the information about the Iran program to Risen. Prosecutors also noted that when he was fired from the spy agency, Sterling refused to reaffirm his oath to protect the CIA's secrets.\n\nThe defense contended that all the prosecution's inferences amounted to suspicion and not evidence proving Sterling guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on charges of conveying national defense information to those unauthorized to received it, retaining such information without permission, illegally conveying government property and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe defense argued that the case was particularly weak when it came to venue, the requirement that prosecutors prove that each crime was committed, at least in part, in the eastern portion of Virginia. However, the prosecution's burden on that point was lower than the usual reasonable doubt standard. The government only had to prove that it was more likely than not that part of the crime took place in that area of Virginia, where Sterling lived before moving to Missouri.\n\nUnusual security measures were implemented during the trial. A string of witnesses from the CIA testified from behind a pair of tall screens. The dividers allowed the lawyers, Sterling, the judge and the jury to see the witnesses, but most onlookers were required to sit in a portion of the public gallery where their view was blocked.\n\nMany of the witnesses were also identified solely by their first name and last initial. In addition, jurors were told by the judge never to discuss three exhibits that remain classified.\n\nBefore the jury began deliberating, Brinkema tossed out one count in the 10-count indictment: a mail fraud charge stemming from the shipment of Risen's book to Virginia.\n\nDefense attorneys had no immediate comment on the verdicts, but Holder and FBI Director James Comey hailed the result.\n\n\"This is a just and appropriate outcome,\" Holder said in a statement thanking prosecutors and investigators for their efforts. \"The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it.\"\n\nComey said Sterling \"violated his sworn duty to protect our nation's secrets and he betrayed our country.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Dana Boente echoed prosecutors comments at trial branding Sterling as \"a disgruntled former CIA employee\" whose \"vindictive and careless choices\" led to the disclosure of national secrets.\n\nRisen had no comment on the trial's outcome, one of his lawyers said Monday afternoon.",

Sterling of nine felony counts for giving a reporter details of a highly classified U.S. operation designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe conviction, after two days of deliberations, brought an end to a major confrontation between the Obama administration and the press over First Amendment rights in national security cases.\n\nOver the last six years, the Justice Department pursued New York Times reporter and author James Risen all the way to the Supreme Court in an effort to force him to testify against Sterling.\n\nRisen published details of what he described as a botched CIA operation against Iran in his 2006 book \"State of War.\" He argued that the effort may have backfired - and given Iran valuable nuclear information.\n\nThe verdict followed a cloak-and-dagger trial in which CIA officers and a former Russian nuclear engineer identified only as \"Merlin\" testified behind a screen to hide their faces, and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told the court how she had convinced editors at The New York Times to kill a proposed newspaper story about the secret operation in 2003.\n\nWhen prosecutors sought to force Risen to say who had leaked the material, he refused and lost in the courts. But he ultimately was not forced to reveal his sources after an outcry over the administration's pursuit of him and other reporters pressured Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to order prosecutors to back off.\n\nThe guilty verdict \"shows it's possible to prosecute unauthorized disclosures without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs,\" Holder said in a statement.\n\n\"The disclosures placed lives at risk,\" Holder added. \"And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it.\"\n\nBruce D.

The suit was dismissed on national security grounds and Sterling was fired.\n\nAt his weeklong trial in Alexandria, Va., prosecutors said Sterling had leaked classified information to Risen out of bitterness.",

                    "body": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- For years, ex-CIA case officer Jeffrey Sterling was the one under indictment but prosecutors' primary focus of pursuit was journalist Jeffrey Risen.\n\nProsecutors believed Sterling leaked details to Risen about one of the government's most closely held secrets: a secret CIA mission to derail Iran's nuclear ambitions by giving them deliberately flawed blueprints.\n\nRisen, though, wouldn't divulge his sources. Prosecutors sought court orders forcing Risen to testify, saying their job would be immeasurably more difficult without his testimony.\n\nUltimately, though, prosecutors won their case without Risen. On Monday, Sterling was convicted in federal court on all nine charges he faced after a two-week trial in which Risen never made an appearance.\n\nExperts said the trial shows the government can pursue leak investigations without relying on recalcitrant reporters.\n\nAt issue in the two-week trial: Who told Risen about the mission, one that former national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testified was one of America's best chances to derail Iran's nuclear-weapons ambitions?\n\nThe case was delayed for years as prosecutors fought to force Risen to divulge his sources. Risen eventually lost his legal battle to quash a government subpoena. But prosecutors ultimately decided not to call him to testify after the Justice Department, bowing to pressure from free-press advocates, promised it would not ask Risen sensitive questions about his sources.\n\nLacking Risen's testimony, prosecutors acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling, 47, of O'Fallon, Missouri, but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming.\n\nDefense lawyers had said the evidence showed that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak.\n\nFollowing the verdict, defense lawyer Edward MacMahon said he was disappointed, but \"we still believe in Jeffrey's innocence.\" Sterling will have the option to appeal his case after he is sentenced in April. Motions to dismiss the case on various legal grounds are also still pending in front of the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema.\n\nLucy Dalglish, dean of the University of Maryland's journalism school and former director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press, said she was not surprised by the verdict, which followed days of testimony from CIA officials who testified without revealing their last names and from behind a gray screen that shielded their faces from the public. She called it groundbreaking in the sense that it showed how prosecutors are willing to pursue such cases without reporters' cooperation.\n\n\"They're going to use this case to terrify federal employees. They're going to use this case to teach the intelligence community a lesson\" about the consequences of leaks, she said.\n\nThe Obama administration has brought more leak cases than all of his predecessors combined. U.S. Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, who leaked more than 700,000 secret military and diplomatic documents to the WikiLeaks website, was convicted at a military trial and sentenced to military prison.\n\nOther cases were resolved before trial. Former CIA officer John Kiriakou pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in prison for disclosing to a reporter the name of an undercover agency officer. Thomas Drake, who worked for the National Security Agency, disclosed government waste and fraud to a reporter. He pleaded guilty to a minor charge and did not receive prison time.\n\nA former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, was charged with leaking to journalists but received asylum in Russia.\n\nGoing back earlier, Pentagon analyst Lawrence Franklin received a 12-year sentence after a guilty plea for leaking classified information to a reporter and two pro-Israel Lobbyists, though his sentence was later reduced significantly.",

                    "body": "To hear the prosecution side tell it in the ongoing trial of Jeffrey Sterling, the former CIA officer who is accused of a national security leak involving Iran, Sterling has potentially (emphasis on potentially):\n\n* placed a CIA \"asset\" at risk;\n\n* hurt recruitment of other defectors, informants and turncoats;\n\n* scared other current \"assets\" into having second thoughts about remaining as assets;\n\n* tipped off the Iranians and the Russians and other nations that the CIA carries out clandestine schemes to disrupt other countries' nuclear weapons programs;\n\n* possibly caused the U.S. to modify its own nuclear weapons plans, and, well, you get the picture.\n\nSterling's alleged actions -- he is accused of providing New York Times reporter James Risen with classified information on a super-secret CIA scam, Operation Merlin, involving delivering flawed nuclear weapons plans to the Iranians in Vienna -- also could \"conceivably contribute to the deaths of millions of innocent victims.\"\n\nOr so said the CIA in talking points prepared for then-National Security Adviser and Hyperbolist-in-Chief Condoleezza Rice for a meeting with New York Times personnel in April 2003 in a successful effort to kill Risen's story about Merlin. Risen subsequently reported the botched Iranian nuclear plan in his 2006 book \"State of War,\" much to the embarrassment of the CIA (and the New York Times editors who had killed his original piece).\n\nAll these dire warnings were delivered ominously by federal prosecutors in opening and closing arguments, by current and former CIA personnel, a former FBI counterintelligence officer and other national security officials. The case is now being deliberated by the jury.\n\nThere is only one thing wrong with the prosecution's narrative about the dire consequences caused by James Risen's book and Sterling's alleged leaks -- it is almost completely evidence-free.\n\nPressed by defense attorneys over the last two weeks, the various employees of the national security state could cite no one who had been killed or hurt as a result of the disclosures in Risen's book, which came out nine years ago -- more than enough time for the predicted cataclysm to occur.\n\nNo examples of prospective \"assets\" who had said no-thanks because of the Risen disclosures. No example of even one current asset who had quit over the disclosures. No alteration of U.S. nuclear weapons plans. And, no, Condi Rice, no one has yet been killed by non-existent Iranian nuclear weapons or in that scary mushroom cloud you falsely warned us about in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of WMD-free Iraq.\n\nTypical this week was the testimony of former CIA official David Shedd, currently the acting director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, who pointed to many dire potential results of the Risen book's now-aging disclosures. He called the leak \"a breach of security that potentially would affect similar operations,\" and warned that such a leak \"could require modification\" of U.S. nuclear plans -- apparently because the bogus plans had good stuff in them that, warts and all, provided tips about the U.S. program. Which only underscores the craziness: If there is good stuff in the flawed plans, why would you want to peddle them to Iran or any other country you consider an adversary?\n\nFor the government's case, of course, it is enough to talk of potential harm rather than actual harm to national security, something prosecutor Eric Olshan did so skillfully in his closing argument. Add to that the factor of a lot of intelligence community people telling the jury that we all should be more than a little frightened because a cockamamie, dangerous CIA plot was exposed. That helps sweeten the pot, and could be enough to persuade some jurors despite the absence of facts. And have a Bush administration superstar like Condi Rice spin more tall tales about WMDs, this time in Iran. When you don't have evidence in a national security whistleblowing case, scare them.\n\nAnd evidence, beyond the circumstantial and an impressive (if incomplete) chronology that shows Risen and Sterling contacting each other frequently in phone calls during key periods, was sorely lacking.\n\nWith defense attorney Edward MacMahon masterfully picking apart some of the key testimony of prosecution witnesses this week, these witnesses were forced to admit they have found no evidence that it was Sterling who gave Risen a document for his book; or that it was Sterling who gave Risen any information about anything in his book; or that anyone had ever seen Risen and Sterling together; or that Sterling took home or otherwise purloined documents relating to Operation Merlin.\n\nAnd MacMahon and fellow defense attorney Barry Pollack have also demonstrated that there are multiple other possible sources for the leak of the Merlin materials but none was investigated.These include the Russian scientist who actually dropped off the flawed nuclear plans for pick-up by an Iranian official in Vienna, other CIA officials, and various staffers of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee (to whom Sterling had legally gone in 2003 as a whistleblower to voice his concerns over Merlin). Pollack, in closing arguments, demonstrated there was a significant number of people who could have been sources for Risen, including the 90 CIA employees that government testimony showed had access to the Merlin program\n\nFBI special agent Ashley Hunt, who has led the FBI investigation of the Merlin leak for more than a decade, presented the strongest circumstantial evidence against Sterling -- the aforementioned chronology. MacMahon got her to acknowledge that she did not pursue -- or was blocked from pursuing -- certain paths of inquiry that might have turned up other suspects as the source of the Merlin information that Risen received.\n\nHunt acknowledged under tough questioning that she had once earlier in the investigation written memoranda saying Sterling was probably not the leaker and that the likely source was someone from the Senate Select Intelligence Committee (SSIC). She also acknowledged writing a memo in early 2006 citing \"unified opposition\" to her investigation within the committee, which was supposed to be monitoring Merlin. She testified that then-committee chairman Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) told her he was not going to cooperate with the FBI, and the committee staff director, Republican William Duhnke, refused to talk to her at all.\n\nTwo former staffers from the SSIC who met with Sterling in March 2003, when he brought what they and other prosecution witnesses have described as a whistleblowing complaint about the Merlin scheme, did testify as prosecution witnesses at Sterling's trial. Under questioning, they provided testimony helpful to Sterling that showed that Risen, indeed, apparently had sources on the committee -- a committee that was already familiar with Operation Merlin even before Sterling came to them with his concerns.\n\nOne former staffer, Donald Stone, even acknowledged in his testimony that he had taken a call from Risen sometime after that meeting with Sterling, but that he had told him he couldn't talk to the press. Stone said he had not provided Risen with any information on any subject ever.\n\nThe other former staffer, Vicki Divoll, was fired from the committee after providing non-classified information to a Judiciary Committee staffer on a contentious intelligence authorization bill matter, only to see that information (which was embarrassing to the Republicans) trumpeted the next day in a front-page New York Times story written by -- James Risen. She testified she had never spoken to Risen on any matter, but that others on the committee had dealt with Risen from time to time.\n\nDivoll acknowledged telling the FBI at one point that Alfred Cumming, the committee's Democratic staff director, had spoken to Risen on occasion. She also testified she had heard during her committee tenure -- but had no direct knowledge -- that both the Democratic and Republican staff directors on the committee talked to reporters on various matters, and that both officials sometimes gave reporters information they wanted in a quid-pro-quo arrangement in which the reporter would also agree to write a story that the committee official wanted. She said this was very much \"third-hand\" information, maybe even \"fifth-hand.\"\n\nDefense attorneys hammered on the point through testimony from these prosecution witnesses that despite Risen's sources and potential sources in both the CIA and on Capitol Hill (including right on the SSCI), none had had their residences searched, their computer's contents analyzed, their telephone call logs examined, their bank and credit card records searched -- as had been the case with Sterling.\n\nAs part of the defense's counter-narrative, Pollack said in his closing arguments: \"They have a theory, I have a theory.\" But, he added, a jury should not convict or acquit someone on the basis of theories in such a serious case. Rather, he said, it was the government's responsibility to present evidence showing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and \"they haven't done it.\"\n\nFor much of this trial, the courtroom has been awash in reasonable doubt. Of course, jurors could choose to infer from the prosecution's chronology of circumstantial evidence that Sterling was, in fact, one of Risen's sources. And some of them could be scared enough by the government's narrative to believe the \"State of War\" disclosures made us less safe. In the government's rebuttal to Pollack's closing argument, prosecutor James Trump played the terrorism and treason cards, in case jurors had missed the message earlier. Sterling had \"betrayed his country...betrayed the CIA...\", in contrast to CIA employees who \"serve and we rest easier as a result.\"\n\nGiven the flimsiness of the case presented against Sterling, it would be a tragic miscarriage of justice if he were to be convicted and face a long prison sentence on the basis of nothing more than inferences -- and the fears of nuclear nightmares the government says can ensue because of the Operation Merlin disclosures.",

After threatening to compel Risen to testify, however, prosecutors ultimately won Sterling's conviction in federal court in Alexandria, Va. without calling the journalist as a witness and without providing direct evidence that Sterling was Risen's source. Rather, they strung together years of evidence of the relationship between the men in a circumstantial case.\n\nSterling was convicted of six counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information and one count each of unlawful retention of national defense information, unauthorized conveyance of government property and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe outcome was a big victory for the Obama administration, which has aggressively sought to crack down on the so-called insider threat -- leaks to the news media about classified government programs. Other leaks revealed the National Security Agency's massive collection of metadata on Americans' phone and email communications.\n\nBut while civil liberties and watchdog groups contended that Sterling was a whistleblower at a time when the Bush administration ramping up plans to go to war with Iraq, prosecutors said the operation that Sterling oversaw was not bungled and didn't warrant exposing.\n\n\"This is a just and appropriate outcome,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said following the verdict. \"The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public gtrust by someone who had sworn to uphold it.\"\n\nHe also said that the outcome showed \"it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs.\"\n\nFBI Director James Comey's words were at least as harsh: \"He violated his sworn duty to protect our nation's secrets and he betrayed our country.\"\n\nSterling worked for the CIA from May 1993 to January 2002. The Justice Department disclosed during the trial that from November 1998 through May 2000, he was assigned to a clandestine program designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program, a role in which he handled a human asset who was identified only as \"Merlin\" during the trial.\n\nIn May 2000, Sterling was reassigned and no longer was authorized to receive or possess classified information.\n\nDespite pledging in security, secrecy and non-disclosure agreements never to disclose classified information to unauthorized persons, the government alleged, he leaked secret information about the program, prosecutors charged. They said that he ignored the proper route for airing concerns about possibly improper conduct when classified information is involved.\n\nThe government's evidence included records of phone calls that Sterling made in February and March 2003 to Risen's home and the fact that he emailed a newspaper article about the weapons capabilities of a certain country that had been part of his operational assignment. Prosecutors also presented evidence that Sterling and Risen remained in touch from December 2003 through November 2005 through telephone and email. Risen's book was published in January 2006.\n\nAlthough he was aware of a grand jury investigation into the leak by June 2006 when he was served a subpoena for records related to Risen's book, Sterling deleted an email containing classified information, the government alleged.\n\nSterling now likely faces a lengthy stay in a federal prison.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, was convicted of espionage Monday on charges that he told a reporter for The New York Times about a secret operation to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe conviction is a significant victory for the Obama administration, which has conducted an unprecedented crackdown on officials who speak to journalists about security matters without the administration's approval. Prosecutors prevailed after a yearslong fight in which the reporter, James Risen, refused to identify his sources.\n\nThe case revolved around a C.I.A. operation in which a former Russian scientist provided Iran with intentionally flawed nuclear component schematics. Mr. Risen revealed the operation in his 2006 book, \"State of War,\" describing it as a mismanaged, potentially reckless mission that may have inadvertently aided the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nOn the third day of deliberations, the jury in federal court in Alexandria, Va., convicted Mr. Sterling on nine felony counts. Mr. Sterling, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1993 to 2002 and now lives in O'Fallon, Mo., faces a maximum possible sentence of decades in prison, though the actual sentence is likely to be far shorter. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema of Federal District Court, who presided over the weeklong trial, allowed Mr. Sterling to remain free on bond and set sentencing for April 24.\n\n\"This is a just and appropriate outcome,\" Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said. \"The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it. As this verdict proves, it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs.\"\n\nEdward B. MacMahon Jr., Mr. Sterling's lawyer, said he would seek to get the verdict thrown out and, failing that, file an appeal.\n\n\"We're obviously very saddened by the jury's verdict,\" Mr. MacMahon said in a telephone interview. \"We continue to believe in Jeffrey's innocence, and we're going to continue to fight for him up to the highest levels.\"\n\nBruce D. Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, an advocacy organization for journalists, said the Sterling conviction showed that forcing reporters to identify their confidential sources was unnecessary and ill advised.\n\n\"The speed with which the jury reached its verdict shows that reporter's testimony was not needed for the government to make its case,\" Mr. Brown said. \"I think going forward this is going to be a powerful precedent.\"\n\nLiberal advocacy groups have hailed Mr. Sterling as a whistle-blower for taking his concerns about the program to the Senate Intelligence Committee in early 2003, a time when dissenting voices in the C.I.A. were hushed as the country prepared for war in Iraq. The Justice Department and C.I.A., however, deny that characterization. They said that the Iran operation had not been mismanaged and that Mr. Sterling had gone to Congress and then the news media as a way to settle personal grievances.\n\nThe Justice Department had no direct proof that Mr. Sterling, who managed the Iranian operation, provided the information to Mr. Risen, but prosecutors stitched together a strong circumstantial case. They described Mr. Sterling, who is black, as bitter and frustrated about what he believed was workplace discrimination. Telephone records and emails showed that Mr. Sterling and Mr. Risen had talked frequently, and prosecutors argued that only Mr. Sterling had the information, the motive and the opportunity to leak it.\n\n\"The defendant put his own selfishness and his own vindictiveness ahead of the American people,\" Eric G. Olshan, a federal prosecutor, said during closing arguments Thursday. \"For what? He hated the C.I.A., and he wanted to settle the score.\"\n\nThe trial was part Washington spectacle, part cloak and dagger. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified, as did C.I.A. operatives who gave only their first names and last initials, with their faces shielded behind seven-foot-high partitions. A scientist was referred to only by his code name, Merlin. His wife was Mrs. Merlin.\n\nOfficials revealed their preferred strategies for persuading reporters not to run sensitive stories. Jurors learned that, at the C.I.A.'s office in New York, employees could easily walk out with classified documents and never be searched.\n\nMr. Sterling's lawyers said the government's case was based entirely on suspicion. \"The government has great lawyers,\" said Barry J. Pollack, a defense lawyer. \"It has a great theory. It just made a great argument. What the government lacks is evidence.\"\n\nMr. Sterling's lawyers argued that it was just as likely that Mr. Risen had learned about the operation from Capitol Hill staff members, then pieced together details from other sources at the C.I.A. and from the Russian scientist himself. Mr. Pollack acknowledged that Mr. Sterling had a relationship with Mr. Risen, but said they had talked only about Mr. Sterling's discrimination lawsuit against the C.I.A. Mr. Risen probably asked about Merlin and the Iranian operation, Mr. Pollack said, but Mr. Sterling did not provide any information.\n\nMr. Sterling is the latest in a string of former officials and contractors the Obama administration has charged with discussing national security matters with reporters. Under all previous presidents combined, three people had faced such prosecutions. Under President Obama, there have been eight cases, and journalists have complained that the crackdown has discouraged officials from discussing even unclassified security matters.\n\nMost of those charged since 2009 have pleaded guilty and avoided a trial. Of those, John Kiriakou, a former C.I.A. officer, is in federal prison, as are two former government contractors, Donald Sachtleben and Stephen Kim. Thomas A. Drake, a former National Security Agency official, cut a deal on a minor charge and avoided serving time.\n\nThe only other trial was the military court-martial of Chelsea Manning, the Army private formerly known as Bradley Manning, who was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for providing a trove of government documents to WikiLeaks, the antisecrecy organization.\n\nThe most prominent leak case, however, remains open. Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who downloaded and provided journalists with thousands of that agency's documents, has fled to Russia to avoid criminal charges. Those documents revealed a domestic surveillance program in which the N.S.A. monitored the phone records of every American.\n\nWhile the administration has defended the crackdown, Mr. Holder said he believed it went too far at times when it targeted journalists. Under Mr. Holder, prosecutors seized phone records from The Associated Press, labeled one Fox News reporter a potential criminal co-conspirator for inquiring about classified information and tried to force another to testify before a grand jury.\n\nMr. Risen's lengthy fight to avoid testifying about his sources turned the case into a rallying point for news organizations, who said the Justice Department had made it harder to cover national security beyond what it released in news statements and approved leaks, such as those that told a glowing story about the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Less favorable stories, such as those revealing warrantless wiretapping or secret prisons, led to criminal investigations.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear Mr. Risen's case, meaning he would have been forced to testify, and if he refused, he could have been put in jail. But Mr. Holder, in a reversal, said prosecutors would not force him to reveal his sources. With that option off the table, prosecutors opted not to call Mr. Risen to testify during the trial.",

He'll be sentenced in April.\n\nAs NPR's Carrie Johnson has noted, \"President Obama has pursued more of these criminal leak indictments than any of his predecessors.\"\n\nUpdate at 5:35 p.m. ET: 'Sad Day,' Attorney Says\n\nSterling's lawyer, Barry Pollack, says, \"It is a sad day for Mr. Sterling and his wife. We will be filing motions to set aside the verdict and file an appeal.\"\n\nOur original post continues:\n\nSterling's case has drawn wide attention -- and been drawn out by legal arguments -- in part because he was accused of giving secret information to James Risen of The New York Times, who later included details about the CIA's Iran operation in a book. In the fight to compel him to identify his source, Risen resisted efforts that included a federal subpoena.\n\nMonday, The New York Times reports:\n\n\"The case revolved around a C.I.A. operation in which a former Russian scientist provided Iran with intentionally flawed nuclear component schematics.

Last month, Attorney General Eric Holder confirmed that Risen would not be compelled to name his source.\n\nInstead, the government turned to other evidence to tie Risen to Sterling.\n\nCourt documents show that prosecutors have cited a March 2002 article by Risen about the former case officer and his claims the CIA practiced racial bias.

                    "body": "Jeffery Sterling, the former CIA agent who tried to blow the whistle on an \"ill-conceived, poorly executed and reckless\" agency effort to provide flawed nuclear plans to Iran, was found guilty of espionage by a federal jury on Monday in a case that Sterling's advocates say is just the latest example of the Obama adminstration's unprecedented attack on unauthorized leaks and whistleblowers.\n\n\"The Sterling case - especially in light of Obama's complicity in the cover-up of torture during the Bush administration - sends a clear message to people in government service: You won't get in trouble as long as you do what you're told (even torture people). But if you talk to a reporter and tell him something we want kept secret, we will spare no effort to destroy you.\" -- Dan Froomkin, The InterceptSterling, found guilty on nine separate counts, was accused by the Department of Justice of leaking details of the CIA plan -- known as Operation Merlin -- to New York Times reporter James Risen and much of the initial intrigue surrounding the case centered on Risen's refusal to acknowledge whether or not the CIA agent was, in fact, his source for the reporting that appeared in his 2006 book, State of War. In the end, Risen maintained his refusal to testify for or against Sterling and the Justice Department dropped their efforts to force his testimony.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, \"The Justice Department had no direct proof that Mr. Sterling, who managed the Iranian operation, provided the information to Mr. Risen, but prosecutors stitched together a strong circumstantial case.\"\n\nThe Washington Post characterized the guilty verdicts \"as a significant win for federal prosecutors and a presidential administration that has worked zealously to root out leakers.\"\n\nWhile U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called Sterling's conviction the \"just and appropriate outcome,\" critics of the government's case pilloried the entire ordeal. Sterling was allowed to return home until sentencing in the case is rendered on April 24.\n\nSterling's attorney, Edward B. MacMahon Jr., said he would seek to get the verdict thrown out and, failing that, file an appeal.\n\n\"We're obviously very saddened by the jury's verdict,\" MacMahon told the Times in in a telephone interview. \"We continue to believe in Jeffrey's innocence, and we're going to continue to fight for him up to the highest levels.\"\n\nAccording to the Times:\n\nLiberal advocacy groups have hailed Mr. Sterling as a whistle-blower for taking his concerns about the program to the Senate Intelligence Committee in early 2003, a time when dissenting voices in the C.I.A. were hushed as the country prepared for war in Iraq. The Justice Department and C.I.A., however, deny that characterization. They said that the Iran operation had not been mismanaged and that Mr. Sterling had gone to Congress and then the news media as a way to settle personal grievances.\n\nAsked for her reaction to the Sterling's conviction by FireDogLake's Kevin Gosztola, Jesselyn Radack, a Justice Department whistleblower, attorney and director of the Government Accountability Project's National Security and Human Rights Division, said the prosecution and conviction of Sterling represents \"a new low in the war in whistleblowers and government hypocrisy.\"\n\nSterling, Radack continued, \"was convicted in a purely circumstantial case of 'leaking.' It shows how far an embarrassed government will go to punish those who dare to commit the truth.\"\n\nAccording to journalist Marcy Wheeler, who has covered the case extensively for ExposeFacts.org and sat through nearly the entire trial, the government's case was striking for being strong on rhetoric but slim on actual facts. On Monday, after closing arguments had been made, Wheeler wrote:\n\n[Few] who haven't sat through the trial realize just how circumstantial the evidence on most of the charges against Sterling is.\n\nThe only evidence of phone calls between Sterling and James Risen immediately before Risen went to the CIA with a fully drafted story on the Merlin operation consists of 2 minutes and 40 seconds of calls, total, across 7 phone calls. Then there's one email in which Sterling sent Risen a link to an unclassified article on Iran posted by CNN.\n\nTwo minutes and 40 seconds for what would likely have been a 1000-word story?\n\nIndeed, in discussions immediately after the closing arguments, even Judge Brinkema acknowledged how circumstantial the case is. Ed MacMahon tried to get all the charges thrown out on venue grounds -- because, after all, the prosecution only presented evidence that Sterling and Risen had spoken, on any topic, for 2 minutes and 40 seconds in the state of Virginia.\n\nThat's it.\n\nNorman Solomon, Wheeler's colleague at ExposeFacts.org and who has also covered the trial closely, explained to Common Dreams in an email how one of the most striking things about the media coverage of the Sterling case was just how little of it there was.\n\n\"One of the most powerful forms of propaganda from corporate media is silence, and that has been a major dynamic in the sparse coverage of Jeffrey Sterling,\" Solomon said. \"Few media outlets have gone beyond handouts and rhetoric from the government.\"\n\nIn his latest dispatch about the trial, published Tuesday, Solomon referred to Sterling as an \"Invisible Man\" -- invoking the famous book by Ralph Ellison -- as he lamented the scant attention his case has received. \"While press-freedom groups and some others gradually rallied around Risen's right to source confidentiality,\" Solomon wrote, \"Sterling remained the Invisible Man.\"\n\nThough many mainstream outlets have now covered the verdict of trial, Solomon observed that very few have shown deep understanding of the case. \"Under such conditions,\" he continued, \"progressive outlets should go out of their way to inform people long before a trial starts. Otherwise, as happened on Monday, a verdict comes down and most people -- even those who want to support whistleblowers -- don't have the background understanding to put the verdict in context. We're playing catch-up when we should have been ahead of the prosecution curve.\"\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict on Monday, Gosztola offered this analysis:\n\nWhat will likely be most remembered about Sterling's case is how the government relentlessly pursued Risen for about seven years before buckling under pressure and deciding they would not force him to testify against his alleged source.\n\nCollateral damage was done to journalism in the process of the government's leak prosecution. The government collected records from Risen's personal and professional communications, which significantly impacted his ability to do his job as a reporter.\n\nThe prosecution of Sterling once more solidified the government's ability to wield the Espionage Act as a sledgehammer to come down hard on government employees, who dare to challenge the government's intelligence or \"national security\" programs by disclosing information to the press.\n\nPlacing the conviction of Sterling in the context of the Obama administration's refusal to hold anyone at the CIA or in the former Bush administration accountable for the agency's torture program, The Intercept's Dan Froomkin argues the case speaks volumes about the duplicity of the White House and the Justice Department when it comes to prosecuting alleged misconduct by government officials.\n\n\"The Sterling case - especially in light of Obama's complicity in the cover-up of torture during the Bush administration,\" writes Froomkin, \"sends a clear message to people in government service: You won't get in trouble as long as you do what you're told (even torture people). But if you talk to a reporter and tell him something we want kept secret, we will spare no effort to destroy you.\"",

                    "body": "Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was convicted on nine counts alleging violation of the Espionage Act; Sterling blew a highly classified Bush-era operation intended to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. He did so to no discernible public good; the crimes of which he now stands convicted are truly heinous.\n\nHere is how reporter Matt Apuzzo describes Sterling's conviction in the lead paragraph of his page-one New York Times story: \"Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, was convicted of espionage Monday on charges that he told a reporter for The New York Times about a secret operation to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.\" The New York Times reporter is James Risen; Sterling's conviction is based on his disclosures to Risen.\n\nUnlike other highly classified national security programs that Risen has blown, however, Risen was unable to enlist the assistance of the Times in publishing the details of this particular program. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appeared to testify at trial; she had succeeded in persuading Times editors that publication of Risen's story would do great harm to the national security of the United States.\n\nThe Times passed on the story. Risen accordingly saved it for his book State of War, whose publisher lacked the Times's compunctions in this case. Apuzzo's story on Sterling's conviction omits this illuminating context.\n\nJames Risen was the key to Sterling's guilty acts. Sterling was induced to disclose the classified information regarding the operation against Iran's nuclear program with Risen's promise of confidentiality as to the source.\n\nThe obligation to provide testimony to matters within his personal knowledge in criminal cases applies to James Risen as it does to other citizens. Eric Holder's Department of Justice nevertheless abandoned its efforts to secure Risen's testimony against Sterling.\n\nWithout Risen's testimony, the government's case against Sterling was circumstantial in crucial parts. Not surprisingly, before the jury returned with the convictions against Sterling yesterday, by the way, it had reported to the judge that it was deadlocked on several counts.\n\nWhile Risen is subject to the same testimonial obligations as other citizens, he is also subject to the same criminal liability under the Espionage Act as Jeffrey Sterling and others. Neither he nor his colleagues at the Times are cloaked in immunity for violation of the espionage laws of the United States.\n\nRisen has been charged with no offense; he has even skated on his noncompliance with the subpoena for his testimony in Sterling's case. Jeffrey Sterling is headed for prison; James Risen remains at large.\n\nNOTE: I wrote about the legal issues in the Times's publication of national security information protected under the Espionage Act in the Weekly Standard column \"Exposure,\" but Gabriel Schoenfeld owns this story. For a full understanding of what Risen has wrought here I urge interested readers to read Schoenfeld's Weekly Standard articles \"Not every leak is fit to print\" (2008), \"What gives?\" (2010), and \"A privileged press?\" (2014) as well as Schoenfeld's Power Line post \"A Risen in the sun.\"",

The episode made its way into a 2006 book written by Risen, leading to the CIA charging Sterling for violating the Espionage Act. The case, however, was backed up for years after the Department of Justice issued a subpoena to Risen demanding that he divulge his sources or face jail time, and Risen refused, claiming that their challenge was unconstitutional. (The DOJ backed down from that avenue in December.)\n\nThe DOJ's decision to prosecute Risen led to near-unanimous criticism of the Obama administration from the media, with Risen calling the President \"the greatest enemy to press freedom in a generation\" at one point.\n\nAccording to the AP, Sterling was furious that \"he had been mistreated and was angry that the agency refused to settle his racial discrimination complaint,\" leading to his decision to leak information about the mission to Risen. Sterling was also the handler of a Russian asset during the 2003 mission, in which they attempted to sabotage Iran's burgeoning nuclear program by giving them faulty blueprints to nuclear reactors, and, according to prosecutors, had \"misgivings\" about the direction of the operation.\n\nEarlier today, the Washington Post noted that the jury was still split, sending a note to U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema before noon saying they \"[could not] reach agreement on several counts\". Brinkema had instructed them to go back to deliberations, adding that she nor the lawyers could give them any more legal instruction: \"There's no more law that I can give you.\"",

He had vowed to go to jail rather than reveal his source and the government ultimately decided not to force him to testify.\n\nSterling allegedly shared information with Risen about a CIA plot to secretly give Iran false information meant to derail its nuclear programme. The government claimed the publication had endangered agents and ended the effort.\n\nThe information appeared in Risen's book State of War and prosecutors argued that only Sterling could have provided the information about the mission, which former national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testified was among the government's most closely held secrets during her tenure as well as one of its best chances to derail Iran's nuclear-weapons ambitions.\n\n\"This is a just and appropriate outcome,\" Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said. \"The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it. As this verdict proves, it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs.\"\n\nProsecutors had acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling but said the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming. Defense lawyers had said the evidence showed that Capitol Hill staffers who had been briefed on the classified operation were more likely the source of the leak.\n\nFollowing the verdict, defense lawyer Edward MacMahon said he is disappointed in the verdict but \"we still believe in Jeffrey's innocence\". He said the defense will pursue every available legal option to get the jury's verdict overturned.\n\nSterling will have the option to appeal his case after he is sentenced in April. Motions to dismiss the case on various legal grounds are also still pending.\n\nThe classified operation at the heart of the trial involved using a CIA asset nicknamed Merlin, who had been a Russian nuclear engineer, to foist deliberately flawed nuclear-weapons blueprints on the Iranians, hoping they would spend years trying to develop parts that had no hope of ever working.\n\nSource: Agencies\n\nShare this:Share on TumblrEmail Related\n\nFacebook comments:",

Prosecutors had said Sterling's actions had put lives at risk as well as compromising efforts to deter Iran's contested nuclear plans.\n\nEarlier in the day the jurors had informed the judge that they could not reach a unanimous verdict, but they were urged by the judge to keep talking and a few hours later they delivered guilty verdicts.\n\nThe central issue in the two-week trial was who had told James Risen, a reporter for the New York Times, about the top-secret mission.\n\nThe plan involved using a CIA asset, a former Russian nuclear engineer nicknamed Merlin, to supply the Iranians with deliberately flawed plans for nuclear weapons, in the hope that Iran would spend years attempting to develop parts which stood no chance of working. The mission was outlined in Risen's 2006 book \"State of War.\" Sterling had been Merlin's case handler.\n\nProsecutors had acknowledged a lack of direct evidence against Sterling, however said there was strong circumstantial evidence against him. They said Sterling believed he had been mistreated by his employer. Defense attorney Barry Pollack said it made more sense for a US congressional staffer at Capitol Hill to have leaked to Risen.\n\nThe court case against Sterling was delayed for several years because prosecutors were trying to make Risen divulge his sources, which he refused to do.\n\nIran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes but the US and its Western allies fear it to be a front for producing nuclear weapons and had targeted Iran with heavy economic sanctions. Following a breakthrough in negotiations in late 2013 which led to an interim deal for limited sanctions relief in exchange for Iran curbing some aspects of its program, negotiations have been underway to reach a long-term agreement by June 30 this year.",

Risen implied the plan could have backfired because the Iranians may have been able to glean some helpful information from the flawed prints.\n\nFor years, federal prosecutors had sought to compel Risen to divulge his sources. The Justice Department ultimately decided not to call Risen as a witness in Sterling's trial, after he vowed not to cooperate on the stand, even if threatened with contempt of court.\n\nProsecutors argued Sterling had been seeking revenge on the intelligence agency after his firing in the early 2000s.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was among those who testified in the case, detailing how she and President George W.

Relying on circumstantial evidence, prosecutors argued that the section of Risen's book detailing the Iran plot seemed to be based on the perspective of Sterling, who had worked as a CIA handler for a Russian nuclear engineer tasked with delivering the flawed blueprints.\n\nSterling's defense team argued the leak had stemmed from Capitol Hill staffers.",

(Credit: www.debvanpoolen.com/)\n\nThe mass media have suddenly discovered Jeffrey Sterling -- after his conviction Monday afternoon as a CIA whistleblower.\n\nSterling's indictment four years ago received fleeting news coverage that recited the government's charges. From the outset, the Justice Department portrayed him as bitter and vengeful -- with the classic trash-the-whistleblower word \"disgruntled\" thrown in -- all of which the mainline media dutifully recounted without any other perspective.\n\nYear after year, Sterling's case dragged through appellate courts, tangled up with the honorable refusal of journalist James Risen to in any way identify sources for his 2006 book State of War. While news stories or pundits occasionally turned their lens on Risen, they scarcely mentioned Sterling, whose life had been turned upside down -- fired by the CIA early in the Bush administration after filing a racial discrimination lawsuit, and much later by the 10-count indictment that included seven counts under the Espionage Act.\n\nSterling was one of the very few African American case officers in the CIA. He became a whistleblower by virtue of going through channels to the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2003 to inform staffers about the CIA's ill-conceived, poorly executed and dangerous Operation Merlin, which had given a flawed design for a nuclear weapons component to Iran back in 2000.\n\nLong story short, by the start of 2011, Sterling was up against the legal wall. While press-freedom groups and some others gradually rallied around Risen's right to source confidentiality, Sterling remained the Invisible Man.\n\nLike almost everyone, for a long time I knew close to nothing about Sterling or his legal battle. But as I began to realize how much was at stake in the government's ongoing threat to jail Risen for refusing to betray any source, Sterling started to come into my peripheral vision.\n\nLast spring, I worked with colleagues at RootsAction.org to launch a petition drive titled We Support James Risen Because We Support a Free Press. As petitions go, it was a big success, for reasons well beyond the fact that it gained more than 100,000 signers with plenty of help from other initiating groups (The Nation, FAIR, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, The Progressive and Center for Media and Democracy).\n\nThe Justice Department, which had been aggressively pursuing Risen for a half-dozen years at that point, was set back on its heels by the major favorable publicity that came out of our mid-August presentation of the Risen petition in tandem with a news conference at the National Press Club.\n\nQuick media ripple effects included a strong column by Maureen Dowd in support of fellow New York Times journalist Risen (though she didn't mention the petition or the news conference, which she attended). In the fall, I teamed up with a colleague at ExposeFacts.org, the incisive investigative journalist Marcy Wheeler, to write what turned out to be a cover story in The Nation, The Government War Against Reporter James Risen, providing the first in-depth account of the intertwined cases of Risen and Sterling.\n\nBut throughout the fall, for the mass media as well as all but a few progressive media outlets, Jeffrey Sterling remained the Invisible Man.\n\nThe principle of supporting whistleblowers as strongly as journalists is crucial. Yet support for the principle is hit-and-miss among individuals and organizations that should be clear and forthright. This need is especially great when the government is invoking \"national security\" claims.\n\nAs the whistleblower advocate Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project has said: \"When journalists become targets, they have a community and a lobby of powerful advocates to go to for support. Whistleblowers are in the wilderness. ... They're indicted under the most serious charge you can level against an American: being an enemy of the state.\"\n\nWe encountered this terrain when the same initiating groups launched a new petition -- this one in support of Jeffrey Sterling -- Blowing the Whistle on Government Recklessness Is a Public Service, Not a Crime.\n\nSome groups that had been wonderfully supportive of the Risen petition -- notably the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Committee to Protect Journalists -- opted not to have anything to do with the Sterling petition. In sharp contrast, quick endorsement of the Sterling petition came from Reporters Without Borders and the Government Accountability Project.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Jeffrey Sterling went to trial at last. He was at the defense table during seven days of proceedings that included very dubious testimony from 23 present and former CIA employees as well as the likes of Condoleezza Rice.\n\nWhen a court clerk read out the terrible verdict Monday afternoon, Sterling continued to stand with the dignity that he had maintained throughout the trial.\n\nAt age 47, Jeffrey Sterling is facing a very long prison sentence.

Sterling, 47, was fired from the agency in early 2000s. However, they failed to prove that the former CIA employee was the one, who leaked the information to the press.\n\nThe evidence against Sterling was largely circumstantial and he always denied the charges. Sterling's defense team said that several Capitol Hill staffers were familiar with the operation and could be the source of the leak, according to the AP.\n\nAttorney General Eric H. Holder called the verdict a \"just and appropriate outcome,\" as quoted by the Washington Post. Sterling's disclosures \"constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it\" and placed lives of Americans at risk, Holder added.\n\n\"This is a sad day for Mr. Sterling and his wife,\" said Sterling's defense attorney Barry Pollack, as quoted by the Washington Post. \"We will pursue all legal avenues with the trial court and on appeal to challenge Mr. Sterling's conviction,\" he added.\n\nThe New York Times described the conviction as a significant victory for the Obama administration that mounted what the newspaper called an \"unprecedented crackdown\" on government officials, who leak information to journalists.",

It shows how far an embarrassed government will go to punish those who dare to commit the truth.\"\n\nThere were very few communications between Risen and Sterling presented in court. No emails presented showed the two had ever had communications about classified information or \"Operation Merlin,\" the top secret CIA operation the government alleged he exposed.\n\nQuestions about whether the crimes alleged even occurred in Virginia were raised throughout the trial, since Sterling had been living in O'Fallon, Missouri.\n\nProsecutors presented documents from 1987 about calling into the CIA from rotary phones, which had been found in Sterling's home in Missouri, and claimed the retroactively classified documents had been moved from Virginia.\n\nThe government also called an FBI investigating officer's hairdresser to testify about how she had read Risen's book, State of War, containing the alleged leak from Sterling. Essentially, prosecutors wanted the jury to believe Sterling had conspired to have books with his leak sold in Virginia.\n\nJournalist Marcy Wheeler reported that the issue of venue was one the jury asked Judge Leonie Brinkema about. They wanted to know if obstruction of justice could have taken place in Missouri and if the document at issue in one of the counts could have been stored in his residence. The government had to prove for each offense that the offenses had been committed in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n\nAltogether, these are the offenses that Sterling was convicted of committing, according to Wheeler:\n\nSterling will remain free on bond until his sentencing, which is scheduled for April 24. His defense plans to \"seek to have the verdict thrown out\" and, if that does not happen, they will appeal.\n\nOperation Merlin involved a Russian asset providing flawed nuclear blueprints to Iran. It was an operation that Sterling himself is known to have blown the whistle on internally when he met with two Senate intelligence committee staffers in March 2003.\n\nThe defense's story during the trial was that the leak had probably come from someone on the Senate intelligence committee. The committee apparently refused to cooperate with an investigation into the leak.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the Justice Department has convicted four individuals of violating the Espionage Act by leaking to the press. Former FBI linguist Shamai Leibowitz, former State Department employee Stephen Kim and former FBI agent Donald Sachtleben pled guilty and were sentenced to prison. US military whistleblower Chelsea Manning was convicted after a military trial of several Espionage Act violations.\n\nIt has prosecuted more cases accusing government employees of Espionage Act violations than all previous presidents combined. Many of the individuals pursued were involved in acts of whistleblowing before they became targets of a criminal investigation.\n\nSterling, an African-American, brought a racial claim against the CIA before he was accused of leaking. He appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court in 2005, however, the government successfully had the case thrown out by invoking the \"state secrets\" privilege.\n\nHis own performance reviews were considered \"state secrets.\" Stunningly, Wheeler reported that in the trial the government was using these exact same performance reviews to convict Sterling and the jury was not permitted to know about this fact.\n\nThe government used Sterling's loss in his lawsuit against the CIA to argue that he disclosed \"Operation Merlin\" in revenge.\n\nWhat will likely be most remembered about Sterling's case is how the government relentlessly pursued Risen for about seven years before buckling under pressure and deciding they would not force him to testify against his alleged source.\n\nCollateral damage was done to journalism in the process of the government's leak prosecution. The government collected records from Risen's personal and professional communications, which significantly impacted his ability to do his job as a reporter.\n\nThe prosecution of Sterling once more solidified the government's ability to wield the Espionage Act as a sledgehammer to come down hard on government employees, who dare to challenge the government's intelligence or \"national security\" programs by disclosing information to the press.",

Comey, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department's Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente of the Eastern District of Virginia made the announcement.\n\n\"This is a just and appropriate outcome,\" said Attorney General Holder. \"The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it. As this verdict proves, it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs. And I want to thank the investigators, prosecutors and support staff who made this outcome possible for their relentless efforts in advancing a complex case that spanned multiple years.\"\n\n\"He violated his sworn duty to protect our nation's secrets and he betrayed our country,\" said Director Comey. \"The FBI will continue to pursue these cases vigorously.\"\n\n\"Jeffrey Sterling was trusted with the nation's most sensitive secrets and chose to expose them - putting our national security at risk, and endangering lives in the process,\" said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. \"These cases are challenging, but vitally important to our efforts to secure critical intelligence on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n\"Over 10 years ago a disgruntled former CIA employee disclosed extremely sensitive classified information to a journalist,\" said U.S. Attorney Boente. \"That classified information was critical to our national defense, and releasing it was illegal and went against Mr. Sterling's professional commitments to the CIA. Mr. Sterling's vindictive and careless choices ultimately led us here today and to this unanimous verdict. I would like to thank the trial team and our partners at the FBI's Washington Field Office and the Central Intelligence Agency for their hard work and commitment to this case.\"\n\nJeffrey Alexander Sterling, 47, of O'Fallon, Missouri, was convicted today in the Eastern District of Virginia of six counts of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information, and one count each of unlawful retention of national defense information, unauthorized conveyance of government property and obstruction of justice. Sterling was indicted on Dec. 22, 2010, and arrested on Jan. 6, 2011. Sentencing is scheduled for April 24, 2015.\n\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Sterling was employed by the CIA from May 1993 to January 2002. From November 1998 through May 2000, he was assigned to a classified clandestine operational program designed to undermine the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He was also the operations officer assigned to handle a human asset associated with that program, a person identified at trial as Merlin. Sterling was reassigned in May 2000, at which time he was no longer authorized to receive or possess classified documents concerning the program or the individual.\n\nIn connection with his employment, Sterling, who is a lawyer, signed various security, secrecy and non-disclosure agreements in which he agreed never to disclose classified information to unauthorized persons, acknowledged that classified information was the property of the CIA and also acknowledged that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information could constitute a criminal offense. These agreements also set forth the proper procedures to follow if Sterling had concerns that the CIA had engaged in any \"unlawful or improper\" conduct that implicated classified information. These procedures permit such concerns to be addressed while still protecting the classified nature of the information. The media was not an authorized party to receive such classified information.\n\nIn August 2000, Sterling pursued administrative and civil actions against the CIA. Evidence at trial showed that Sterling, in retaliation for the CIA's refusal to settle those actions on terms favorable to him, disclosed information concerning the classified operational program and the human asset to a New York Times reporter working on an unpublished article in early 2003 and a book the reporter published in January 2006. Sterling's civil and administrative claims were ultimately dismissed by the court.\n\nEvidence demonstrated that in February and March 2003, Sterling made various telephone calls to the reporter's residence and e-mailed a newspaper article about the weapons capabilities of a certain country that was within Sterling's previous clandestine operational assignment. While the possible newspaper article containing the classified information Sterling provided was ultimately not published in 2003, evidence showed that Sterling and the reporter remained in touch from December 2003 through November 2005 via telephone and e-mail. In January 2006, the reporter published a book that contained classified information about the program and the human asset.\n\nEvidence at trial showed that Sterling was aware of a grand jury investigation into the matter by June 2006, when he was served a grand jury subpoena for documents relating to the reporter's book. Nevertheless, between April and July 2006, Sterling deleted the e-mail containing the classified information he had sent from his account in an effort to obstruct the investigation.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI's Washington, D.C., Field Office, with assistance in the arrest from the FBI's St. Louis Field Office. This case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Eric G. Olshan of the Criminal Division's Public Integrity Section and Senior Litigation Counsel James L. Trump and Assistant U.S. Attorney Dennis Fitzpatrick of the Eastern District of Virginia.",

                    "body": "Jeffrey Sterling, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, was convicted of espionage today. He was charged with telling a journalist about a secret operation to disrupt Iran's nuclear program. The journalist was James Risen of the New York Times.\n\nScott has written extensively about this case, focusing on Risen's disclosure of Sterling's secrets and the government's unwillingness to require the journalist to testify in the case. Fortunately, Sterling was convicted without Risen's testimony. But since this outcome wasn't assured, the government should have forced Risen to testify or go to jail. For that matter, Risen should have been prosecuted. He was, after all, Sterling's accomplice.\n\nEric Holder had this to say following the verdict:\n\nThis is a just and appropriate outcome. The defendant's unauthorized disclosures of classified information compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security. The disclosures placed lives at risk. And they constituted an egregious breach of the public trust by someone who had sworn to uphold it.\n\nAs this verdict proves, it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs.\n\nBut Sterling's disclosures would not have \"compromised operations undertaken in defense of America's national security\" and would not have \"placed lives at risk\" if Risen hadn't published them. Even the New York Times, Risen's employer, declined to run Risen's story; he used Sterling's material in a book.\n\nUnlike Sterling, Risen took no oath to uphold the public trust. But one can violate the law without having taken such an oath. As Scott says: \"if Sterling violated the Espionage Act, it is even clearer that Risen did so too. He is subject to the same criminal liability as Sterling and other citizens for violation of the Espionage Act.\"\n\nHolder is correct that it is possible successfully to prosecute unauthorized disclosures that harm our national security without getting journalists to divulge their sources. But it's also possible for such a prosecution to fail for want of the journalists' testimony. That it didn't happen in Sterling's case doesn't mean it can't happen.\n\nNor was it a foregone conclusion that it wouldn't happen in the Sterling case. If the offense is as serious as Holder says -- and it is -- why not use every avenue possible to force the accomplice to testify?\n\nBut a more basic question is, why shouldn't the government \"interfere with journalists' ability to do their jobs\" when, as here, doing the job means \"inflict[ing] harm upon national security\"? Stated differently, is it the legitimate job of journalists to harm U.S. national security in the manner that Risen did?\n\nThe New York Times didn't view its journalistic mission as requiring it to jeopardize national security by running Risen's story. Eric Holder seems to believe otherwise. Why?",

                    "body": "The AG wins a conviction against a former spy without forcing a journalist to reveal his source.\n\nA federal jury's decision Monday to convict a former CIA officer for leaking top-secret information to a New York Times reporter was a big win for prosecutors -- and for Attorney General Eric Holder's new approach to handling sensitive cases involving journalists.\n\nHolder decided to spare the reporter in the case, New York Times correspondent James Risen, from testifying against his sources. The move could become an important part of the soon-to-depart attorney general's legacy and a guidepost for future government leak cases given that the government won the case without much testimony from the reporter who received the information.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHolder and his allies are arguing that they have helped secure journalists' First Amendment rights with the maneuver, but whistleblower advocates worry that the prison time ex-CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling is facing in the wake of the trial will wind up silencing federal employees seeking to expose government malfeasance or ineptitude.\n\nHolder perplexed and irritated many Justice Department lawyers with his decision last month effectively taking Risen's testimony off the table after a seven-year court fight in which the government defeated Risen's claims that reporter's privilege protected him from testifying against Sterling.\n\nThe attorney general's action was consistent with a series of moves over the past year and a half in which he sought to demonstrate greater sensitivity to the concerns of journalists. The recalibration was prodded not by Risen's predicament or a sudden bout of introspection, but by a political firestorm that broke out in 2013 over prosecutors' aggressive investigations of leaks to the Associated Press and Fox News.\n\nSoon after the jury returned its string of nine guilty verdicts in the CIA leak case Monday, Holder claimed the result vindicated his effort to pursue such prosecutions without trying to force testimony from unwilling reporters.\n\n\"As this verdict proves, it is possible to fully prosecute unauthorized disclosures that inflict harm upon our national security without interfering with journalists' ability to do their jobs,\" the attorney general said in a statement.\n\nHowever, other lawyers said it was unclear whether the government's success against Sterling without much help from Risen signaled that approach could be duplicated or whether it was unique to the situation at hand.\n\n\"They had a pretty decent circumstantial case\" said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches law at George Washington University. \"It was a high degree of difficulty, but they had a lot of evidence pieced together, which turned out to be enough.\"\n\n\"It would be hard to generalize from this and say in future leak cases we don't need to even try to speak to a reporter,\" he added.\n\nEliason also pointed out that Risen was highly unlikely to ever name his source, so the effort to force him to testify amounted to a kind of sideshow that ultimately was going to leave the prosecution case right where it ended up.\n\n\"In part, it was surrendering to reality,\" the ex-prosecutor said of Holder's decision to exempt Risen from the potential of contempt for refusing to reveal his sources. \"You were not really gaining anything by taking all that fallout over putting a reporter in jail.\"\n\nFormer Holder spokesman Matthew Miller agreed, arguing that the downside to Holder's decision was minimal.\n\n\"Prosecutors by their nature never want to have a tool taken away from them, but the fact is leak cases almost never involve a journalist's testimony anyway,\" Miller said. \"The department has lost a tool that, even in the rare circumstances where it was used, was largely ineffective because most reporters just won't testify.\"\n\nStill, regardless of whether Risen's testimony would ever have been forthcoming, it's clear that without decisions by top officials like Holder and his former deputy James Cole, prosecutors would have continued their battle to press the reporter for at least some incriminating testimony against Sterling.\n\nSuch efforts did prove effective in one high-profile case: the prosecution of Vice President Dick Cheney's aide Scooter Libby on charges of obstructing a leak probe. New York Times reporter Judith Miller spent 85 days in jail for contempt before she agreed to testify to a grand jury after Libby called her to release her from her promise of confidentiality.\n\nAs Holder prepares to leave office when his successor is confirmed -- perhaps as soon as next month if the Senate approves Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch -- his handling of the Sterling case seems likely to be one of the final chapters in his legacy on the Justice Department's relationship with the press.\n\n\"To the extent that [Holder's] decision in this case makes future federal prosecutors think twice before seeking to compel a reporter's testimony as a first resort, that's a very good thing and an important part of his legacy,\" a source close to Holder said, asking not to be named. \"It will institutionalize a process where some pause is taken by prosecutors and potentially future attorneys general.\"\n\nMiller said Holder has been committed for some time to fixing his and the department's relationship with the media and First Amendment advocates.\n\n\"I think he realized in the summer of 2013 that the balance between the press and the Department of Justice had gotten too far out of whack and the department was being too aggressive,\" the former aide said. \"He saw his job in his remaining time in office to get the process back in balance and leave a better process.\"\n\nThe furor over the AP and Fox News probes that tumbled into public view at that time became so intense that President Barack Obama was pulled into the controversy.\n\n\"Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,\" Obama said in May 2013.\n\nHolder's decision to drop demands for Risen's testimony about his sources could help dampen concern about the treatment of journalists, but it won't extinguish complaints that the unprecedented flurry of nine leak-related prosecutions during the Obama administration has chilled whistleblowers from taking their concerns to the media. In fact, Sterling's conviction on every count sent to the jury -- and the prospect of a lengthy prison term for the ex-CIA officer -- might embolden prosecutors intent on stamping out leaks.\n\n\"There are all these cases that are legally plausible that they could win in court. The question is whether they should be bringing them, as a matter of policy or morality,\" said Columbia Law School professor David Pozen. \"That a case that is brought to trial ended up going well for the prosecution when the laws are written so broadly doesn't really surprise me.\"\n\nOne factor that could affect the impact of the Sterling case on future whistleblowers is whether other potential leakers think he had a legitimate reason to expose the CIA program at the heart of the case. The jury's verdict doesn't clearly resolve that question, which the trial also left muddled.\n\nProsecutors said Sterling was a disgruntled ex-employee who concocted flaws in the CIA's top-secret effort to target Iran's nuclear program after his discrimination lawsuit against the agency foundered. The defense never conceded that the former spy leaked anything.\n\nInstead, Sterling's lawyers argued that he raised legitimate concerns through legal channels with the Senate intelligence committee about an operation which seemed ham-handed and potentially dangerous. CIA witnesses called the operation a success but never produced any proof it deterred Iran's nuclear program.\n\nDespite the government's triumph in the Sterling case, Pozen said he's not sure it will produce an uptick in leak prosecutions. He said the Obama administration seemed to have passed a \"tipping point,\" where the surge in leak cases has abated after figures like Obama and Holder began speaking out about the consequences of pressing too hard in such probes.\n\nOne key test the Justice Department is facing is whether to file charges against former CIA Director and retired Army Gen. David Petraeus for allegedly sharing classified information with his mistress. That decision, expected to be made after Holder leaves office, will highlight the fact that top officials almost never face leak-related charges.\n\n\"Sterling was a fairly low-level player who was not part of the game of leaks that the higher levels of officialdom play,\" Pozen said. \"It's clear Petraeus is going to be a much harder decision.\"",

He's charged with illegally disclosing classified information to journalist James Risen, who wrote about the secret operation in a 2006 book.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJudge Leonie Brinkema gave jurors an early lunch break but urged them to continue deliberations in the afternoon. Outside jurors' presence, she told lawyers that she is inclined to accept a partial verdict if the jury again sends back a note claiming an impasse. She said she is not inclined to force them to deliberate beyond Monday.\n\nThe jury's note implies that it has reached a verdict on some counts, but it is unclear whether those are convictions or acquitals. Sterling faces nine counts in all -- six of which charge him with the disclosure or attempted disclosure of national defense information. One count alleges unlawful retention of national defense information. Another count charges him with illegally conveying government property and a final count alleges obstruction of justice.\n\nProsecutors say Sterling wanted to expose an operation to funnel deliberately flawed nuclear blueprints to the Iranians to get back at the agency for perceived mistreatment.\n\nDefense lawyers say Senate staffers who had been briefed on the project were more likely the source of the leak.",

                    "body": "Courtroom sketch by Debra Van Poolen. (Credit: debvanpoolen.com/)\n\nContinuing to deliberate as this week gets underway, the jurors in the CIA leak trial might ponder a notable claim from the government: \"This case is not about politics.\"\n\nThe prosecution made that claim a few days ago in closing arguments -- begun with a somber quotation from Condoleezza Rice about the crucial need to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Of course prosecutor Eric Olshan was not foolish enough to quote Rice's most famous line: \"We don't want the smoking gun to become a mushroom cloud.\"\n\nDuring the seven days of the trial, which received scant media coverage, Rice attracted the most attention. But little of her testimony actually got out of the courtroom, and little of what did get out illuminated the political context of the government's case against former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling.\n\nA heavy shroud over this trial -- almost hidden by news media in plain sight -- has been context: the CIA's collusion with the Bush White House a dozen years ago, using WMD fear and fabrication to stampede the United States into making war on Iraq.\n\nAnd part of the ongoing context of the Sterling case has been the Obama administration's unrelenting pursuit of Sterling for allegedly leaking classified information -- revealed in the last chapter of a book by James Risen -- about a now-15-year-old CIA operation that's far more suitable for Freedom of Information Act disclosures than criminal prosecution. The jury is weighing nine felony counts, including seven under the atrociously misapplied Espionage Act.\n\nIt was just six weeks after the invasion of Iraq when, at the end of April 2003, Rice hosted a meeting at the White House to tell representatives of the New York Times that the newspaper should not report on Operation Merlin, the CIA's ill-conceived and dangerous maneuver that had provided a flawed design for a nuclear weapon component to Iran three years earlier.\n\nThe Times management caved within a week. Only Risen's book State of War, published in January 2006, finally brought Operation Merlin to light.\n\nRice was in her usual smooth form at the Sterling trial. Emphatic that the CIA's Operation Merlin was hardly known to anyone, Rice testified: \"This program was very closely held. It was one of the most closely held programs during my tenure.\" Yet the CIA manager in charge of Operation Merlin (\"Bob S,\" who appeared at the trial behind a screen) testified that the operation was known to more than 90 people.\n\nHelping to lay groundwork for the Iraq invasion, Rice was a key enabler for the CIA's slam-dunk mendacity about Saddam Hussein's purported weapons of mass destruction. More than a decade later, she has used the Sterling trial as an opportunity for more distortion of the historical record, as though her quash-the-Merlin-story meeting at the White House in 2003 was free of self-service.\n\nThe prosecution helped Rice settle into her stance:\n\nQ: \"Now, was the purpose of your convening this meeting out of any sort of embarrassment that it would get out that there had been a botched operation?\"\n\nRICE: \"My concern in convening this meeting was that we had a very sensitive, extremely important program for the security of the country that was about to be compromised . . . That was my concern.\"\n\nBut one of the prosecution's main concerns, no doubt shared by Rice, had to do with insulating the trial from intrusive context -- a context that could explain why any whistleblower or journalist might want to expose and debunk Operation Merlin -- an operation targeting a supposed nuclear weapons program in Iran, a country that the Bush administration was eager to attack with the goal of regime change.\n\nWhen the time came for Rice to face cross-examination, defense lawyer Barry Pollack tried to blow away some fog:\n\nQ: \"[P]reventing working nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of rogue states is one of the most important missions of your, the administration you worked for certainly -\"\n\nRICE: \"Yes.\"\n\nQ: \"- and any other administration, correct?\"\n\nRICE: \"That's correct.\"\n\nQ: \"And certainly counterproliferation was of great interest at this particular time, correct?\"\n\nRICE: \"That's correct.\"\n\nQ: \"The United States had invaded Iraq the earlier month?\"\n\nPROSECUTOR OLSHAN: \"Objection.\"\n\nJUDGE LEONIE BRINKEMA: \"Well, we've heard that before. Let's just move this along, Mr. Pollack. Sustained.\"\n\nA week later, in the closing arguments, Pollack -- who noted that \"the government has great lawyers\" -- told the jury: \"Make no mistake. This is a very important case for the government.\" He pointedly reminded jurors that the last chapter in Risen's book \"made the CIA look bad.\"\n\nMinutes later, wrapping up the prosecution's closing statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Trump declared: \"This case is not about politics. It's not about salvaging the reputation of the CIA.\"\n\nBut, no matter how great the government's lawyers may be, the case of United States of America v. Jeffrey Alexander Sterling has everything to do with politics and the CIA's reputation.",

The earlier post appears below.\n\nA federal court jury mulling an array of leak-related charges against former CIA Officer Jeffrey Sterling signaled Monday that it is having difficulty agreeing on some of the nine felony counts in the case.\n\nThe jury began deliberating in Alexandria, Virginia, on Thursday after hearing testimony over seven days about claims Sterling leaked details of a top-secret CIA operation aimed at undermining Iran's nuclear program by giving Tehran flawed atomic weapons designs. The project was detailed in a 2006 book by New York Times reporter James Risen, who did not testify at the trial.\n\nJurors asked technical questions about some of the charges last week, but a note to emerge just before noon Monday was the first explicit sign the 12-member panel might be stuck.\n\n\"We cannot reach agreement on several counts. We need additional instructions on how to proceed,\" the jury said in a note U.S. District Court Judge Leonie Brinkema read in court. The note did not appear to disclose which counts were in dispute or whether the verdicts on the other counts were for acquittal, conviction or some combination of the two.\n\nDue to that uncertainty, it's not clear whether the jury's predicament favored the defense or the prosecution. Any sign of difficulty convicting on some charges is a blow to the prosecution, which has spent more than a decade pursuing the case and contended Sterling was the only person who could logically have been Risen's main source.\n\nHowever, conviction on even a single count could send Sterling to prison for years.\n\nWith the jury being held outside the courtroom, Brinkema said she planned to give the jurors a mild admonition to keep trying, but she wasn't inclined to force them to stay at it if they were deadlocked.\n\n\"It's a very complicated case ... a circumstantial evidence case. This jury's been out since Thursday,\" the judge said.\n\nThe defense and prosecution appeared to agree it was too soon to take a partial verdict, although two of the key prosecutors on the case only made it to the hastily called hearing after it was already underway.\n\nProsecutor Dennis Fitzpatrick told Brinkema it was \"probably premature\" to see what verdicts jurors had settled on.\n\nDefense lawyer Edward MacMahon Jr. also said he'd put off such a move.\n\nAfter calling jurors back into the courtroom, Brinkema urged them to go to lunch and \"relax a little bit.\"\n\n\"You need to listen very carefully to each other,\" she said, urging them to reach agreement \"if you can do so without violence to your own individual judgment.\"\n\nThe judge told jurors in the minority to listen to those in the majority and vice versa, but she also said that was about all she could offer in the way of guidance.\n\n\"There's no more law I can give you,\" she said, before sending the jury off for its hourlong lunch break.\n\nFollow @politico",

Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, who has been held by the extremist Islamic State group after crashing in December. It wasn't clear when the pilot's possible release had entered the picture.\n\nThe issue of a prisoner swap is sensitive, given Jordanian concern over the pilot, and Nakayama emerged from the Japanese Embassy today with no new updates.\n\nGunmen at luxury Tripoli hotel take hostages\n\nTRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -- Gunmen stormed a luxury Libyan hotel popular with foreigners today, killing at least three guards and taking hostages, a security official said.\n\nEssam Al-Naas, a spokesman for a Tripoli security agency, said a standoff continued Tuesday afternoon at the Corinthia Hotel, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nA hotel staffer said five masked attackers wearing bulletproof vests stormed the hotel after security at the gates tried to stop them. He said they entered the hotel and fired randomly at the staff in the lobby.\n\nThe staffer said the gunmen fired in his direction when he opened his door to look out. He said he joined the rest of the staff and foreign guests fleeing out the hotel's back doors into the parking lot.\n\nWhen they got there, he said a car bomb exploded in the parking lot, only a hundred meters (yards) away. He said this came after a protection force entered the lobby and opened fire on the attackers. He said two guards were immediately killed. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared retribution.\n\nObama touts gender and religious equality in India\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- President Barack Obama gently nudged India today to fulfill its constitution's pledge to uphold the \"dignity of the individual,\" drawing on his own experience as a minority in the United States as he closed out a three-day visit to New Delhi.\n\nObama said that while he has had extraordinary opportunities, \"there were moments in my life where I've been treated differently because of the color of my skin.\" As he touted the importance of religious tolerance, he noted the persistent false rumors that he is a Muslim, not a Christian.\n\n\"There have been times where my faith has at times been questioned by people who don't know me, or they've said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing,\" Obama said.\n\nEquality is enshrined in India's constitution, but religious minorities and women have experienced harassment and violence. A horrific gang rape on a moving bus in the heart of New Delhi in 2012 sparked public protests, which prompted more stringent laws. But critics say more progress is needed and Obama gave voice to their cause.\n\n\"Every woman should be able to go about her day -- to walk the street or ride the bus -- and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves,\" Obama said to applause from the audience of 1,500 at the Siri Fort Auditorium, a government-run event center.\n\nFacebook, Instagram suffer hour-long outage\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Facebook said it suffered a self-inflicted outage lasting an hour today that made its site inaccessible to users worldwide.\n\nThe glitch reported in Asia, the United States, Australia and the U.K. affected access from PCs and Facebook's mobile app. The social media giant's Instagram service was also inaccessible.\n\nA Facebook statement said the disruption was caused by a technical change it made to the site and wasn't a cyberattack.\n\nLizard Squad, a group notorious for attention seeking antics online, claimed responsibility on Twitter for the outages.\n\nEx-CIA officer convicted of leaking secrets\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- For years, ex-CIA case officer Jeffrey Sterling was the one under indictment but prosecutors' primary focus of pursuit was journalist Jeffrey Risen.\n\nProsecutors believed Sterling leaked details to Risen about one of the government's most closely held secrets: a secret CIA mission to derail Iran's nuclear ambitions by giving them deliberately flawed blueprints.\n\nRisen, though, wouldn't divulge his sources. Prosecutors sought court orders forcing Risen to testify, saying their job would be immeasurably more difficult without his testimony.\n\nUltimately, though, prosecutors won their case without Risen. On Monday, Sterling was convicted in federal court on all nine charges he faced after a two-week trial in which Risen never made an appearance.",

                    "body": "Monday's guilty verdict in the trial of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling on espionage charges -- for talking to a newspaper reporter -- is the latest milepost on the dark and dismal path Barack Obama has traveled since his inaugural promises to usher in a \"new era of openness.\"\n\nFar from rejecting the authoritarian bent of his presidential predecessor, Obama has simply adjusted it, adding his own personal touches, most notably an enthusiasm for criminally prosecuting the kinds of leaks that are essential to a free press.\n\nThe Sterling case - especially in light of Obama's complicity in the cover-up of torture during the Bush administration - sends a clear message to people in government service: You won't get in trouble as long as you do what you're told (even torture people). But if you talk to a reporter and tell him something we want kept secret, we will spare no effort to destroy you.\n\nThere's really no sign any more of the former community organizer who joyously declared on his first full day in office that \"there's been too much secrecy in this city... Starting today, every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who seek to make it known.\"\n\nInstead, as author Scott Horton explained to me a few weeks ago, Obama's thinking on these issues was swayed by John Brennan, the former senior adviser he eventually named CIA director. And for Brennan and his ilk, secrecy is a core value -- partly for legitimate national security reasons and partly as an impregnable shield against embarrassment and accountability.\n\nThe Sterling case was until recently an even more direct attack on a free press, as Obama administration prosecutors repeatedly demanded testimony from New York Times reporter James Risen, who wrote about the botched plot against the Iranian government that they charged Sterling with divulging.\n\nRisen's testimony was crucial to their case, they said - although evidently it wasn't. And their argument was that U.S. law recognizes no such thing as reporter's privilege when a journalist received what the government considers an illegal leak.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder finally retreated from that particular attack on press freedom earlier this month, as my colleague Lynn Oberlander explained. Holder also announced revisions of DOJ policy on questioning journalists or obtaining information from media organizations about their sources. But as Oberlander put it, \"the policy still leaves a fair amount of leeway for national security investigations -- some of the most important reporting often based on confidential sources.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former CIA officer John Kiriakou is in prison, serving the last days of his over two-year sentence not for torturing anyone, but for revealing information on torture to a reporter.\n\nStephen Kim, a former State Department official who pled guilty to leaking classified information to a Fox News reporter, faces 13 months in prison.\n\nAnd Thomas Drake, a former NSA official who provided classified information about mismanagement at his agency to a Baltimore Sun reporter, endured a four-year persecution by the government that the federal judge in his case called \"unconscionable,\" before prosecutors dropped all 10 felony charges and settled for a single guilty plea on a misdemeanor. The government's message nevertheless was loud and clear. As secrecy expert Steven Aftergood told me: \"In every significant sense, the government won, because it demonstrated the price of nonconformity.\"\n\nAll of this has been happening during a two-decade-long shift in the cultural norms of the U.S. government, whereby reporters are now routinely blocked from communicating with staff unless they are tracked and/or monitored by public relations controllers.\n\nAnd government officials are being told very clearly that their personal right to free speech does not extend to their work life, nowhere more clearly than in the intelligence community, where a new directive forbids employees from discussing \"intelligence-related information\" with a reporter unless they have specific authorization to do so, even if it's unclassified.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Obama administration has flunked transparency scorecards and has failed to follow the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nBy contrast, neither Obama nor Holder ever seriously contemplated any kind of prosecution or accountability for the application of torture - a heinous assault on human rights - that was rampant during the Bush era. Holder repeatedly and effusively ruled out any possible prosecution of those who followed orders they were told were legal. And Obama made it clear that he would not second-guess the people who gave the orders - a prima facie case of what my colleague Glenn Greenwald calls elite immunity.\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, the prospects are grim. None of the major candidates for president have said anything half as powerful about openness, transparency and accountability as Obama did. And look where that got us.",

Stiviano's claims in November, which allowed the Sterling parties to seek attorneys' fees.\n\nShelly Sterling's attorney, Caroline Heindel, said that the countersuit allegations that her client defamed Stiviano via the national news media by calling her a thief and claiming she embezzled funds and other properties from Donald Sterling were unclear.\n\nHeindel also represents L.A. Sports Properties and the Sterling family trust.\n\nStiviano's countersuit was so vague, Heindel said, that an Internet search was performed in order to see if there was anything to support her allegations.\n\nHeindel sought to compensate her clients getting Stiviano's complain tossed through attorneys' fees and costs. The former owner's estranged wife had asked for $40,460, while the trust and L.A. Sports Properties wanted approximately $19,800.\n\nThe three parties involved also asked for another $10,000 to pay for additional costs related to the motions to obtain the attorneys' fees.\n\nFruin ultimately granded the attorneys' fees, but with a total of $11,500 in deductions.\n\nMac Nehoray, Stiviano's attorney, claimed that the amount being sought by the Sterling parties was \"outrageous\" and urged Fruin to award a lesser amount.\n\n\"They're billing for something a clerk could have done,\" Nehoray said.\n\nOn March 7, Shelly Sterling filed a lawsuit in an effort to get property given to Stiviano, which was jointly owned by the Sterlings. That suit alleged that Stiviano, who would often attend Clippers games with Donald, met him at the 2010 Super Bowl and began a sexual relationship with him.\n\nDonald Sterling, who paid $12.5 million to obtain the Clippers in 1981, was pressured to sell the team after the release of recorded conversations between him and Stiviano.\n\nIn those conversations, Sterling criticized Stiviano for taking pictures with black people and told her not to bring black people to Clippers games. Those comments resulted in Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA, issued by commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nAfter a lengthy legal battle last Summer, Shelly Sterling sold the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion.",

There were only about 100 of these London Sterling limos produced with this specific vehicle being the 68th produced from Checker Motors USA which can be verified on the plaque inside the rear passenger compartment. This Sterling limo was owned by the late Merv Griffin from the early 1990's until 2007 and is authenticated by a letter from his son Tony Griffin. It was used for transporting various VIP's to and from shopping or even the airport. The VIP's that he would ferry around town to lunches and wherever they wanted to go includes Carey Grant, Elizabeth Taylor and numerous trips with President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. This Sterling is presented in its original white exterior color with original white vinyl texture top with The Beverly Hilton lettering and original gray cloth interior which includes a minibar cabinet, adjustable reading lights that come down from overhead as well as rear seats that have pushed back to give the passenger extra leg room. The interior also includes two fold down jump seats, a glass partition with moveable cloth drapes for privacy from the back seat, air conditioning, power windows and cigarette lighter on each side with a center arm rest for comfort. The London Sterling is powered by a 2.3L 4 cylinder Ford engine and automatic transmission with cruise control, power steering and brakes that have barely been used and shows roughly 10,000 original documented miles on the odometer. The Sterling limo rides smoothly and quietly on 16 inch steel wheels wrapped with Firestone wide white wall tires and custom chrome London Coach hub caps. This London Sterling would make a great addition to any collection as a vehicle that truly stands alone with the provenance to back up this beautiful and elegant piece of Hollywood history.",

Sterling is in good form at the moment, but he is very far from the finished article, and according to Manchester United legend Paul Scholes, the youngster has a glaring weakness to his game that needs to be rectified.\n\nIn his weekend column for The Independent, Scholes observed:\n\n\"I don't rate him [Sterling] that highly as a striker of the ball.\n\n\"I feel that the weakness in his game is his strike. His touch is good. His problem is the hit. Too often his shots are a scuff or a bobble\".\n\nSterling's own comments on his finishing seem to support Scholes' contention here. After scoring against Chelsea in the League Cup last week, he noted:\n\n\"I got to the edge of the box and thought I would shoot. It scuffed into the back of the net so it was a lucky finish\"\n\nWatching \u00a320m-rated Sterling play over the last two years, it's clear that his shots-per-goal ratio is not the greatest, and that may be partially due to the 'weakness' highlighted by Scholes. Some stats from this season:\n\n* Total shots: 38\n\n* Shots per game: 1.8\n\n* Shots per goal: 9.5\n\n* Shooting accuracy: 55%\n\nAs the stats show, Sterling needs 9.5 shots per goal, which suggests that many of his shots are either not on target, or - for whatever reason - not powerful enough to beat the keeper. In both instances, scuffed/bobbled shots may be a contributing reason.\n\nSterling definitely needs to tighten up his finishing, but he's only 20, so improvement in his area will (hopefully) come naturally as his experience level increases.\n\nUltimately, as long as Sterling's scuffed-shots end up in the back of the net (like the Chelsea game), then it's not really a problem.\n\nAuthor: Jaimie K",

Howard Crooks, a pipe-chewing former Marine and fierce advocate of journalistic integrity and his beloved Sterling, died Sunday, Dec. 28, in the northeastern Colorado town he cherished. He was 89.\n\nCrooks was born Dec. 23, 1925, in Fort Morgan to James Howard and J. Marie Hansen Crooks Sr. He graduated from Sterling High School in 1943.\n\nCrooks never strayed far from Sterling and was feted for his support of vocational and educational programs at local schools and at Northeastern Junior College. One of his proudest moments was receiving the \"Colorado Vocational Association's Merit Award to a Friend.\"\n\nBut it was through his 40-year career in journalism, particularly at the Sterling Journal-Advocate, that he influenced hundreds of young reporters. On their first day at the Journal-Advocate, Crooks drove new reporting hires around Sterling to introduce them to the town's movers and shakers.\n\nMost often, they were not mayors or city council members but shopkeepers, bar owners and farmers.\n\nDelinda Korrey, a University of Colorado graduate, worked for Crooks both as a reporter and editor. He was a man who appeared gruff but worked hard to instill in his young charges the value of a good, honestly reported story, Korrey said.\n\n\"J. Howard will always symbolize a part of journalism's history when newspapers were the major form of information -- when accuracy was much more important than speed, and content was more valuable than cash flow,\" she said. \"Howard believed that each one of us has a story to tell. Granted, some of the stories may not be worth repeating, but each person's story mattered.\"\n\nCrooks enlisted in the U.S. Marines during World War II and served as a machine gunner in the Pacific until his discharge in 1946.\n\nHe returned to Sterling and attended Northeastern Junior College, where he studied for two years before joining the then-Sterling Daily Advocate in 1948.\n\nIn August 1950, he married Alberta M. Reedy in Brush. Crooks was called to active duty as a Marine correspondent in Korea until 1952, serving as a combat journalist.\n\nIn 1953, Crooks came home and became the managing editor of the Sterling Journal-Advocate. Four years later, he moved to Alamosa, where he served as the sports editor of the Alamosa Valley Courier.\n\nCrooks returned to Sterling in 1960 and became a general assignment reporter for the Journal-Advocate. He worked his way through management until he was named the editor emeritus of the newspaper on June 30, 1985. He officially retired from the newspaper on Dec. 31, 1990.",

Poor striking of the ball often equates to poor finishing, and one of the Premier League's greatest ever strikers appears to agree with Scholes' assessment.\n\nIn his weekend column for The Independent, Scholes observed:\n\n\"I don't rate him [Sterling] that highly as a striker of the ball.\n\n\"I feel that the weakness in his game is his strike. His touch is good. His problem is the hit. Too often his shots are a scuff or a bobble\".\n\nAfter Liverpool's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea on Tuesday, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry praised Sterling's 'frightening' ability, but also highlighted a tangentially related issue:\n\n\"What he [Sterling] doesn't have yet is finishing. He struggles with it sometimes but that will come with time. He has everything you need. He's good one vs one, he has pace, and his movements are sharp\".\n\nIn a previous article, I highlighted Sterling's shots-per-goal ratio (13 shots per goal), but I only included Premier League stats. In all competitions:\n\n* Total Appearances: 32\n\n* Total shots: 86\n\n* Goals: 7\n\n* Shots on target: 40\n\n* Shots per game: 2.6\n\n* Shots per goal: 12.2\n\n* Shooting accuracy: 48%\n\nStats: ESPN\n\nThese stats clearly show that Scholes and Henry and correct with their assertions. To illustrate the point further: Liverpool have failed to win any of the last three games (Chelsea x2/Bolton), and Sterling's shooting stats for those matches are as follows:\n\n* Total shots: 12\n\n* Shots on target: 3\n\n* Shooting accuracy: 25%\n\n\u00a326m-rated Sterling was pretty anonymous against Chelsea on Tuesday, and unless his shooting/finishing improves, his chances of developing into a top-class striker seem slim.\n\nWhen Daniel Sturridge returns, the Sterling-as-striker experiment will hopefully come to an end, and he should revert back to the number 10 role and/or playing wide in a front-three.\n\nUnless, of course, Rodgers reverts to a 352 and plays Sterling and Sturridge up front together...\n\nAuthor: Jaimie K",

                    "body": "* Gruesome torture practices reveal U.S. government as massive criminal enterprise.\n\nWARNING: This report is not for the fainthearted. Readers who might be easily disturbed by descriptions of savage cruelty are asked to proceed with caution.\n\nBy Ronald L. Ray --\n\nDiabolical. That is the only word to describe the grotesque savagery of so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" -- known to normal people as torture -- employed by the United States military and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) against alleged \"terrorist suspects.\" \"Torture\" is the only word suitable to describe the perverse perpetrators of such vicious cruelty for purposes of \"national security,\" who have gained ignoble power since the CIA/Mossad false-flag attacks against the U.S. on September 11, 2001. But for all the hoopla surrounding the partial publication of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA detention and interrogation practices, it is only part of the sordid story.\n\nGerman journalist Dr. Juergen Todenhoefer and his son are fearless investigators of the other side of the \"War on Terror,\" returning in December 2014 with first-hand reports about the Islamic State (ISIS) and its militia fighters. Todenhoefer published an account in his most recent book, Thou Shalt Not Kill, that sears the mind and heart with the events it recalls, and which has been summarized by the news and commentary website, \"AlterNet.\"\n\nBagram, Afghanistan, is home to one of the most notorious torture prisons operated by the U.S., where unspeakable brutality coexists in close proximity to a McDonald's fast-food restaurant and other expressions of \"the American way.\" Here, Todenhoefer reports, a Canadian soldier-turned-mercenary, identified as \"Jack,\" related why he could no longer bear working at Bagram: \"It's not my thing when Afghans get raped by dogs.\"\n\nAccording to Todenhoefer, Afghan prisoners would be tied to a small chair, face down, and then vicious fighting dogs would be sent into the room. If a prisoner revealed nothing useful, each of the dogs would be allowed to sodomize the hapless victim in turn. \"After procedures like these, they confessed everything. They would have even said that they killed Kennedy without even knowing who he was,\" said Jack.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the U.S. hanged at least one Japanese general for \"waterboarding\" Allied prisoners, a practice defined by the Americans as torture. It is a particularly terrifying experience, pouring water over a person's covered face for extended periods, nearly to the point of drowning. Victims will confess to almost anything -- even things they or their acquaintances never committed -- just to end the experience.\n\nYet in the 21st century, the U.S. federal government no longer considers this malicious practice torture. Waterboarding has become the battle flag of the neoconservatives' surveillance state, with former Vice President Dick Cheney as its greatest cheerleader.\n\nOther prisoners were stripped naked and viciously beaten, blindfolded and repeatedly slammed against cement walls, or tormented with blaring (sometimes satanic) music for days on end. Still others were deprived of sleep for up to a week at a time -- leading to psychotic events like hallucinations -- or deprived of food for extended periods, subjected to severe sensory deprivation, immersed in ice water and physically restrained in excruciatingly painful positions while naked.\n\nSome of the detainees were subjected to forced \"rectal rehydration\" or \"rectal feeding\" (enemas) without medical necessity or supervision. In one case, the CIA even tortured two of its own operatives. But when the two men sought redress in court for the Bush-era events, the Obama administration got the lawsuit thrown out.\n\nAnd ever since stories began to leak out about CIA and military brutality, which extended even to non-terrorists, \"The Company\" has destroyed evidence, spied on U.S. senators, and lied and fought vehemently to prevent a full accounting of its criminal misdeeds.\n\nStill the neocons and warmongers make every excuse and defend the indefensible. Republicans on the Senate committee nitpicked over details and whined that exposing the truth might put the U.S. in a bad international light or endanger the perpetrators. Such sycophantic behavior makes them accomplices to war crimes. A rare exception was Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who for once had the courage to condemn the CIA activities for what they are: torture.\n\nCheney, in fact, admitted that the sadistic enterprise was not a \"rogue operation,\" but rather a program known and authorized at the highest levels. He even declared that the torturers \"deserve a lot of praise. . . . As far as I'm concerned, they ought to be decorated, not criticized.\"\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that the devilishly bestial activities of the CIA and military torture programs are not only grossly immoral but a violation of federal (18 U.S.C. \u00a72340A) and international law. They are entirely reprehensible among\n\ncivilized peoples.\n\nIt is time to put an end to the CIA. Bush, Obama, Cheney and the entire crew of evildoers, down to the perpetrators in the prisons, must be punished. Far from receiving war medals, they deserve to have something significantly more constrictive hung around their necks.",

Don't forget to stay tuned to Celeb Dirty Laundry where we will be live blogging every episode of State of Affairs first season. While you wait for the recap, check out a sneak peek of tonight's episode below!\n\nTonight's episode begins now - Refresh Page often to get the most current updates!\n\nPayton is taking heat for Green's death at the hands of AR. There are calls for impeachment. Payton works on a speech. She says an attack by AR doesn't warrant an attack on our Constitution. She says no to profiling and discrimination but says if you are a member of AR, if you persist in waging war against the US, you will be hunted down. A woman stands up and yells that she's a tyrant and must be impeached. A man throws a bottle and they hustle her off the stage and into her limo.\n\nThe motorcade speeds away and David says her critics see her as using the CIA as her royal guard. He cites the treatment of Professor Ahmadi. She says she's terrified about where the next bomb will go off - a subway or a spelling bee. He says it would be different if they were getting results. He tells her this could bring down her presidency and encourages her to assign an outside investigator and let the CIA burn if they're guilty. She says they have to control it and suggests Senator Burke.\n\nCharlie goes to where some terrorists are being held. They talk to Kenneth, one of the terrorists and let him know what fate awaits him. She asks where the bombs are. He tells her - we are your brothers, sisters, fathers, children. The others take up the chant. Charlie walks out annoyed. She goes to brief Payton. She says Nick's intel isn't helping. She says no one has given them the lab or bomb locations. She says Nick is with Fatah and will let them know when they are close to the Sheikh.\n\nPayton says Fatah can't walk away from this. Charlie says she knows this and she tells her to make sure Nick knows it too. Mo asks Charlie if she has news. They discuss looking for a missing link and wonder what the link between the seven is and how they met. Lucas says they weren't recruited in the traditional sense, they drifted toward AR. They wonder how they found each other and how they communicated with Al Moosari.\n\nIn the Philippines, Fatah and Nick creep through a grassy region and then come face to face with other men. It turns into gunfire and then Fatah and Nick run after taking out the other men. They hide as other soldiers run by. Then they are surrounded. Nick tells them to put their weapons down. But then the soldiers are shot by snipers and they're free again. Fatah asks what that was. Nick isn't sure. Burke comes to see Payton and he says he admires that she's willing to investigate the CIA.\n\nHe says he'll do what he can. She says they can hold a joint presser and announce it. He says he doesn't want Senator Owen to run it and she asks who. She reminds him he's an opposition party member and he says he would be a non-voting committee head. She says if turns into a witch hunt, that's an issue. He says he doesn't want powerful enemies, he wants an end to terrorist threats on their soul. Dash comes to get Charlie and says he found something.\n\nExtremeTruth.net has a message board and all seven were on there but the site has since been shut down but the private messages weren't on the cache. Ahmadi owned the site and that's the problem since he hates them. Fatah tries to figure out who saved them. Nick says it's not the CIA and says they wouldn't shoot Filipinos. Fatah says they have to move on to meet the Sheikh. The other man says the people following them must be dead before they can go on.\n\nHe tells Fatah to send Nick to make sure all the men are dead. Charlie goes to see Ahmadi. She asks about the website and says she's an analyst with the CIA. He reminds her they accused him of being a terrorist. She says anything that inspires terrorism is just as bad as terrorism. She tells him the American members of AR were recruited through his website. He says he came to America to feel safe and enjoy democracy and the rule of law. He says the CIA showed him what he came for was a lie.\n\nShe says she wants access to the servers. She says she's trying to save lives. Charlie comes back to the CIA and she got the access. Dash says she's been summoned to the conference room. Senator Burke is there. He says there's a congressional committee being formed to address the abuses of the agency. She tells him to take it up with the director. He tells her he's in a hospital bed and that's not appropriate. She says this isn't either.\n\nHe says he won't make this a witch hunt as long as nobody acts like a witch. Acting Director Banks shows up and says this interview is over. He says until the committee has a name, purpose and subpoenas, don't come in my building, park in my lot or come to my office. He tells him if he wants to be stroked to go to a massage parlor and says this is Langley, not Capitol Hill. He tells his men to escort him out. And out he goes.\n\nBanks tells Charlie the investigation is a catapult of crap and to keep her head down so it flies over her head. Nick calls and says he has 30 seconds. He asks if there are guardian angels on his op. She says no. He says he has to do something and it's better she doesn't know. She says try to get back in one piece. He says that's the plan. Kurt is in his office reading an article about the attack on Navarro. Victor comes in and says the spy game takes its toll.\n\nHe says we are not paid well for what we do and what we lose. He asks if he's a cowboy. He says if he's not, he asks why the hell is he driving a pickup in DC. He tells him he has a real job and tells him to get a real car. He leaves him a black credit card and another card. Banks comes to see Payton and she says she heard Burke came to see him today. He says Burke is trying to lay out Navarro and he doesn't care. Banks says he didn't vote for her or anybody and will shield his people.\n\nShe says they should just give him what he wants within reason. Charlie says it was Burke and Mo says the rumors are true. Charlie says the focus is likely to be on them and they say Kurt is likely to be get hit hard. Lucas says he's the sequel to Aldrich Ames. Kurt is at a Mercedes dealership looking at $150k cars. They ask if he wants it bulletproof. He laughs but they tell him they're not kidding. Payton heads to Green's service. She hugs Green's daughter and tells her she's sorry she lost her.\n\nShe says they had their differences but they were friends before they were politicians. Her dad comes out and says she's not welcome. He says she's only there for her poll numbers but his daughter says she invited her and he says no photos for exploitation. Dash says they found two of the seven talking about picking up term papers at a certain address where they're no school. Nick looks at foot prints in the mud. Some guys in extreme camo sneak through the swamp. Nick shoots one.\n\nThe other runs into the woods. When he checks on the one, the guy tries to choke him. He breaks his neck and then the other guy speaks to him in American English saying - you were told to stay away. He checks the dead one and sees an Airborne Ranger tattoo. The other one that ran away pulls off his head gear and curses - it's Syd! Payton looks through a photo album when Marshall comes in. He says he thought she was already in bed. She says she has a lot on her mind.\n\nShe asks how his speech was. He says he pulled in a crowd of eight. He asks how the bomb factory search is going and she says Charlie thinks they're close. He says okay and asks what else is on her mind. She asks why he didn't tell her he went to Kyle's viewing. He says it was last minute and she says she was passing him passing classified photos and was sleeping with him. He says he thought they were done keeping score but he was crying at her wake. He says 10 years was long enough.\n\nShe says she's forgiving but not forgetting. She says she gave him information about their son as a friend that she refused him as a wife. Nick comes back to Fatah and says it's done. He says he killed one and the other ran off. Fatah demands the gun and Nick hands it over. They head off to the camp. Kurt speeds along in his fancy new car playing loud music. He pulls off the road and gets out. He looks at the car and opens the back door. He searches all over the exterior and then finally finds a tracker. He curses.\n\nCharlie and the gang are searching the building at that address with a bomb robot. They find a line of backpacks. Seven of them. The robot tries to unzip one but can't. They send a guy in wearing a Hurt Locker suit. He unzips it and confirms it's a bomb. He says he can defuse. He cuts it and moves on to the next. He starts to open the next bag and the whole building blows. Charlie goes to brief Payton on the incident. She says they found the site where they were storing the bombs for the attack.\n\nShe says a bomb technician was caught in the blast but says thousands of lives could have been lost otherwise. She says Ahmadi helped them by giving access to his servers. Payton says he's a true patriot and it's a rare thing nowadays. Charlie asks if she's okay and she says she's tired and never wanted this thing to start and now wants it to be over. She says the AR Seven need to be moved to a transparent site and allowed access to lawyers and medical professionals.\n\nShe says she heard Banks stepped in hard on her interview with Burke. Charlie says it was pretty great. Payton says Burke will make a lot of noise while the two of them take out Hakam and Fatah. She says Burke will target the CIA while they erase the greatest threat in recent history. They clink their glasses in a toast. Over at Burke's office, box after box of CIA files are delivered to him. He opens a folder and sees that nearly every word has been redacted.\n\nKurt looks at his desk and tosses his briefcase down. Victor crushes a pill and takes it with whiskey as Kurt comes in and thanks him. He hands back the black credit card and the GPS tracker. Kurt says the money, car and job is recruitment not recon and says he's surprised he hasn't found a hooker in his bed. He asks what Victor really wants and he says he wants him to tell him everything about Fatah and Bellerephon.\n\nCharlie watches the news coverage of the explosion of the bomb site. Mo comes in and says the bombs are off the streets. She reminds her that she taught her to never second guess the trade offs. Mo says there's some actions in the Philippines and says it's an American body. Charlie says if Nick killed an American during an unsanctioned op, he'll burn either way. Ahmadi gets a letter. It's a thank you card from Payton for his service to the United States of America.\n\nHe puts it in his desk then goes to a secret door in his closet and opens it up. We see hanging racks of bomb components.",

En el centro, un programa de la CIA para sabotear el sistema nuclear de Ir\u00e1n. Es uno de los nueve casos en los que la Administraci\u00f3n del presidente Barack Obama se ha querellado contra un esp\u00eda por filtrar informaci\u00f3n a la prensa. Y ha vuelto a ganar.\n\nJeffrey Sterling fue condenado este lunes por nueve cargos que abarcan desde revelar informaci\u00f3n relativa a la \"seguridad nacional\" a James Risen, periodista y escritor del Times, hasta obstrucci\u00f3n a la justicia. El exagente, de 47 a\u00f1os, permanecer\u00e1 en libertad hasta el 24 de abril, cuando conozca su sentencia, tras pasar los \u00faltimos cinco a\u00f1os intentando demostrar su inocencia.\n\nEl Fiscal General, Eric Holder, ha calificado la decisi\u00f3n del jurado en contra de Sterling como \"justa y apropiada\". Seg\u00fan el responsable del Departamento de Justicia, \"las filtraciones pusieron vidas en peligro y constituyeron una grave violaci\u00f3n de la confianza depositada por los ciudadanos\" en el agente.\n\nEl Gobierno ha asegurado durante el desarrollo de este caso que Sterling actu\u00f3 por despecho tras ser despedido de la CIA en 2003. El exagente habr\u00eda contactado con Risen para denunciar lo que consideraba un caso de discriminaci\u00f3n laboral, aunque despu\u00e9s acab\u00f3 proporcion\u00e1ndole m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre el programa en el que hab\u00eda trabajado y que ten\u00eda como objetivo sabotear el sistema nuclear iran\u00ed.\n\nEl caso de Sterling cobr\u00f3 especial relevancia en EE UU por estar implicado un periodista del diario m\u00e1s importante del pa\u00eds y que declar\u00f3 estar dispuesto a ingresar en prisi\u00f3n antes que revelar su fuente. Seg\u00fan el Gobierno, la persona de la que recibi\u00f3 datos para su libro 'State of War' siempre fue Sterling, quien no s\u00f3lo dio detalles de las operaciones en las que estuvo implicado, sino que tambi\u00e9n puso en peligro a otros agentes.\n\nLa negativa de Risen reabri\u00f3 adem\u00e1s un debate entre los medios estadounidenses sobre la protecci\u00f3n de sus periodistas en casos como \u00e9ste. El Gobierno no se querell\u00f3 contra el escritor, pero s\u00ed le exigi\u00f3 que revelara su fuente. A pesar de que el derecho a la confidencialidad sobre el origen de la informaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 reconocido en varios pa\u00edses e instituciones internacionales, el Gobierno federal de EE UU no lo estipula, por lo que Risen pod\u00eda haber ido a prisi\u00f3n.\n\nEl debate sobre la protecci\u00f3n de reporteros ha llegado hasta el Congreso, donde se debati\u00f3 la creaci\u00f3n de una nueva ley 'escudo' para la prensa. La presi\u00f3n del Gobierno sobre los filtradores y los autores que puedan recibir su informaci\u00f3n ha aumentado durante la Administraci\u00f3n Obama, que ha demandado a m\u00e1s exesp\u00edas que todos sus predecesores juntos, coincide adem\u00e1s con un aumento de las filtraciones. Solo en los \u00faltimos cinco a\u00f1os han salido a la luz los documentos revelados por la exsoldado Chelsea Manning a Wikileaks, o los de Edward Snowden a The Guardian y The Washington Post, exponiendo secretos del Departamento de Estado, el Pent\u00e1gono y la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional.\n\nEl Departamento de Justicia anunci\u00f3 finalmente que no sentar\u00eda al periodista en el banquillo durante el juicio. El fiscal Holder, centro de la mayor\u00eda de las cr\u00edticas contra la Administraci\u00f3n durante este caso, conced\u00eda as\u00ed una de las peticiones tanto de Risen como del Times. \"Como demuestra este veredicto, es posible perseguir totalmente las revelaciones de informaci\u00f3n no autorizadas que da\u00f1an nuestra seguridad nacional sin interferir con el trabajo de los periodistas\", dijo Holder en su comunicado. La suerte de Sterling, sin embargo, no fue la misma.",

Creo que las plantas de autos les han abierto los ojos\".\n\nSeg\u00fan David Sterling, presidente y CEO de la ferroviaria Kansas City Southern, las plantas automotrices que han abierto en M\u00e9xico los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os han basado gran parte de su decisi\u00f3n en la eficiencia de los trenes de carga. En el reporte anual de KSU, el directivo se\u00f1al\u00f3 que \"el gobierno (mexicano) entiende hoy qu\u00e9 tan importante es el ferrocarril para el crecimiento de la econom\u00eda mexicana. Creo que las plantas de autos les han abierto los ojos. Entienden que estas plantas automotrices no se habr\u00edan puesto en M\u00e9xico de no haber sido por sus trenes y su eficiencia\".\n\nY KSU le ha sacado provecho a ese factor. Tanto as\u00ed que el boom en la industria automotriz en M\u00e9xico es tan relevante que el negocio que les genera alcanza a compensar los efectos negativos de la volatilidad en los precios internacionales del crudo y la depreciaci\u00f3n del peso.\n\nLa firma reci\u00e9n entreg\u00f3 sus resultados del cuarto trimestre y a\u00f1o completo 2014 y, aunque resintieron el efecto del cambio del d\u00f3lar y el combustible m\u00e1s caro en M\u00e9xico (ambos representaron 2 puntos negativos en el crecimiento total de la empresa), no ven razones m\u00e1s que para el optimismo.\n\nLas exportaciones de autos terminados y de autopartes, junto con los muebles de l\u00ednea blanca y electr\u00f3nica, son una muestra de que el \"fen\u00f3meno nearshoring\" funciona, dice Sterling. \u00c9l hace referencia a la tendencia de firmas de EU y otros pa\u00edses a trasladar sus operaciones de manufactura de China o de otros pa\u00edses asi\u00e1ticos a Norteam\u00e9rica y, seg\u00fan Sterling, \"eso ha sido bueno para nuestro negocio en M\u00e9xico\".\n\nEso y las inversiones de las armadoras de autos en el pa\u00eds. Como se recordar\u00e1, en lo que va del sexenio de Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, la industria automotriz atrajo inversiones por 19 mil millones de d\u00f3lares, incluyendo plantas nuevas y ampliaciones como la de General Motors de 5 mil millones los pr\u00f3ximos cuatro a\u00f1os.\n\n\"No vemos que estas inversiones, como la de General Motors, se detengan\", dice Sterling. \"Hemos hablado mucho de las plantas. Sabemos que hay m\u00e1s fabricantes que est\u00e1n buscando sitios en M\u00e9xico, as\u00ed que esto todav\u00eda no termina. As\u00ed que creemos que lo del peso y lo del costo del combustible a fin de cuenta ser\u00e1 algo positivo\".",
