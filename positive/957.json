                    "body": "Documents: Hector Monsegur betrayed several major hacking groups\nThe celebrity hacker \"Sabu\" helped the FBI imprison his friends and stop more than 300 cyber-attacks in the three years since he betrayed several major hacking groups.\n That's according to new U.S. government documents that for the first time provide extensive detail about what they call the \"extremely valuable and productive\" undercover cooperation of Hector Monsegur.\n Monsegur used the Sabu moniker online, where he was a member of the hacking collectives Anonymous and LulzSec.\n At his sentencing on Tuesday, a New York federal judge said Monsegur would not get any more jail time in addition to the seven months he has already served.  He will spend one year on supervised release.\n Though Monsegur faced up to 26 years in prison for the $2.5 million in losses connected to his hacks, the government sought leniency.\n Prosecutors said his work on behalf of the FBI helped thwart attacks on websites belonging to the U.S. military, NASA and media companies, among others.  The FBI relocated him and his family because he received threats for his cooperation, the court documents say.\n Monsegur was part of a group of hackers that became notorious in 2011 for breaking into or disabling U.S. government and corporate websites.  The Anonymous-affiliated groups LulzSec and Internet Feds targeted sites including PBS, Fox Television, Nintendo and Sony Pictures.  Their public boasts on Twitter and elsewhere on the Internet drew them instant celebrity as so-called hacktivists, because they often claimed to make a political point in their activities.\n The documents show that in June 2011, FBI agents visited Monsegur's apartment in a public housing project in Manhattan's lower east side.  They confronted him about his activities and he immediately agreed to become an informant.\n He agreed to a guilty plea, returned to his apartment and was back online in hours -- this time, working for the FBI.\n His assistance helped the FBI investigate and net LulzSec and Internet Feds members, including the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminal, Jeremy Hammond, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence, prosecutors said in court documents.\n \"Working sometimes literally around the clock, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur engaged his co-conspirators in online chats that were critical to confirming their identities and whereabouts,\" prosecutors said.  \"During some of the online chats, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur convinced LulzSec members to provide him digital evidence of the hacking activities they claimed to have previously engaged in, such as logs regarding particular criminal hacks.\" \"\nHis quick cooperation was key, according to the documents, because LulzSec had established a protocol to destroy computer evidence if any of their members went missing or was arrested.\n \"Monsegur admitted to engaging in hacking activities about which the government had not previously developed evidence,\" prosecutors said.  He hacked thousands of computers, at first in a bid to build a legitimate computer security company and then to steal and pay his bills, prosecutors said.\n Monsegur's cooperation with the FBI became public when he was arrested in 2012 for making unauthorized online postings, violating his cooperation agreement.\n Upon the news, Anonymous members hacked a computer-security website and posted an open letter to Sabu.  It read: \"Sabu snitched on us.  As usually happens FBI menaced him to take his sons away.  We understand, but we were your family too (remember what you liked to say?) It's sad and we can't imagine how it feels having to look at the mirror each morning and see there the guy who shopped their friends to [the] police.\" \"",

                    "body": "Photo: Newton Grafitti/Flickr\nAs a reward for his extensive cooperation helping prosecutors hunt down his fellow hackers, the government is seeking time served for the long-awaited sentencing of top LulzSec leader Hector Xavier Monsegur, also known as \"Sabu.\" \"\nAfter delaying his sentencing for nearly three years, the government has asked a federal court to sentence Monsegur to time served -- just seven months -- calling him an \"extremely valuable and productive cooperator\" in a document that details for the first time his extensive cooperation providing \"unprecedented access to LulzSec.\" \"\nMonsegur, who has long been despised by members of LulzSec for his reported snitching, faced a possible sentence of between 259 and 317 months imprisonment under U.S. sentencing guidelines.  But the U.S. Probation Office and prosecutors have asked for a reduced sentence \"without regard to the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum sentence in this case\" in a motion submitted to the U.S. District Court (.p pdf) in the Southern District of New York on Friday.\n A top leader of the hacking group LulzSec, Monsegur turned informant after he was secretly approached by authorities in June 2011, providing information that led to the subsequent arrest of other top members of LuzSec and Anonymous, including Jeremy Hammond, aka \"Anarchaos\"of Chicago, who was sentenced last year for his role in the hack of private intelligence firm, Stratfor.\n The court document provides a timeline of events around Monsegur's cooperation with authorities that many have suspected for years, including his efforts to draw fellow hackers into incriminating conversations.\n Calling his cooperation \"complex and sophisticated\" the document describes, for example, his close involvement with law enforcement agencies in several jurisdictions to investigate Hammond in Chicago, while coordinating with FBI agents in New York, physical surveillance teams deployed in Chicago, and an electronic surveillance unit in Washington, D.C.\nHammond was sentenced last year to ten years in prison.\n Monsegur, an unemployed father of two, formed LulzSec in the spring of 2011 with about five other core members, who went on a rampage over the next couple of months, targeting about 250 victims, including media outlets, government agencies and contractors, and private companies during their crime spree.  Monsegur led the loosely organized group of hackers from his apartment in a public housing project in New York, working as a key player to analyzed victim web sites for vulnerabilities that could be exploited and providing other technical assistance.\n The group, which also operated under the name Internet Feds, hacked a number of high-profile victims including HB Gary -- a private intelligence firm that bragged it had identified members of Anonymous -- the reality TV show \"X-Factor,\" PBS, Sony Pictures, Senate.g gov, Nintendo, and a Georgia-based affiliate of the FBI's Infragard organization.\n Monsegur, as Sabu, was one of the most outspoken and brazen of the LulzSec crew before falling silent that summer, leaving behind a parting Tweet that quoted the The Usual Suspects film.\n When he reappeared in September, many members of the anonymous hacking group suspected that Sabu had been arrested, since fellow hackers had outed him by publishing information about his identity online.  Sabu denied at the time that he'd been snagged by the feds.  But according to the government's motion, his demise as leader of LulzSec was swift and painless and within hours after being interviewed by authorities, \"he was back online cooperating proactively.\" \"\nAccording to the document, authorities approached Monsegur at his New York home on June 7, 2011 at which point he needed little convincing to cooperate.  He quickly admitted guilt to criminal conduct before he was even charged with any crime and even spilled the beans to authorities about past crimes he had committed for which they had no knowledge of his role.\n He admitted, for example, to participating in DDoS attacks against PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa, which were targeted after the companies blocked donations to WikiLeaks.  Monsegur also admitted to hacking thousands of computers between 1999 and 2004, engaging in various hacktivism activities as well as carding activity -- stealing and selling credit card information for financial gain or to pay off his own bills.  He also admitting to selling marijuana, illegally possessing an unlicensed firearm, and purchasing stolen electronics and jewelry.\n \"Monsegur admitted his criminal conduct and immediately agreed to cooperate with law enforcement,\" the document notes.  \"That night, Monsegur reviewed his computer files with FBI agents and provided actionable information to law enforcement.  The next morning, Monsegur appeared in court on a criminal complaint charging him with credit card fraud and identity theft, and was released on bail, whereupon he immediately continued his cooperation with the Government, as described further below.\" \"\nMonsegur entered a guilty plea to the court on August 15, 2011, for an indictment charging him with twelve counts in New York, including nine counts related to computer hacking; one count related to credit card fraud; one count of conspiring to commit bank fraud; and one count of aggravated identity theft.  The plea resolved four other cases filed against him in the Eastern and Central Districts of California, the Northern District of Georgia, and the Eastern District of Virginia).\n But Monsegur apparently violated the terms of his agreement in 2012.  According to the document, in May 2012, his bail was revoked over \"unauthorized online postings\" he made, and he was arrested on May 25th, before being released on a revised bail December 18, 2012.  Monsegur has been free since that time, while cooperating with authorities, and has spent only a total of seven months in prison since 2011.\n In court records, Monsegur was generally identified only as CW-1 and was praised extensively (.p pdf) for \"actively cooperating with the government.\" \" Authorities in fact petitioned the court several times to delay Monsegur's sentencing during his continued cooperation.\n According to authorities, part of Monsegur's post-arrest cooperation included providing information to help repair hacked systems belonging to PBS and Senate.g gov. He also provided authorities with information about hacks involving servers belonging to the Irish political party Fine Gael and the Sony Playstation Network.\n But his most extensive assistance led to the arrest of fellow LulzSec members, including Ryan Ackroyd, aka \"Kayla\" of Doncaster, United Kingdom; Jake Davis, aka \"Topiary\" of London; Darren Martyn, aka \"pwnsauce\" of Ireland; Donncha O'Cearrbhail, aka \"palladium\" of Ireland; Mustafa Al-Bassam, aka \"T-Flow\" in the UK; as well as Hammond, Ryan Cleary and Matthew Keys, a former Reuters employee accused of inciting members of Anonymous to hack one of his former employers.\n Monsegur provided \"crucial, detailed information regarding computer intrusions committed by these groups, including how the attacks occurred, which members were involved, and how the computer systems were exploited once breached,\" the government reveals.\n This assistance \"contributed directly to the identification, prosecution and conviction of eight of his major co-conspirators, including Hammond, who at the time of his arrest was the FBI's number one cybercriminal target in the world.  On top of that, Monsegur engaged in additional, substantial proactive cooperation that enabled the FBI to prevent a substantial number of planned cyber attacks,\" the government noted.\n Working at the direction of law enforcement for three years, sometimes into the late evening and early morning, Monsegur drew his fellow hackers into online chats designed to confirming their identities and whereabouts.\n \"During some of the online chats, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur convinced LulzSec members to provide him digital evidence of the hacking activities they claimed to have previously engaged in, such as logs regarding particular criminal hacks,\" the government notes.  \"When law enforcement later searched the computers of particular LulzSec members, they discovered copies of the same electronic evidence on the individuals' computers.  In this way, the online nicknames of LulzSec members were definitively linked to their true identities, providing powerful proof of their guilt.\n \"Other times, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur asked seemingly innocuous questions designed to elicit information from his co-conspirators that, when coupled with other information obtained during the investigation, could be used to pinpoint their exact locations and identities,\" the document reveals.\n Ackroyd has been sentenced to 30 months in prison; Davis was sentenced to two years in a juvenile detention facility; Al-Bassam was sentenced to 20 months, which was suspended for two years; Martyn and O'Cearrbhail received probation and a fine; Cleary was sentenced to 32 months in prison; the case of Keys is pending.\n Monsegur also helped \"disrupt or prevent at least 300 separate computer hacks\" that authorities say targeted U.S. Armed Forces, Congress, unidentified U.S. courts, NASA, and a number of private companies.\n \"Although difficult to quantify, it is likely that Monsegur's actions prevented at least millions of dollars in loss to these victims,\" the government states effusively.  \"Monsegur also provided information about vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, including at a water utility for an American city, and a foreign energy company.  Law enforcement used the information Monsegur provided to secure the water utility, and the information about the energy company was shared with appropriate government personnel.\" \"\nThe government notes that because Monsegur's cooperation was publicly exposed shortly after his arrest, he and his family faced severe threats, causing authorities to relocate him and some of his family members.\n \"Monsegur repeatedly was approached on the street and threatened or menaced about his cooperation once it became publicly known,\" prosecutors note.  \"Monsegur was also harassed by individuals who incorrectly concluded that he participated in the Government's prosecution of the operators of the Silk Road website.\" \"\nIn one case, a reporter had to be removed from the school where the journalist had sought to interview children for whom Monsegur served as guardian.\n Monsegur's sentencing is set for May 27.",

The FBI relocated him and his family because he received threats for his cooperation, the court documents say.\n Monsegur was part of a group of hackers that became notorious in 2011 for breaking into or disabling U.S. government and corporate websites.  The Anonymous-affiliated groups LulzSec and Internet Feds targeted sites including PBS, Fox Television, Nintendo and Sony Pictures.  Their public boasts on Twitter and elsewhere on the Internet drew them instant celebrity as so-called hacktivists, because they often claimed to make a political point in their activities.\n The documents show that in June 2011, FBI agents visited Monsegur's apartment in a public housing project in Manhattan's lower east side.  They confronted him about his activities and he immediately agreed to become an informant.\n He agreed to a guilty plea, returned to his apartment and was back online in hours -- this time, working for the FBI.\n His assistance helped the FBI investigate and net LulzSec and Internet Feds members, including the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminal, Jeremy Hammond, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence, prosecutors said in court documents.\n \"Working sometimes literally around the clock, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur engaged his co-conspirators in online chats that were critical to confirming their identities and whereabouts,\" prosecutors said.  \"During some of the online chats, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur convinced LulzSec members to provide him digital evidence of the hacking activities they claimed to have previously engaged in, such as logs regarding particular criminal hacks.\" \"\nHis quick cooperation was key, according to the documents, because LulzSec had established a protocol to destroy computer evidence if any of their members went missing or was arrested.\n \"Monsegur admitted to engaging in hacking activities about which the government had not previously developed evidence,\" prosecutors said.  He hacked thousands of computers, at first in a bid to build a legitimate computer security company and then to steal and pay his bills, prosecutors said.\n Monsegur's cooperation with the FBI became public when he was arrested in 2012 for making unauthorized online postings, violating his cooperation agreement.\n Upon the news, Anonymous members hacked a computer-security website and posted an open letter to Sabu.  It read: \"Sabu snitched on us.  As usually happens FBI menaced him to take his sons away.  We understand, but we were your family too (remember what you liked to say?) It's sad and we can't imagine how it feels having to look at the mirror each morning and see there the guy who shopped their friends to [the] police.\" \"",

He helped the FBI stop or mitigate roughly 300 cyber attacks estimated at millions of dollars of potential loss.  He also passed to the feds information on vulnerabilities in a US city water utility and a foreign energy firm that the feds were able to act upon in advance of any attacks.\n Among the targeted organizations were the US military, US Congress, US Courts, NASA, international intergovernmental organizations, a television network, a security company, a video game manufacturer, and an electronics conglomerate, the filing said.  \"Notably, during the period of his cooperation, Monsegur received communications from hackers about vulnerabilities in computer systems, as well as computer hacks that were being planned or carried out by them.  The FBI used this information, wherever feasible, to prevent or mitigate harm that otherwise would have occurred.\" \"\nSabu's sentencing has been delayed multiple times over the past three years, so today's hearing had long been anticipated.  He had pled guilty in exchange for assisting the FBI in catching other members of LulzSec and Anonymous.  His work with the feds resulted in the prosecution and conviction of eight members of the LulzSec collective, including Jeremy Hammond (at one time the most wanted cybercriminal in the world), who was recently sentenced to 120 months in prison.\n According to the filing by US Attorney Preet Bharara, Monsegur was quick to agree to the FBI's terms when agents first questioned him on June 7, 2011.  He handed over key information to law enforcement officials for their investigation and later confessed to other crimes the FBI had been unaware of previously.\n According to the filing:\nWorking sometimes literally around the clock, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur engaged his co-conspirators in online chats that were critical to confirming their identities and whereabout.  During some of the online chats, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur convinced LulzSec members to provide him digital evidence of the hacking activities they claimed to have previously engaged in, such as logs regarding particular criminal hacks.\n Other times, at the direction of law enforcement, Monsegur asked seemingly innocuous questions designed to elicit information from his co-conspirators that, when coupled with other information obtained during the investigation, could be used to pinpoint their exact locations and identities.  Monsegur's substantial proactive cooperation, as set forth more particularly below, contributed directly to the identification, prosecution, and conviction of eight of his co-conspirators, including Hammond.\n Sabu and members of his family also faced threats when word got out that he had helped the FBI, the filing said.  As a result, law enforcement officials moved Monsegur and some of his family members for their safety.",

He has served as an informant and aide since then, and was praised today by prosecutors, who wrote that he helped \"disrupt or prevent at least 300 hacks\" targeting the military, Congress and \"several private companies.\" \" They added, \"Monsegur's actions prevented at least millions of dollars in loss to these victims.\" \" Additionally, Sabu \"contributed directly to the identification, prosecution and conviction of eight of his major co-conspirators.\" \" Included in this figure is Jeremy Hammond, who was Washington's top cyber criminal target when he was arrested in 2012.\n Sabu's willingness to turn over former colleagues to the government was, not surprisingly, panned by members of the hacking community:\nJeremy Hammond is serving a ten-year sentence for hacks that Sabu (working for the feds) told him to do.  When will the feds go to prison? -- Anonymous (@YourAnonNews)\nMay 27, 2014\nAn Anonymous representative told the Guardian that Sabu's cooperation with the government doesn't make him any less of a criminal, saying:\nMonsegur is, first and foremost, a criminal; the FBI's cyber crime task force are his co-conspirators.  While operating under their supervision, Monsegur committed numerous felonies which should in no way be excused due to his protected informant status...  The FBI continues to use captured informants, who commit egregious crimes in pursuit of reduced sentences, for the sole purpose of creating 'examples' to frighten the public.  They do this with the hope of pacifying online dissent and snuffing out journalistic investigations into the US government's misconduct.\n Sabu's crimes do, indeed, seem to warrant a more severe sentence than the seven months in prison and a year's supervised release doled out to him by the court.  Had Sabu, who helped found LulzSec and worked with Anonymous, not cooperated with the government, he could have served a prison sentence of up to 26 years.  And it's possible that Sabu had more of a mastermind status than the lenient punishment would imply, per the Guardian:\nWhat was not discussed during Monsegur's sentencing on Tuesday was that when he was convicted, Hammond claimed that Monsegur himself had directed much of his criminal activity, including attempts to break into the websites of foreign governments.\n On the other hand, according to the prosecution, Sabu faced a great deal of risk in agreeing to work with the government.  \"During the course of his cooperation, the threat to Monsegur and his family became severe enough that the FBI relocated Monsegur and certain of his family members.  Monsegur repeatedly was approached on the street and threatened or menaced about his cooperation once it became publicly known.\" \" Perhaps given his many enemies, he may not be any safer as a free man.",

Hector Xavier Monsegur has helped to prevent losses of millions of dollars, according to court documents filed by prosecutors.  Monsegur will be sentenced on Tuesday for his role in major online hacking attacks, but his aid will likely go a long way in getting him a reduced sentence.\n LulzSec was formed in May 2011 when Monsegur (AKA Sabu) and five other members of the Anonymous hacking movement joined forces.  According to the documents filed with the court, the group was responsible for major hacks into and thefts from servers belonging to companies including Fox Television, Nintendo and Sony.\n Monsegur was arrested in June 2011 and pled guilty, as part of a cooperation agreement with the US government, to nine counts related to computer hacking, amongst others.\n The documents filed in a New York court last week reveal that Monsegur's most substantial assistance came from his \"cooperation against significant cybercriminals\" affiliated with Anonymous, LulzSec and Internet Feds.  Prosecutors say his help allowed the FBI to identify, prosecute and convict the \"number one cybercriminal target in the world\" at the time - Jeremy Hammond.  He also helped prevent major hacking attacks that were being planned by active cybercriminals, according to the court documents.\n Prosecutors called Monsegur's help \"extraordinarily valuable and productive\" and have recommended that his sentence is limited to \"time served\".  He has already spent seven months in jail after breaking conditions of his bail in 2012.",

He was accused of participating in attacks against many high-profile organizations, including HBGary, Fox Television, the Tribune Company and the United States Senate.  By the time of his plea, he had been cooperating with the FBI for some time.  The agency has credited him with helping to prevent approximately 300 attacks against various targets, including NASA, and the information Monsegur provided helped lead to the arrest of other alleged hackers, including Ryan Cleary and Jeremy Hammond.\n Before the sentencing on Tuesday, prosecutors filed documents detailing Monsegur's crimes and his cooperation with the FBI on other investigations.",

Monsegur's cooperation also helped law enforcement agencies identify and arrest eight of Monsegur's co-conspirators in LulzSec and the Anonymous hacking group, Bharara said in a press release.\n Monsegur, sentenced Tuesday to time already served, also provided information on vulnerabilities, including at a U.S. water utility, that helped law enforcement to secure that infrastructure, Bharara said.  Bharara had asked for a lenient sentence for Monsegur because of his cooperation with authorities.\n Monsegur could have gotten a sentence of up to 26 years in prison.\n In pronouncing the sentence, Judge Loretta Preska of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York called Monsegur's cooperation \"truly extraordinary.\" \" Monsegur has served seven months in prison after pleading guilty in August 2011 to computer hacking conspiracy, computer hacking, computer hacking in furtherance of fraud, conspiracy to commit access device fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.\n Monsegur was a leading member of LulzSec, a splinter group from the Anonymous hacking collective, according to court documents.  Monsegur and other members of Anonymous took responsibility for several cyberattacks between December 2010 and June 2011, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the websites of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, as retaliation for the refusal of these companies to process donations to Wikileaks, according to Bharara's press release.\n In addition, between December 2010 and May 2011, Monsegur and other members of the Internet Feds computer hacking collective similarly waged a \"deliberate campaign of online destruction, intimidation, and criminality,\" the press release said.  Those attacks included breaking into computer systems, stealing confidential information, publicly disclosing stolen confidential information, hijacking victims' email and Twitter accounts, and defacing victims' Internet websites.\n The group hacked the website of Fine Gael, a political party in Ireland, and computer systems used by security firms HBGary and affiliate HBGary Federal, from which Internet Feds stole confidential data about 80,000 user accounts, the press release said.  Internet Feds also hacked computer systems used by Fox Broadcasting and stole confidential data relating to more than 70,000 potential contestants on the X-Factor television show.\n Monsegur and other hackers then formed LulzSec in May 2011.  The group hacked computer systems used by the Public Broadcasting System, in retaliation for what LulzSec perceived to be unfavorable news coverage; Sony Pictures Entertainment, from which LulzSec stole confidential data concerning approximately 100,000 users of Sony's website; and Bethesda Softworks, a video game company, from which LulzSec stole confidential information for approximately 200,000 users of Bethesda's website, according to court documents.",

Reuters\nThe New York man who helped US authorities infiltrate the shadowy world of computer hacking and disrupt at least 300 cyberattacks on targets that included the United States military, courts and private companies was given a greatly reduced sentence on Tuesday of time served, and was allowed to walk free.\n Federal prosecutors had sought leniency for the hacker, Hector Xavier Monsegur, citing what they called his \"extraordinary cooperation\" in helping the Federal Bureau of Investigation take down an aggressive group of hackers who were part of the collective Anonymous, of which he was a member, and its splinter groups, which had taken credit for attacking government and corporate websites.\n Mr. Monsegur's information, the authorities said, led to the arrest of eight \"major co-conspirators,\" including Jeremy Hammond, whom the F.B.I. had called its top \"cybercriminal target\" and who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in November.\n The judge, Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court, gave Mr. Monsegur time served; he had spent seven months in custody in 2012.\n The advisory federal sentencing guidelines had called for a sentence of roughly 21 to 26 years, although prosecutors had asked that he receive a substantially lower sentence, saying he had been \"an extremely valuable and productive cooperator,\" whose information was \"consistently reliable and complete, corroborated by documents and electronic files, as well as by statements from other witnesses.\" \"\nIn seeking leniency, the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said that Mr. Monsegur had begun cooperating immediately upon being confronted by the F.B.I. in 2011, and that he was vilified online by supporters of Anonymous and was repeatedly \"approached on the street and threatened or menaced about his cooperation once it became publicly known\" in 2012.\n There was such concern about the threats that the government relocated Mr. Monsegur and certain members of his family, prosecutors told Judge Preska in a memorandum filed last week.\n Mr. Monsegur, 30, who as a youth lived in the Jacob Riis housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, pleaded guilty in August 2011 to 12 counts of hacking conspiracy, identify theft and other charges.\n He had been released on bail, but his bail was revoked in May 2012 after he made \"unauthorized online postings,\" the government has said, without elaborating on what they were.\n He served seven months in prison and was again released on bail in December 18, 2012; he has remained free since then.",

The charges could have put Monsegur in prison for life and torn him from the two cousins for whom he was a father figure.\n \"From the moment agents knocked on his door, [Monsegur] put his family first,\" defense attorney Peggy Cross-Goldenberg said at the hearing.\n Prosecutors revealed Monsegur's cooperation in March 2012, shortly after announcing the indictment of five people he ultimately helped convict.\n Chicago-based activist Jeremy Hammond recently was handed down a decade-long sentence for his hacking spree, most famously wresting more than 5 million private emails from the private intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting, or Stratfor.  WikiLeaks later published those communications under the name \"Global Intelligence Files.\" \"\nThe four other Anonymous members - Ryan Ackroyd, Jake Davis, Darren Martyn and Donncha O'Cearrbhail - pleaded guilty to charges last year in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n The indictment linked the co-defendants to attacks on Sony, Fox and PBS; private intelligence firms Stratfor and HBGary; the U.S. Senate and international law-enforcement agencies in the United States and Ireland.\n Preska noted that it was \"very, very unusual\" for prosecutors to have publicized Monsegur's cooperation in their cases in a lengthy press release.\n In the wake of exposure, Monsegur's brother was assaulted, and a reporter visited his cousins' school, attorney Cross-Goldenberg said.\n Monsegur told the judge that he went through a \"lot of changes\" and \"came a long way\" since his arrest.\n \"I assure you I won't be in this court again,\" he said.  \"I'm not the same person you saw three years ago.\" \"\nHammond and his lawyers have long alleged that Monsegur goaded the attacks on Stratfor and various foreign government websites.\n In November, Preska interrupted Hammond's defiant prepared statement when he started to name the countries whose websites that he claimed Monsegur urged him to hack.\n Hammond's lawyer Sarah Kunstler told the New York Times on Saturday: \"The government's characterization of Sabu's role is false.  Far from protecting foreign governments, Sabu identified targets and actively facilitated the hacks of their computer systems.\" \"\nYourAnonNews, the social-networking arm of Anonymous, took to Twitter this morning to blast the sentencing.  \"Jeremy Hammond is serving a ten-year sentence for hacks that Sabu (working for the feds) told him to do,\" it wrote (parentheses in original).  \"When will the feds go to prison?\"\nAsked at a press conference about the allegations of Hammond's lawyers, defense co-counsel Philip Weinstein replied: \"I think he disclosed what he disclosed to the federal government.  They're satisfied with what he disclosed.  I mean, it's obviously a level of generalization due to security risks, but they're satisfied.  They have the background information.\" \"\nMonsegur will spend one year of supervised release and pay a mandatory $1,200 special assessment fee.",

Monsegur and other members of Anonymous, including Jeremy Hammond, took responsibility for a number of cyber attacks between December 2010 and June 2011, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the websites of Visa, MasterCard, and PayPa, as retaliation for the refusal of these companies to process donations to Wikileaks, as well as hacks or DDoS attacks on foreign government computer systems.\n Between December 2010 and May 2011, members of the Internet Feds computer hacking collective similarly waged a deliberate campaign of online destruction, intimidation, and criminality.  Members of Internet Feds engaged in a series of cyber attacks that included breaking into computer systems, stealing confidential information, publicly disclosing stolen confidential information, hijacking victims' e-mail and Twitter accounts, and defacing victims' Internet websites.  Specifically, Monsegur and other members of Internet Feds, including Ryan Ackroyd, a/k/a \"kayla,\" a/k/a \"lol,\" a/k/a \"lolspoon,\" Jake Davis, a/k/a \"topiary,\" a/k/a \"atopiary,\" Darren Martyn, a/k/a \"pwnsauce,\" a/k/a \"raepsauce,\" a/k/a \"networkkitten,\" and Donncha O'Cearrbhail, a/k/a \"palladium,\" conspired to commit computer hacks including the hack of the website of Fine Gael, a political party in Ireland; the hack of computer systems used by security firms HBGary Inc., and its affiliate HBGary Federal LLC, from which Internet Feds stole confidential data pertaining to 80,000 user accounts; and the hack of computer systems used by Fox Broadcasting Company, from which Internet Feds stole confidential data relating to more than 70,000 potential contestants on \"X-Factor,\" a Fox television show.\n In May 2011, following the publicity that they had generated as a result of their hacks, including those of Fine Gael and HBGary, Monsegur, along with Ackroyd, Davis, and Martyn, formed and became the principal members of a new hacking group called Lulz Security or LulzSec.  Like Internet Feds, LulzSec undertook a campaign of malicious cyber assaults on the websites and computer systems of business and governmental entities in the United States and throughout the world.  Specifically, Monsegur and his co-conspirators, as members of LulzSec, conspired to commit computer hacks including the hacks of computer systems used by the Public Broadcasting System, in retaliation for what LulzSec perceived to be unfavorable news coverage in an episode of the news program \"Frontline\"; Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony), in which LulzSec stole confidential data concerning approximately 100,000 users of Sony's website; and Bethesda Softworks (Bethesda), a video game company based in Maryland, in which LulzSec stole confidential information for approximately 200,000 users of Bethesda's website.\n Among other things, at law enforcement direction, Monsegur engaged in proactive cooperation that enabled the government to identify, locate, and arrest eight of his co-conspirators, including Hammond.  In addition, as a direct result of Monsegur's cooperation, the government was able to prevent or mitigate over 300 cyberattacks that were being planned or carried out by others, including on the computer servers of U.S. and foreign governments, international intergovernmental organizations, and private corporations.  Monsegur also provided information on vulnerabilities in certain critical infrastructure, including at a U.S. water utility, that enabled law enforcement to secure that infrastructure.\n In pronouncing the sentence, Judge Preska said Monsegur's cooperation was \"truly extraordinary.\" \" She also said, \"The fact that Monsegur immediately chose to cooperate and went back online...allowed the extraordinary cooperation.\" \"\nIn addition, at the proceeding, Judge Preska ordered Monsegur, 30, of New York City to pay a $1,200 special assessment fee.  Monsegur previously served seven months in prison in connection with the crimes to which he pleaded guilty.  5-27-14",

Prior to the official sentence, prosecutors were pushing for as little as seven months behind bars.\n Sabu walks! https://t.co/egK8RdY0WU\n\u00e2\u0080\" Daniel Stuckey (@danstuckey) May 27, 2014\nMonsegur \u00e2\u0080\" also known by the internet alias, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSabu\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\" first came to prominence with Anonymous in 2011, when he began leading LulzSec in a series of cyber operations whose targets included Fox television and PayPal.  After gloating online about his group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accomplishments, such as its ability to obtain private information, the FBI was able to track him down at his home.\n Judge Preska saluted Sabu's \"personal characteristic of turning on a dime\" before she handed out her sentence.  \u00e2\u0080\" Andrew Panda Blake (@apblake)\nMay 27, 2014\nAt this point, Sabu quickly decided to cooperate with the government against his fellow hackers, and the FBI claims he helped them put a stop to at least 300 different cyber operations, including some against Congress and agencies like NASA.\n As noted by Yahoo, court documents allege that Monsegur \"convinced LulzSec members to provide him digital evidence of the hacking activities\" and \"asked seemingly innocuous questions that ... could be used to pinpoint their exact locations and identities.\u00e2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSabu walks pic.t twitter.c com/VqzSjsRQLO\n\u00e2\u0080\" Kevin Collier (@KCollierWrites) May 27, 2014\nPerhaps the largest arrest made with Sabu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooperation was that of internet activist Jeremy Hammond, who pleaded guilty to hacking into the private servers of the intelligence company Stratfor and relaying its contents to WikiLeaks.  Hammond was sentenced to 10 years in prison last year, but made waves when he accused the FBI of using its mole in Anonymous to trick the group into attacking the websites of foreign nations the US considered to be adversaries.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese intrusions, all of which were suggested by Sabu while cooperating with the FBI, affected thousands of domain names and consisted largely of foreign government websites, including those of Turkey, Brazil, Iran,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hammond said to the court before being silenced by US District Court Judge Loretta Preska.\n Hammond was detained back in March 2012, as part of an international raid in which most of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information was supplied by Sabu.  The following August, he issued a statement claiming that in addition to helping the FBI bury Anonymous and LulzSec, Sabu was used by federal agents to encourage group members to conduct cyberattacks against foreign nations that the government itself could not target.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the United States could not accomplish legally, it used Sabu, and by extension, me and my co-defendants, to accomplish illegally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hammond wrote.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy was the United States using us to infiltrate the private networks of foreign governments?  What are they doing with the information we stole?  And will anyone in our government ever be held accountable for these crimes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAs RT reported previously, documents released online in the wake of Hammond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sentencing showed that with Sabu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help, the FBI was able to convince hackers to conduct attacks on websites in Brazil, Turkey, Syria, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Nigeria, Iran, Slovenia, Greece, Pakistan.\n Sabu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in these operations have caused a backlash against him in the hacktivist community.  Some individuals published his personal information online and harassed him to the point that the FBI relocated him and his family to a location that remains unknown.\n Following a recent New York Times piece on the FBI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement in these international cyberattacks, a leak consisting of comments by Hammond went into further detail regarding Sabu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooperation with the government before suggesting the hacker himself is not the most important subject in this case.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my case, the FBI used Sabu to infiltrate and monitor hundreds of public and private hacker chatrooms where he was able to gain influence within Anonymous by claiming responsibility for hacks carried out by others, bragging to the media with hyperbolic quotes, accusing others of being sellouts and snitches and encouraging hacks into government and corporate websites,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hammond reportedly wrote.",

(Credit: AP)\nLegendary hacker Hector Monsegur avoided further jail time on Tuesday and was lauded by a Manhattan federal judge for his \"extraordinary\" help to the government in the three years since he was charged with masterminding a cybercrime conspiracy.\" \"That personal characteristic of turning on a dime and choosing to do good instead of evil is the most important factor,\" said U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska, who credited Monsegur with helping thwart an attack on a major city's water supply system along with other feats.\n Monsegur, 30, was a central player in the hacking groups \"Anonymous\" and \"LulzSec,\" known for multiple intrusions into private and public computer systems.  Arrested in 2011, he quickly pleaded guilty to conspiracy, computer hacking, fraud and identity theft, and became a government informant.\n Defense lawyers said he was primarily motivated by a desire to keep his family together.  He had just become the foster parent to two cousins.  Prosecutors said he aided in identifying and prosecuting former collaborators, and in thwarting more than 300 attacks.\n \"The last three years I have gone through a lot of changes, learned a lot of lessons,\" Monsegur, a largely self-taught hacker from New York City known online as 'Sabu,' told the judge.  \"I assure you I will not be in this courtroom again.\" \"\nMonsegur was jailed for seven months in 2012 for making unauthorized postings while he was working as an informant.  That seven months \"time served\" was the only jail time imposed by Preska, who offered him a \"salute\" for turning over a new leaf.\n \"You obviously have a great skill,\" she said.  \"To employ that skill for good would be a great thing .  .  .  I look forward to reading about you deploying your great skills for good.\" \"\nMonsegur's cooperation with the government was made public shortly after it began, his defense lawyers said, in hopes that it would deter some hacking threats.  He has received multiple threats, and is keeping details of his current residence secret, they said.\n Lawyer Phil Weinstein said he is now looking for a job, but is also provided information in some as-yet unfilled cases that are likely to lead to new arrests and indictments.\n \"The help he provided has probably not come to an end,\" Weinstein said.",

Particip\u00f3 en 2011 en un ataque contra Sony en el que robaron masivamente datos de clientes, as\u00ed como otro contra Fox.\n De acuerdo con documentos publicados hoy por el gobierno de EU, en junio de 2011 agentes del FBI visitaron el departamento de Monsegur en la zona baja al este de Manhattan, donde lo confrontaron acerca de sus actividades y de inmediato acord\u00f3 convertirse en informante.\n Sabu acept\u00f3 declararse culpable, regres\u00f3 a su vivienda y a partir de ese momento comenz\u00f3 a trabajar para el FBI, a cuyos agentes dio informaci\u00f3n sobre al menos 300 ataques cibern\u00e9ticos contra instituciones y empresas como la agencia espacial estadounidense (NASA), Bank of America y PayPal.\n Gracias a su colaboraci\u00f3n, la agencia investig\u00f3 y captur\u00f3 a miembros de Internet Feds y LulzSec, entre ellos el cibercriminal m\u00e1s buscado por el FBI, Jeremy Hammond, quien cumple una condena de 10 a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan dijeron los fiscales en documentos presentados ante la Corte.\n \"Trabajando a veces literalmente d\u00eda y noche, bajo la direcci\u00f3n de la agencia, Monsegur involucraba a sus co-conspiradores en chats en l\u00ednea que fueron cruciales para confirmar sus identidades y su paraderos.  Durante algunas de las charlas en l\u00ednea, por instrucci\u00f3n de la agencia, Monsegur convenci\u00f3 a miembros de LulzSec de que le proporcionaran evidencia digital de las actividades de hacking que aseguraban haber perpetrado previamente, tales como registros de ciertos ataques criminales\", detallaron.\n El trabajo de Monsegur con el FBI se hizo p\u00fablico cuando fue arrestado en 2012 por publicar en internet contenidos no autorizados.\n Tras la noticia, miembros de Anonymous hackearon un sitio web de seguridad inform\u00e1tica y publicaron una carta para Sabu: \"Sabu nos delat\u00f3.  Como suele ocurrir, el FBI lo amenaz\u00f3 con quitarle a sus hijos.  Lo entendemos, pero nosotros tambi\u00e9n \u00e9ramos su familia (\u00bfrecuerdas que te gustaba decirlo?).

Esta es la historia de uno cambio radical... o de una traici\u00c3\u00b3n.\n Seg\u00c3\u00ban su prontuario, Monsegur comez\u00c3\u00b3 sus actividades como pirata inform\u00c3\u00a1tico en su apartamento de Manhattan, en la primera d\u00c3\u00a9cada de este siglo y luego decidi\u00c3\u00b3 unirse a Anonymous.\n En una entrevista que dio en 2011, el hacker dijo que su entrada en el grupo se debi\u00c3\u00b3 a su rechazo al arresto del fundador de WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.\n A comienzos de ese a\u00c3\u00b1o, Monsegur se uni\u00c3\u00b3 a otros miembros de Anonymous y form\u00c3\u00b3 LulzSec, una c\u00c3\u00a9lula de piratas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos.\n Seg\u00c3\u00ban la evidencia analizada por el tribunal en Estados Unidos que lo juzga, LulzSec fue responsable de \"ataques may\u00c3\u00basculos\" contra los servidores de megacompa\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00adas, incluyendo Fox Televisi\u00c3\u00b3n, Nintendo y Sony.\n Pero al ser detenido, Monsegur se declar\u00c3\u00b3 culpable de nueve cargos en su contra, como parte de un acuerdo de cooperaci\u00c3\u00b3n con el gobierno.\n Gracias a su ayuda, el FBI pudo identificar y atrapar al \"cibercriminal m\u00c3\u00a1s perseguido del mundo\", Jeremy Hammond, quien fue condenado el a\u00c3\u00b1o pasado a una pena de 10 a\u00c3\u00b1os en prisi\u00c3\u00b3n.\n Pero su cooperaci\u00c3\u00b3n no se limit\u00c3\u00b3 a Hammond, sino que revel\u00c3\u00b3 informaci\u00c3\u00b3n de Anonymous, LulzSec e Internet Feds, otro grupo de hackers.\n Gracias a seguir en contacto con miembros de estos grupos, y de recibir informaci\u00c3\u00b3n de futuros ataques a trav\u00c3\u00a9s de estos contactos, Monsegur comparti\u00c3\u00b3 informaci\u00c3\u00b3n vital con los federales.\n \"El FBI utiliz\u00c3\u00b3 esa informaci\u00c3\u00b3n, cuando fue posible, para prevenir o mitigar el da\u00c3\u00b1o que, de otra forma, habr\u00c3\u00ada ocurrido\", dicen los documentos de la fiscal\u00c3\u00ada.\n Y a\u00c3\u00b1aden: \"Aunque es dif\u00c3\u00adcil de cuantificar, es posible que las acciones de Monsegur hayan evitado p\u00c3\u00a9rdidas de millones de d\u00c3\u00b3lares a esas v\u00c3\u00adctimas\".\n El exl\u00c3\u00adder de LulzSec tambi\u00c3\u00a9n contribuy\u00c3\u00b3 a evitar ataques cibern\u00c3\u00a9ticos contra una planta de agua y la red el\u00c3\u00a9ctrica en EE.UU., y tambi\u00c3\u00a9n ayud\u00c3\u00b3 a evitar una violaci\u00c3\u00b3n de seguridad a los servidores de una compa\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00ada de energ\u00c3\u00ada extranjera.\n Su colaboraci\u00c3\u00b3n lo convirti\u00c3\u00b3 en un paria para el grupo Anonymous y -seg\u00c3\u00ban la fiscal\u00c3\u00ada- informaci\u00c3\u00b3n personal de Monsegur comenz\u00c3\u00b3 a filtrarse en internet.\n El acoso de Anonymous habr\u00c3\u00ada sido tan intenso que el FBI decidi\u00c3\u00b3 reubicarlo a \u00c3\u00a9l y a miembros de su familia.\n Lulzsec es una combinaci\u00c3\u00b3n entre la muy popular expresi\u00c3\u00b3n en internet \"lol\", que en ingl\u00c3\u00a9s significa re\u00c3\u00adrse en voz alta (laugh out loud).\n Cuatro de sus miembros fueron arrestados en Reino Unido, luego de la detenci\u00c3\u00b3n de Monsegur, y ya han sido condenados.\n Uno de los fiscales en el proceso brit\u00c3\u00a1nico, Sandip Patel, explic\u00c3\u00b3 que aunque Lulzsec naci\u00c3\u00b3 de Anonymous, carec\u00c3\u00ada de la agenda \"libertaria\" del grupo de origen y se enfoc\u00c3\u00b3 en re\u00c3\u00adrse de las fallas de seguridad de otros sistemas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos, \"solo porque pod\u00c3\u00adan hacerlo\".\n Las operaciones del grupo incluyeron el robo de correos electr\u00c3\u00b3nicos, detalles de tarjetas de cr\u00c3\u00a9dito y contrase\u00c3\u00b1as de sus objetivos.\n Tambi\u00c3\u00a9n interrumpieron el normal funcionamiento de los servidores de sus v\u00c3\u00adctimas con inundaciones de correos basura.\n Los cuatro piratas inform\u00c3\u00a1ticos brit\u00c3\u00a1nicos recibieron penas de prisi\u00c3\u00b3n que van desde los 32 meses efectivos a 20 meses en suspenso.",
