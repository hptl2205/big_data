Bama is the next town to Gwoza when coming to Maiduguri town.\n\nThe whole hall was silent except for the sound of rifles that came intermittently, followed by the occasional shout of Allahu Akbar (God is Great) from outside the windows of the long dimly lit hall.\n\nFrom time to time, a voice or two would draw the attention of the shooters that some of the shot persons were not dead yet, and a shooter would walk over to the identified body and fire his rifle again.\n\nThe shooting, which had started before the video recording, showed victims lying about, some still wriggling in their final throes of death. An impatient shooter would dispatch a bullet into a wriggling body if he felt it did not die quickly enough, and then move on.\n\nAt a point, a wounded victim in grey clothes who was hiding under the corpses of his fellow dead colleagues, was fished out, and two of the shooters fired at him before he finally slumped on top of other corpses.\n\nThe floor of the dormitory hall was so filled with corpses that the attackers could hardly move freely.\n\nSeven minutes into the video, one short and scraggy looking leader of the terrorists stepped forward to speak.\n\nEven though most of the background voices were Kanuri, the terrorist who did not give his name spoke in Hausa.\n\n\"We are indeed very happy that God, the most praised and most exalted, has brought us to the town of Bama.

Maybe they stationed these insurgents in order to ambush and stop any reinforcements coming from Maiduguri,\" the source said.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government and the military authorities to give order to clear the Alagarno village and its environs of insurgents\n\nAccording to him, the terrorists have made the village as their base and hideout.\n\nMeanwhile, Boko Haram has released a new video where clips show gunmen mowing down civilians lying face down in a school dormitory, and a leader saying they are being killed because they are \"infidels\" or non-believers.\n\nThere are so many corpses the gunmen have difficulty stepping to reach bodies still twitching with life. Most appear to be adult men.\n\n\"We have made sure the floor of this hall is turned red with blood, and this is how it is going to be in all future attacks and arrests of infidels,\" the group leader said in a message. \"From now, killing, slaughtering, destruction and bombing will be our religious duty anywhere we invade.\"\n\nThe video released to journalists late on Saturday comes two days after fleeing villagers reported that the extremists are rounding up elderly people and killing them in two schools in Gwoza.\n\nThe setting of the latest video appears to be a school; a long dormitory furnished with bunk beds which the leader says is in Bama, a town 60 kilometres (40 miles) north of Gwoza.\n\nStudents and schools are frequently targeted by Boko Haram.\n\nPreviously, the militants had told residents of villages and towns that they would kill only enemies and wanted people to live peacefully in the area they have dubbed an Islamic caliphate, a large swath along the country's north-eastern border with Cameroon that they have controlled for more than three months.\n\nIn the video, the leader noted that the prophet Mohammed advised prisoners should be held, not killed, but says \"we felt this is not the right time for us to keep prisoners; that is why we will continue to see that the grounds are crimsoned with the flowing blood of prisoners.\"\n\nHe said some of those killed may call themselves Muslims, but are considered infidels by Boko Haram, a Sunni Jihadi group that imposes strict Shariah law.\n\nThousands of people have been killed and about 1.6 million driven from their homes in the five-year insurgency that is spilling across borders into Cameroon, Chad and Niger.",

You are either a believer or an unbeliever. These people we have killed refused to believe and wanted to remain unbelievers, so we killed them,\" he noted.\n\nThe video, released to the media on Saturday, is said to have been filmed in November in Bama, northeast Nigeria, Dutch news agency BNO News explained. The release follows reports last week that elements of Boko Haram had been rounding up and killing elderly people in two schools in Gwoza, a town about 60 kilometers to the south of Bama. Bama is said to have been captured by the militants from government forces in early September. BNO News estimates at least 55 victims, possibly more, in the recently released propaganda footage.\n\nSchools are often targeted by the Sunni militant group, whose name is often literally translated as \"Western education is forbidden\". The jihadi group, which declared a caliphate in the areas of northeast Nigeria under its control earlier this year, imposes strict Shariah law.\n\nOver 10,000 people have been killed and over 1.5 million driven from their homes over the course of the insurgency, which has also spilled into neighboring countries in Central Africa.",

The group said the men were killed because they were not 'true Muslims' and refused to join the Boko Haram.\n\nThe 11-minute video shows the brutal slaughter inside a dormitory, with multiple gunmen firing repeatedly at men who are lying face down. The shaky and low quality of the video makes it hard to determine how many people were killed in the brutal attack, but at least 55 victims can be seen, possibly more.\n\nThe militants inside the dormitory randomly fire at the defenseless victims, some of whom are in bunk beds, and the gunmen have difficulty moving around as most of the floor is covered in victims. Most of the victims appear to be adult men, though at least one victim appears to be a teenager.\n\nAfter the slaughter ends, a young boy - estimated to be 16 or 17 years old - addresses the camera, saying that the prophet Mohammed had made a mistake by advising that prisoners should be held, not killed. \"We will kill until the land is red with blood and then we will decide whether we want to keep those still alive as prisoners,\" he said.\n\nFor now, however, the group said it is \"not the time\" to hold and feed prisoners. \"For now, wherever we go, we shall kill, slaughter and scatter. That is our job,\" the boy says while surrounded by other militants. \"Because of the covenant we have with Allah we can't live with unbelievers on the same land.\"\n\nThe boy continues by emphasizing that their victims are \"unbelievers\" and that while some may claim to be Muslims, the Boko Haram considers them to be 'infidels.' \"You are either Muslim or non-Muslim. You are either a believer or an unbeliever. These people we have killed refused to believe and wanted to remain unbelievers, so we killed them,\" he adds.\n\nThe Boko Haram, which declared a caliphate earlier this year in areas it controls in northeastern Nigeria, is seeking the imposition of an extremist stance of the Shariah law, which is a Muslim code of conduct. The group's name, in the local language of Hausa, roughly translates as 'Western religion is sacrilegious' or 'non-Islamic religion is a sin.'\n\n(Copyright 2014 by BNO News B.V. All rights reserved.

The officers were on special patrol doing crime reduction work in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.\n\n\"They were, quite simply, assassinated -- targeted for their uniform,\" said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who looked pale and shaken at a hospital news conference.\n\n---\n\nSony hacking case combines rare blend of international intrigue and Hollywood star power\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The hackers who hit Sony Pictures Entertainment days before Thanksgiving crippled the network, stole gigabytes of data and spilled into public view unreleased films and reams of private and sometimes embarrassing executive emails.\n\nOne month later, the Obama administration confirmed what many had suspected: The North Korean government was behind the punishing breach. U.S. officials are promising a response, unspecified so far.\n\nIt was an extraordinarily public reaction from the highest levels of American government, considering that far more vital domestic interests have taken hits from foreign hackers in recent years -- including the military, major banks and makers of nuclear and solar power whose trade secrets were siphoned off in a matter of mouse clicks.\n\nYet even in a digital era with an endless cycle of cyberattacks, none has drawn the public's attention like the Sony breach and its convergence of sensational plotlines:\n\nNorth Korea wants joint investigation with US over Sony hacking to prove it's not involved\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea proposed a joint investigation with the U.S. into the hacking attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, warning of \"serious\" consequences if Washington rejects a probe that it believes would prove Pyongyang had nothing to do with the cyberattack.\n\nThe proposal was seen by analysts as a typical ploy by the North to try to show that it is sincere, even though it knows the U.S. would never accept its offer for a joint investigation.\n\nU.S. officials blame North Korea for the hacking, citing the tools used in the Sony attack and previous hacks linked to the North, and have vowed to respond. The break-in resulted in the disclosure of tens of thousands of confidential Sony emails and business files, and escalated to threats of terror attacks against U.S. movie theaters that caused Sony to cancel the Christmas Day release of \"The Interview,\" a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nOn Saturday, an unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman in Pyongyang proposed the joint investigation with the U.S., saying the North knows how to prove it's not responsible for the hacking. He also said Washington was slandering Pyongyang by spreading unfounded rumors.\n\n\"The U.S. should bear in mind that it will face serious consequences in case it rejects our proposal for joint investigation and presses for what it called countermeasures while finding fault with\" North Korea, the spokesman said in a statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA.\n\n---\n\nYoung Cubans and Cuban-Americans contemplate a new future as governments establish ties\n\nHAVANA (AP) -- Daniela Martinez long figured that someday she would leave the struggles of daily life in Cuba and join her uncle in the United States, but after the events of the last few days, the 18-year-old medical student thinks exile may not be her only choice.\n\n\"He always tells me things are better there,\" Martinez said, gesturing with her chin toward the sea leading to Florida. Dangling her legs over the edge of the Malecon, the iconic concrete seawall where entertainment-starved young Havanans gather each evening, she said, \"I think things are going to get better.\"\n\nFor a generation that grew up believing the best way to pursue their dreams was to leave the island, the announcement this week that Cuba will open relations with the United States is prompting many to reevaluate their futures. At the same time, Cuban-Americans are considering what the changes will mean for their lives, with some even wondering whether they are significant enough to present a once far-fetched chance for them to return.\n\nThe five decades of estrangement since Fidel Castro came to power in the Cuban revolution have created an economic and psychological gulf much wider than the 90 miles of the Florida Straits. But the opening of relations, with increased travel and communication, stands to narrow those differences and create new opportunities, especially for young people less burdened by the past.\n\nFor Cubans like Martinez, it may mean that becoming a doctor won't limit her to a meager state salary. For others, there is the hope of Internet access and an end to the desperation that leads thousands to migrate each year. Cuban-Americans, meanwhile, see the possibility of starting businesses in their homeland, connecting with their roots and putting aside the bitterness of parents and grandparents who were arrested, exiled or had property seized in the revolution.\n\n---\n\n10 years on, tsunami-hit city is cleaned up but concerns linger over hazardous waste\n\nBANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- Cars. Fishing boats. Houses. Entire villages. The 2004 tsunami left Banda Aceh with mountains of debris up to 6 kilometers (4 miles) inland.\n\nDriving in the remade communities today, it's easy to wonder where it all went. Some of it is still there -- recycled into road materials, buildings and furniture. Some of it was burned, creating new environmental hazards. And most of it was simply washed out to sea.\n\nTen years after that gigantic wave engulfed this city of 4 million on the day after Christmas, Banda Aceh has been almost totally restored. The tangled mountains of rubbish are gone, and it's hard to imagine the destruction that once choked rivers, blocked streets and ripped up trees by the roots.\n\nThe endless heaps of twisted metal, splintered wood and broken concrete have all disappeared except for some scattered reminders for tourists and local residents. A drive along the coast highlights a stunning coastline with new houses perched near the beach. Lush mangroves have been planted to help withstand future tsunamis, fishermen are back at sea and farmers are again working their rice paddies.\n\nStill, authorities are concerned about the health and environmental risks posed by debris contaminated by oil, asbestos and medical waste sitting on the seafloor off the coast and in 32 unregulated dump sites around the city.\n\n---\n\nAmid media crackdown, Russia's only independent TV channel broadcasts from a living room\n\nMOSCOW (AP) -- Among the five TV journalists interviewing Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the odd one out was easy to spot. Mikhail Zygar's questions were sharper than those of the others, who headed back to spacious television studios while Zygar broadcast his piece from a Moscow living room.\n\nThe Dozhd news channel, whose editor-in-chief Zygar was given a Committee to Protect Journalists award last month, rose to prominence in 2011 with its coverage of the mass protests against President Vladimir Putin -- which state-owned television largely ignored.\n\nAs other Russian television channels have grown increasingly subservient this year, providing propaganda backing for the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and Russia's aggressive policy toward Ukraine, Dozhd didn't follow the lead -- and is now paying for it.\n\nPutin's government has been careful not to order the channel to shut down, but a Kremlin-instigated smear campaign has driven this rare independent broadcaster to the brink of demise.\n\nPast strollers and bicycles in the hall, a Soviet-era apartment in central Moscow now houses the studio of Dozhd, whose combined online and TV audience is about 12 million. Anchorman Pavel Lobkov sits on a chair in what was once a spacious living room.\n\n---\n\nAustralian woman charged with murder of 8 children whose bodies were found inside her home\n\nSYDNEY (AP) -- An Australian woman was charged with murder on Sunday in the deaths of seven of her children and her niece, whose bodies were found inside her home, police said.\n\nMersane Warria, 37, was charged with eight counts of murder in a bedside hearing at a hospital in the northern city of Cairns where she is recovering from stab wounds, Queensland state police said.\n\nPolice were called to the home in the Cairns suburb of Manoora on Friday morning after receiving a report of a woman with serious injuries. When they got to the house, they found the bodies, along with Warria, who was suffering from stab wounds to the chest.\n\nPolice haven't said how the children died, but Queensland Police Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar said they're examining several knives in the home that may have been the weapon used to kill them. Suffocation was also a possible cause of death, he said.\n\n\"We are considering that and that's why it's taking a bit of time,\" he said. \"It could be a range of things, from suffocation to a thousand other things.\"\n\n---\n\nNigeria's Boko Haram extremists pose regional threat with cross-border attacks and recruitment\n\nMAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) -- Thousands of members of Nigeria's home-grown Islamic extremist Boko Haram group strike across the border in Cameroon, with coordinated attacks on border towns, a troop convoy and a major barracks.\n\nFarther north, Boko Haram employs recruits from Chad to enforce its control in northeastern Nigerian towns and cities.\n\nIn Niger, the government has declared a \"humanitarian crisis\" and appealed for international aid to help tens of thousands of Nigerian refugees driven from their homes by the insurgency.\n\nThese recent events show how neighboring countries are increasingly being drawn into Nigeria's Islamic uprising. Thousands of people have been killed in Nigeria's 5-year insurgency and some 1.6 million people driven from their homes.\n\n\"We are concerned about the increasing regionalization of Boko Haram,\" said Comfort Ero, Africa director for the International Crisis Group. The countries have been slow to recognize \"the gravity and extent of the threat from Boko Haram.\"\n\n---\n\nHow President Obama spent Day 1 of his holiday vacation in Hawaii\n\nKAILUA, Hawaii (AP) -- How President Barack Obama spent the first day of his holiday vacation in Hawaii on Saturday:\n\n-- QUIET TIME AT HOME: Obama and the first family spent the morning at their vacation home in the breezy seaside town of Kailua and were greeted by sunny, blue skies. A handful of protesters stood outside the home's entrance holding signs that read \"Close Guantanamo Now!\" and \"No more drone killings.\" Bicyclists and joggers swooshed by taking little notice of the heavy security around the neighborhood. Obama's Hawaii vacations have become part of the holiday experience on Oahu.\n\n-- GOLFING: Obama headed out before noon to play golf at Marine Corps Base Hawaii on Kaneohe Bay, an emerald-hued bay flanked by jagged mountains just north of Kailua. A young boy in a baseball cap waved an American flag as the motorcade passed. On base the president was joined for golf by friends Mike Brush, Joe Paulsen and Bobby Titcomb, according to the White House Press Office.\n\n-- POLICE SHOOTING BRIEFING: The president was briefed on the shooting of two New York Police Department officers, and White House officials were monitoring the situation closely, the White House Press Office said. The officers had been ambushed in Brooklyn, New York by a gunman who said online that he was planning to shoot two \"pigs\" in retaliation for the police chokehold death of Eric Garner.\n\n-- EVENING AT HOME: Obama returned to the Kailua vacation home in the late afternoon. Protesters had left, and the only sign that remained was one that read \"Welcome Obama Ohana,\" using the Hawaiian word for family.\n\n---\n\nSpokesman: Muhammad Ali in hospital with 'mild' pneumonia; prognosis good, short stay expected\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Boxing great Muhammad Ali was hospitalized with a mild case of pneumonia that was caught early and should result in a short hospital stay, an Ali spokesman said Saturday night.\n\nThe three-time world heavyweight champion, who is battling Parkinson's disease, is being treated by his team of doctors and is in stable condition, said his spokesman, Bob Gunnell.\n\n\"He went into the hospital this morning,\" Gunnell said in a phone interview. \"He has a mild case of pneumonia and the prognosis is good.\"\n\nGunnell declined to say where the 72-year-old Ali is hospitalized. He indicated that Ali's bout of pneumonia was caught quickly.",

Estudiantes y escuelas son objetivos frecuentes de Boko Haram, cuyo nombre significa \"La educaci\u00f3n occidental es pecado\" en el idioma Hausa.\n\nATAQUE EN LA FRONTERA CON CAMER\u00daN\n\nMaiduguri, Nigeria.- Miles de miembros del movimiento isl\u00e1mico extremista de Nigeria Bojo Haram lanzaron ataques al otro lado de la frontera con Camer\u00fan, en incursiones coordinadas sobre aldeas fronterizas, un convoy de tropas y un campamento militar.\n\nM\u00e1s al norte, Boko Haram empleaba reclutas de Chad para reforzar su control de ciudades y pueblos del nordeste de Nigeria, cit\u00f3 AP.\n\nEn N\u00edger, el gobierno declar\u00f3 una \"crisis humanitaria'' y solicit\u00f3 ayuda internacional para ayudar a las decenas de miles de refugiados nigerianos, que llegan tras verse expulsados de sus casas por los insurgentes.\n\nEstos acontecimientos recientes demuestran c\u00f3mo los pa\u00edses vecinos se ven cada vez m\u00e1s afectados por la insurgencia islamista en Nigeria. Miles de personas han muerto en los 5 a\u00f1os de insurgencia islamista en Nigeria, y unos 1,6 millones de personas se han visto expulsados de sus casas.\n\n\"Nos preocupa la creciente regionalizaci\u00f3n de Boko Haram'', dijo Comfort Ero, directora para \u00c1frica del Grupo Internacional de Crisis. Los pa\u00edses han tardado en reconocer ''la gravedad y extensi\u00f3n de la amenaza de Boko Haram''.\n\nEro advirti\u00f3 de que la cooperaci\u00f3n entre los pa\u00edses vecinos es fr\u00e1gil. \"Ninguna de las partes est\u00e1 dispuesta a compartir informaci\u00f3n con las otras'', dijo. \"Siempre hay una falta de confianza en t\u00e9rminos de seguridad regional compartida''.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la experta se\u00f1al\u00f3 que existe recelo sobre la capacidad del otrora poderoso ej\u00e9rcito nigeriano, que se ha visto muy golpeado por Boko Haram. Un tribunal militar sentenci\u00f3 esta semana a 54 soldados a muerte por fusilamiento despu\u00e9s de negarse a combatir a los extremistas.\n\nChad respondi\u00f3 esta semana abriendo una \"c\u00e9lula antiterrorista'' regional contra Boko Haram en N'Djamena, la capital de Chad, a 40 millas (60 kil\u00f3metros) de la frontera con Nigeria, seg\u00fan un asesor del ministro franc\u00e9s de Defensa, Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nLa amenaza de Boko Haram a los pa\u00edses vecinos se vio resaltada el mi\u00e9rcoles cuando unos 5.000 insurgentes lanzaron ataques simult\u00e1neos contra localidades fronterizas en Camer\u00fan, seg\u00fan el Ministerio camerun\u00e9s de Defensa. En los combates, los milicianos colocaron un explosivo improvisado en la carretera que luego estall\u00f3 al paso de un convoy militar. Adem\u00e1s, atacaron la zona principal de barracones de la zona en Amchide, seg\u00fan el comunicado del Ministerio.\n\nLas tropas camerunesas repelieron el ataque y mataron a 116 milicianos, perdiendo a un sargento y un teniente en el proceso. Adem\u00e1s, el Ministerio estim\u00f3 que los insurgentes deb\u00edan haber sufrido m\u00e1s bajas en el lado nigeriano de la frontera debidas al fuego de artiller\u00eda.\n\nHace tiempo que se ha identificado la presencia de combatientes de Chad, N\u00edger y Camer\u00fan entre las filas del grupo armado en Nigeria. Pero los residentes que huyen de Boko Haram informan ahora de que los reclutas de Chad est\u00e1n aplicando el control de Boko Haram sobre localidades del nordeste de Nigeria, en el estado de Borno.\n\nVarias personas que huyeron del pueblo de Gajigana, atacado hace una semana, dijeron que combatientes a los que llamaron \"mercenarios chadianos'' han asumido el mando de la mayor\u00eda de las comunidades locales, incluso estableciendo tribunales para dirimir disputas.\n\n\"Controlan cada movimiento, todo lo que hacemos, la clase de gente con la que te ves'', dijo Kalli Abdullahi, que escap\u00f3 de Maiduguri esta semana y habl\u00f3 con la Associated Press. Si un vecino rompe la estricta ley isl\u00e1mica de la Shar\u00eda, \"te atrapar\u00e1n y te matar\u00e1n para infundir miedo en la gente'', dijo.\n\nFuentes del gobierno nigeriano confirmaron que Boko Haram controla 12 de las 27 \u00e1reas de gobierno local en Borno, as\u00ed como algunas en los estados de Adamawa y Yobe. Adem\u00e1s, tienen campamentos desde hace tiempo en Chad, Camer\u00fan y N\u00edger, seg\u00fan los expertos.\n\nEl l\u00edder de Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, expresa desde hace tiempo sus ambiciones internacionales, diciendo que su grupo lucha para hacer de \"el mundo entero'' un estado isl\u00e1mico.\n\nEl analista Ely Karmon se\u00f1al\u00f3 en un informe para la Iniciativa de Investigaci\u00f3n de Terrorismo que Boko Haram es ''una amenaza inmediata e infecciosa''.",

La pesadilla vivida hace una semana en el remoto pueblo nigeriano de Gumskiri, resumida en esas pocas palabras por un familiar de varios testigos, lleva la inequ\u00edvoca firma de Boko Haram. Militantes del grupo fundamentalista isl\u00e1mico que tiene en jaque al Gobierno nigeriano desde hace seis a\u00f1os irrumpieron el domingo en esa localidad del noroeste del pa\u00eds, prendieron fuego a casas, tiendas y a un centro m\u00e9dico gubernamental, y, seg\u00fan el recuento final de los propios residentes, asesinaron a sangre fr\u00eda a 35 personas y secuestraron a 172 mujeres y ni\u00f1os. \"Mi hermana y sus siete hijos est\u00e1n entre los secuestrados. Nosotros corrimos a escondernos y tuvimos suerte, pero a otros no les fue tan bien\", relataba a Reuters Abu Musa, uno de los residentes.\n\nBoko Haram, una secta cuya denominaci\u00f3n significa en lenguas locales \"La educaci\u00f3n no isl\u00e1mica es pecado\", inici\u00f3 su campa\u00f1a violenta en el a\u00f1o 2009. El rastro de terror que ha ido dejando desde entonces es sobrecogedor: hombres decapitados y mutilados; sus mujeres, obligadas a convertirse en musulmanas y tomadas como esposas; masacres contra comunidades enteras; pueblos arrasados; atentados con centenares de muertos en grandes ciudades; bombas en iglesias, bases militares, comisar\u00edas de polic\u00eda y edificios gubernamentales; bombas tambi\u00e9n en mezquitas...\n\nSolo en 2014, y seg\u00fan informa la agencia Efe, el grupo ha matado a unas 3.000 personas, cifra a la que ninguna otra organizaci\u00f3n terrorista se acerca en \u00c1frica, y con la que solo podr\u00eda equipararse el grupo Estado Isl\u00e1mico (EI), que desde finales de junio ha ejecutado en Siria e Irak a unas 1.500 personas, seg\u00fan datos ofrecidos por el Observatorio Sirio de Derechos Humanos.\n\nHa sido tambi\u00e9n en este a\u00f1o, 2014, cuando, a ra\u00edz del secuestro de m\u00e1s de un centenar de ni\u00f1as de una escuela en Chibok, las actividades del grupo han alcanzado su mayor repercusi\u00f3n internacional, gracias a que diversos personajes famosos propiciaron en las redes sociales una movilizaci\u00f3n digital en favor de la liberaci\u00f3n de las menores.\n\nLa campa\u00f1a alcanz\u00f3 un \u00e9xito sin precedentes, pero se fue diluyendo con el paso de los meses, mientras la ayuda militar internacional, encabezada por EE UU, tampoco lograba localizar el paradero de las escolares. Y, entre tanto, Boko Haram ha seguido afianzando su control en el norte del pa\u00eds ante la incapacidad del Gobierno y el Ej\u00e9rcito nigerianos, a quienes muchos critican por no estar haciendo lo suficiente.\n\nJunto con el fracaso de las autoridades nigerianas, la otra clave es la poca eficacia de la insuficiente intervenci\u00f3n internacional. Por un lado, Nigeria no ocupa un puesto destacado en las prioridades reales de los gobiernos occidentales; por otro, estos gobiernos, especialmente el estadounidense, se ven atrapados en el dilema de que para poder frenar a Boko Haram haya que prestar ayuda y armas a unos militares cuyo historial en materia de derechos humanos es de todo menos ejemplar.\n\nLo cierto es que, una vez pasado el momento viral causado por el secuestro de las menores, Nigeria ha vuelto a sumirse en un olvido del que solo emerge, y de forma fugaz, cuando se produce un nuevo secuestro masivo, como el de esta semana, o cuando se comete un ataque especialmente mort\u00edfero, como el triple atentado del pasado mes noviembre contra la Mezquita Central de Kano, en el que murieron m\u00e1s de cien personas.\n\n1,5 millones de nigerianos han huido de sus casas en las zonas que controla Boko HaramLa crisis, sin embargo, es diaria para cientos de miles de personas desde hace a\u00f1os. Seg\u00fan cifras de Naciones Unidas, 1,5 millones de nigerianos han huido de sus casas en las zonas que controla Boko Haram. Y los que se han quedado solo tienen dos opciones: acatar el credo de los fan\u00e1ticos o vivir con el miedo constante de ser asesinados.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de una interminable serie de golpes militares, Nigeria tiene actualmente un gobierno elegido democr\u00e1ticamente (no exento de acusaciones de fraude), que se enfrenta al gran desaf\u00edo de mantener unido al pa\u00eds.\n\nLa recuperaci\u00f3n del poder civil en 1999 y una mayor apertura increment\u00f3 las demandas a menudo secesionistas y violentas de diversos grupos \u00e9tnicos y religiosos. Boko Haram, cuya agenda pasa por imponer un califato isl\u00e1mico m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de las fronteras establecidas, a la manera del EI en Siria e Irak, es, sin duda, el m\u00e1s sangriento.\n\nEstas son las claves de c\u00f3mo y por qu\u00e9 ha logrado enquistarse esta secta en el pa\u00eds m\u00e1s poblado de \u00c1frica.\n\nEl nombre de Boko Haram (en idioma hausa) ha sido traducido como \"La educaci\u00f3n no isl\u00e1mica es pecado\", pero tambi\u00e9n, en otras interpretaciones, como \"La pretenciosidad es anatema\", o \"La educaci\u00f3n occidental es pecado\". El grupo ha extendido su control por un amplio territorio en el norte de Nigeria, ganado al Ej\u00e9rcito nigeriano y que comprende los estados de Borno, Yobe y Adamawa.\n\nBoko Haram, cuyos miembros pertenecen al islam sunn\u00ed, lucha por imponer la ley isl\u00e1mica (sharia) que emana de una interpretaci\u00f3n radical y fundamentalista del Cor\u00e1n, y se ha declarado \"franquicia\" en \u00c1frica del grupo yihadista sirio-iraqu\u00ed Estado Isl\u00e1mico.\n\nUno de sus objetivos es el establecimiento de la sharia como norma vigente en los 36 estados del pa\u00eds, y no solo en el norte de mayor\u00eda musulmana, donde la sharia (rechazada en el sur, con una mayor proporcion de cristianos) ha sido tradicionalmente considerada como un c\u00f3digo de justicia informal, y es aceptada, en mayor o menor medida, por amplios sectores de la poblaci\u00f3n.\n\nBoko Haram es considerado una organizaci\u00f3n que apoya abiertamente el terrorismo contra la poblaci\u00f3n civil, y usa medios violentos y coactivos en la persecuci\u00f3n de sus objetivos pol\u00edtico-religiosos. En mayo de 2014 el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU incluy\u00f3 al grupo en su lista de organizaciones terroristas, algo que ya hab\u00eda hecho Estados Unidos en noviembre del a\u00f1o anterior.\n\nEl grupo fue fundado en 2002, en la localidad de Maiduguri, en el estado de Borno, por Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, militante y l\u00edder de Boko Haram hasta julio de 2009. En 2004 la sede fue trasladada a Kanamma, en el estado de Yobe, donde se constituy\u00f3 una central operativa denominada \"Afganist\u00e1n\", desde la que Boko Haram atac\u00f3 y atent\u00f3 contra las fuerzas policiales nigerianas.\n\nLa secta inici\u00f3 su campa\u00f1a m\u00e1s violenta en 2009, cuando su l\u00edder muri\u00f3 en un intento de fuga mientras se encontraba bajo custodia policialEn los primeros a\u00f1os, no obstante, el grupo se limit\u00f3, fundamentalmente, a ejercer una fuerte presi\u00f3n sobre las autoridades locales para que aplicasen la sharia. La secta inici\u00f3 su campa\u00f1a m\u00e1s violenta en 2009, cuando Mohamed Yusuf muri\u00f3 en un intento de fuga mientras se encontraba bajo custodia policial. Yusuf hab\u00eda sido capturado por el ej\u00e9rcito, y los militares lo entregaron a la polic\u00eda. Seg\u00fan diversas fuentes, su muerte al intentar escapar fue, en realidad, una ejecuci\u00f3n a sangre fr\u00eda.\n\nTras la muerte de Yusuf, el grupo pas\u00f3 a ser liderado por Abubakar Shekau.\n\nParece probado que miembros de Boko Haran han estado en contacto con Al Qaeda (en concreto, con la rama magreb\u00ed de esta organizaci\u00f3n), pero, a pesar de que el Gobierno nigeriano liga a ambos grupos, ni Estados Unidos ni expertos en yihadismo internacional han establecido de momento esa conexi\u00f3n, y siguen considerando al grupo nigeriano un problema de car\u00e1cter m\u00e1s local. La cercan\u00eda ideol\u00f3gica con el Estado Isl\u00e1mico, grupo escindido de la organizaci\u00f3n fundada por Osama Bin Laden, reforzar\u00eda la teor\u00eda de que no existe un v\u00ednculo formal entre ambos grupos.\n\nBoko Haram se financia a trav\u00e9s del pillaje, del robo de bancos, de la extorsi\u00f3n, de aportaciones de simpatizantes extranjeros y de los rescates por los secuestros.\n\nLas v\u00edctimas de las primeras bombas fueron principalmente los cristianos, pero pronto Boko Haram extendi\u00f3 sus acciones con secuestros y atentados indiscriminados contra toda la poblaci\u00f3n, incluidos los musulmanes.\n\nBoko Haram fue el responsable del atentado del 26 de agosto de 2011 contra la sede de la ONU en Abuya, que provoc\u00f3 24 muertos, y tambi\u00e9n de otro atentado perpetrado el 25 diciembre de ese mismo a\u00f1o en el que murieron al menos 44 personas, en cinco ataques contra templos cristianos en los que se celebraban los servicios religiosos de Navidad.\n\nEl 20 de enero de 2012 iniciaron una sangrienta campa\u00f1a de atentados en el estado de Kano, en respuesta a la negativa de las autoridades federales a liberar a algunos de sus miembros detenidos. Los ataques causaron al menos 250 muertos. El 21 de febrero de 2012 la secta provoc\u00f3 al menos 30 muertos en Maiduguri, al noreste del pa\u00eds, y el 8 de abril otras 38 personas perdieron la vida en un atentado junto a dos iglesias de Kaduna (norte), donde se celebraba el Domingo de Resurrecci\u00f3n, ataque que las autoridades atribuyeron a Boko Haram.\n\nEl 7 de agosto de ese a\u00f1o un nuevo atentado, que las autoridades volvieron a atribuir al grupo radical, dej\u00f3 19 muertos en una iglesia pentecostal en Okene, en el estado de Kogi. El 14 de abril de 2014 la secta volvi\u00f3 a golpear Nigeria con un ataque con bomba que caus\u00f3 varias explosiones en una de las principales estaciones de autobuses de Abuya, la capital, y mat\u00f3 a al menos 71 personas. El mismo grupo hab\u00eda causado el d\u00eda anterior al menos 98 muertos en ataques a tres localidades del norte en el estado de Borno.\n\nEl pasado 14 de abril los fundamentalistas capturaron a 129 ni\u00f1as en una escuela-residencia de la peque\u00f1a localidad de Chibok, en Borno, feudo espiritual de la secta. El secuestro, que se produjo tan solo unas horas despu\u00e9s del atentado en la estaci\u00f3n de autobuses de Abuya, alcanz\u00f3 una enorme difusi\u00f3n global gracias a las cuentas de Twitter y otras redes sociales de personajes famosos. Bajo la etiqueta \"BringBackOurGirls\" (\"Traed de vuelta a nuestras ni\u00f1as\"), en apenas unos d\u00edas los mensajes de denuncia y solidaridad con las v\u00edctimas se convirtieron en un fen\u00f3meno viral.\n\nEn abril los fundamentalistas capturaron a 129 ni\u00f1as en una escuela-residencia de la peque\u00f1a localidad de Chibok, en Borno, feudo espiritual de la sectaLa campa\u00f1a, sin embargo, perdi\u00f3 fuerza con el paso de los meses, y la ayuda militar internacional para encontrar a las secuestradas, que lider\u00f3 Estados Unidos, tampoco tuvo \u00e9xito. Un total de 44 escolares lograron escapar entre el 17 y el 19 de abril, y el 5 de mayo el l\u00edder del grupo, Abubakar Shekau, reivindic\u00f3 en un v\u00eddeo la autor\u00eda del secuestro.\n\nLas autoridades sospechan que las ni\u00f1as pueden haber sido violadas, despu\u00e9s de que una de ellas relatara que las rehenes m\u00e1s j\u00f3venes sufr\u00edan hasta \"15 violaciones al d\u00eda\" y que ella misma hab\u00eda sido entregada como esposa a uno de los l\u00edderes de la secta.\n\nEl 6 de mayo el secuestro de otras ocho ni\u00f1as volvi\u00f3 a conmocionar Nigeria; y solo tres d\u00edas despu\u00e9s el grupo asesin\u00f3 a 300 personas en la localidad nigeriana de Gamboru, que se sumaron a otras 150 asesinadas entre el 20 y 21 de mayo y otras 200 el 5 de junio.\n\nEl anuncio de una supuesta tregua entre el Ej\u00e9rcito nigeriano y los terroristas el pasado octubre devolvi\u00f3 a la actualidad la tragedia de las menores, aunque la esperanza de verlas liberadas dur\u00f3 poco. Dos semanas m\u00e1s tarde, Abubakar Shekau reaparec\u00eda en un v\u00eddeo para desmentir que existiera un acuerdo de alto el fuego con el Gobierno nigeriano y aseguraba que las menores ya hab\u00edan sido \"entregadas en matrimonio\".\n\nEl 24 de agosto, en Gwoza, estado de Borno, el grupo declar\u00f3 un \"califato\" como primer paso hacia su objetivo de implantar la ley y el Estado isl\u00e1micos en todo el pa\u00eds, y asesin\u00f3 a docenas de cristianos en la localidad de Madagali.\n\nLa proclamaci\u00f3n del \"califato\" tras la toma de Gwoza ha sido equiparada por algunos expertos a lo conseguido por el grupo Estado Isl\u00e1mico tras conquistar Mosul, en Irak. En este sentido, el analista camerun\u00e9s Martin Ewi, del think tank Instituto para el Estudio de la Seguridad (ISS), explica en El Pa\u00eds que, \"antes de conquistar Mosul, el EI no era una organizaci\u00f3n tan fuerte, como tampoco lo era el grupo nigeriano antes de autoproclamar su califato en Gwoza. Con la toma de Gwoza, Boko Haram se asegura recursos y un puerto desde donde planear con tiempo su siguiente paso\". \"Desde agosto, el grupo es m\u00e1s poderoso, tiene ambiciones que antes no ten\u00eda\", a\u00f1ade.\n\nEl 1 de septiembre el Ej\u00e9rcito nigeriano repeli\u00f3 un ataque de Boko Haram en Bama, tambi\u00e9n en Borno, con al menos 59 milicianos muertos, y el 12 de ese mes mat\u00f3 a m\u00e1s de cien militantes islamistas en Kodunga. En acciones armadas contra el vecino Camer\u00fan, el grupo ha perdido casi 150 activistas en dos choques ocurridos en la regi\u00f3n fronteriza de Fotokol.\n\nEn septiembre de 2014, Boko Haram controlaba ya trece localidades en los estados de Adamawa y Borno, y cerca de unos 20.000 kil\u00f3metros cuadrados.\n\nHasta el momento, el Gobierno nigeriano del presidente Goodluck Jonathan, que sigue manteniendo la existencia de negociaciones de paz, se ha mostrado totalmente incapaz de responder tanto al secuestro de las ni\u00f1as como al resto de las maniobras del grupo terrorista. Boko Haram centra sus ataques en una zona declarada en estado de emergencia desde 2012, pero electoralmente est\u00e9ril para el partido gubernamental.\n\nLa consolidaci\u00f3n de Boko Haram puede suponer un importante riesgo de contagio a pa\u00edses vecinos, como N\u00edger o Camer\u00fanEllo ha llevado a los grupos de la oposici\u00f3n a acusar a las autoridades de no tener inter\u00e9s en resolver una crisis que, en teor\u00eda, no parece determinate de cara a las pr\u00f3ximas elecciones, a las que Jonathan volver\u00e1 a presentarse como candidato. La incompetencia del Ej\u00e9rcito desplegado en la zona ser\u00eda la prueba. Seg\u00fan datos del centro de an\u00e1lisis Chatham House, citados tambi\u00e9n por El Pa\u00eds, de los 2.000 millones de d\u00f3lares (1.600 millones de euros) del presupuesto de las Fuerzas Armadas nigerianas, solo 100 millones se destinan al despliegue en el noreste.\n\nAlgunos analistas, sin embargo, consideran que el problema es m\u00e1s complejo, y que no se puede olvidar la dificultad que supone para los militares combatir en la zona del pa\u00eds que controla Boko Haram.\n\nEn cuanto al supuesto inter\u00e9s del Gobierno en no acabar con la crisis, el analista pol\u00edtico Nii Akuetteh, exdirector del grupo pro derechos humanos Africa Action, se\u00f1alaba al canal en ingl\u00e9s de Al Jazeera que \"se trata de una teor\u00eda conspiratoria sin sentido, porque, aunque no tenga mucha influencia electoral en el norte, el efecto de vencer a Boko Haram ser\u00eda muy positivo parea el presidente Jonathan en todo el pa\u00eds\".\n\nPara Akuetteh, la soluci\u00f3n pasa por un mayor compromiso internacional, y por poner la crisis nigeriana en un lugar prioritario, algo esencial, ya que Boko Haram tiene, al igual que el Estado Isl\u00e1mico, un car\u00e1cter transacional. Sus objetivos no se limitan a Nigeria, por lo que su consolidaci\u00f3n puede suponer un importante riesgo de contagio a pa\u00edses vecinos en \u00c1frica Occidental, como N\u00edger o Camer\u00fan.\n\nEl investigador y especialista en Boko Haram Aliyu Musa, por su parte, confiesa no entender la actitud del Gobierno nigeriano, ya que \"combatir a Boko Haram solo puede darle beneficios al presidente, incluso si la situaci\u00f3n se agrava y tiene que declarar un estado de guerra en el pa\u00eds, lo que le permitir\u00eda mantenerse en el poder sin necesidad de convocar elecciones\".\n\nEl ej\u00e9rcito, desmoralizado y que en muchos casos ha evitado los combates con los militantes de Boko Haram, no se enfrenta tan solo a problemas log\u00edsticos o de actitud. Los graves abusos perpetrados por los militares allanan a menudo el camino a Boko Haram a la hora de reclutar militantes en la zona, e impiden, al menos en teor\u00eda, que los pa\u00edses occidentales presten una mayor ayuda armament\u00edstica al Gobierno nigeriano.\n\nEl pasado mes de agosto, Amnist\u00eda Internacional public\u00f3 un detallado informe en el que denunciaba las \"atrocidades\" cometidas por el ej\u00e9rcito de Nigeria y por grupos afines al Gobierno en el marco de la lucha contra la milicia islamista. La ONG recab\u00f3 en el estado de Borno testimonios e im\u00e1genes que ponen de manifiesto ejecuciones extrajudiciales y otras violaciones de los derechos humanos que habr\u00edan sido cometidas en los \u00faltimos meses. Para Amnist\u00eda, los abusos registrados podr\u00edan ser constitutivos de cr\u00edmenes de guerra.\n\nEntre los casos denunciados figura un \"espantoso incidente\" cerca de la ciudad de Maiduguri ocurrido el pasado 14 de marzo. Amnist\u00eda Internacional localiz\u00f3 un v\u00eddeo en el que supuestos miembros del Ej\u00e9rcito y de la Fuerza Civil de Acci\u00f3n Conjunta (milicias afines al Gobierno) deg\u00fcellan a varios detenidos antes de arrojarlos a una fosa. Las im\u00e1genes, captadas al parecer el pasado 14 de marzo tras un ataque de Boko Haram, muestran a 16 hombres sentados en l\u00ednea que van siendo ejecutados \"uno por uno\".\n\nAmnist\u00eda internacional denunci\u00f3 que \"m\u00e1s de 600 personas\" fueron ejecutadas extrajudicialmente en varios lugares de Maiduguri despu\u00e9s de que Boko Haram asaltase una c\u00e1rcel y liberase a numerosos miembros de la secta islamista. La ONG expuso asimismo en su informe una serie de \"atrocidades\" cometidas en Bama, donde miembros del Ej\u00e9rcito y de la Fuerza Civil Conjunta juntaron a unos 300 hombres y les obligaron a desnudarse. A continuaci\u00f3n, los identificados como supuestos miembros de Boko Haram fueron obligados a tumbarse en el suelo y recibieron golpes de palos y machetes. \"Ten\u00e9is que pegarles, incluso matarlos. Son de Boko Haram\", dice uno de los militares presentes.\n\nLas soluciones meramente militares, por eficaces que puedan parecer\n\na corto plazo, dif\u00edcilmente resolver\u00e1n el problema de fondoComo ocurre en Siria e Irak, tanto en Nigeria como en otros pa\u00edses donde el yihadismo fundamentalista ha experimentado espectaculares avances en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, las soluciones meramente militares, por eficaces que puedan parecer a corto plazo, dif\u00edcilmente resolver\u00e1n el problema de fondo.\n\nEl fundamentalismo isl\u00e1mico, y Boko Haram no es una excepci\u00f3n, es un fen\u00f3meno muy complejo cuya expansi\u00f3n obedece a multitud de causas, desde la m\u00e1s obvia, es decir, la conquista de territorios por la fuerza y a trav\u00e9s del terror que impone su naturaleza extremadamente violenta, hasta otras m\u00e1s variables, como la dificultad de luchar contra un enemigo cuya organizaci\u00f3n y capacidad de renovaci\u00f3n en sus estructuras jer\u00e1rquicas desaf\u00edan constantemente las t\u00e1cticas de un ej\u00e9rcito convencional. La batalla, por m\u00e1s que el establecimiento de \"califatos\" haya cambiado en parte el escenario, sigue siendo m\u00e1s ideol\u00f3gica que territorial, y, por tanto, mas dif\u00edcil de combatir.\n\nEs posible, sin embargo, que ninguna de estas razones sea tan importante como el hecho de que estos grupos son capaces de ofrecer opciones, reales o no, a los elementos m\u00e1s desfavorecidos y desarraigados de poblaciones duramente golpeadas por la miseria y la opresi\u00f3n. La pobreza es, al final, la aut\u00e9ntica gasolina que nutre el motor del fundamentalismo.\n\nEn el tercer trimestre de 2013, el PIB de Nigeria creci\u00f3 un 6.8% anual, y el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) calcula que este a\u00f1o lo haga al 7.3%. Sin embargo, y seg\u00fan informa la CNN, el nivel de pobreza del pa\u00eds aument\u00f3 6 puntos porcentuales entre 2004 y 2010. Seis de cada 10 nigerianos viven con menos de un d\u00f3lar al d\u00eda, seg\u00fan cifras de la Oficina Nacional de Estad\u00edsticas.\n\nPor otra parte, y aunque Nigeria est\u00e1 dentro de las 30 mayores econom\u00edas del mundo, en el \u00cdndice de Desarrollo Humano ocupa el puesto 153 de un total de 207 pa\u00edses. La esperanza de vida es de 52 a\u00f1os y el nivel de escolaridad de s\u00f3lo 5,2 a\u00f1os. Y es precisamente en los estados donde se refugia Boko Haram donde la precariedad es m\u00e1s notoria. El desempleo en Borno y en Yobe, los territorios en los que m\u00e1s ha crecido la organizaci\u00f3n terrorista, supera el 26%.",
