                    "body": "There is too much smoke around this rumor for it to be entirely without merit. We first saw reports on Monday that Apple was working on something that would, to quote one of Business Insider's sources at Apple, \"give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nBy Friday, the Financial Times reported Apple had started hiring employees from the automotive industry for a secretive new research lab.\n\nOne of those hires includes Johann Jungwirth, formerly the president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development. This was further bolstered by a report on Friday from The Wall Street Journal, claiming that Apple has \"several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle.\"\n\nAccording to the Journal, the Apple car project was approved nearly a year ago by CEO Tim Cook. Steve Zadesky, a longtime Apple veteran and former Ford engineer, is reportedly leading.\n\nThen on Saturday, Reuters jumped into the fray to say that \"Apple is learning how to make a self-driving electric car and is talking to experts at carmakers and automotive suppliers.\"\n\nThese stories are all speculative, are all unconfirmed and could all ultimately lead to nothing. Still, as with past rumors about Apple's entry into tablet and wearables, there is simply too much reporting -- and from sources with too strong of a track-record -- to dismiss the idea of an Apple car out of hand.\n\nStill, my initial response to hearing that Apple was getting into the car game was to laugh. I mean, why would a computer company -- computers, large and small and phone-like, is all the company has ever made -- want to be in the automotive business?\n\nCars upgrade cycles are long. R&D investment is tremendous. Regulatory pressure is immense, production lines are complex and product liability issue are huge. The skill set involved in creating a great car is arguably very different than the skill sets involve in building a great computer, tablet or phone.\n\nSo why would Apple want in on the auto business? One possible answer is a glib one: Just because everyone else in Silicon Valley cares about it.\n\nFor years, Google has been investing in self-driving cars. Tesla, which has poached plenty of employees from Apple in the past (and has an Apple-like halo-effect around its brand and its user experience), is creating a widespread conversation around the technology of electric, battery-powered cars.\n\nYou wouldn't have been wrong to assume that CES 2015 was partially an auto show, thanks to myriad of companies showing off smart car systems, self-driving mechanisms, augmented reality displays and other connected car items.\n\nCompanies are starting to make big, long term bets on the \"next big thing.\" And for many companies, the future of automotive is the new hotness. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that Apple might agree with Google, Tesla and others that the car is a worthy moonshot project.\n\nElectric cars are appealing for other reasons, with the memory of massive spikes in fuel prices still fresh and with a growing global interest in climate change.\n\nFor many in the automotive industry -- as well as Google -- the next big technological frontier is cars that drive themselves.\n\nAs someone who hates to drive, this is a future I can firmly get behind. A self-driving, self-parking car that can drop me off at work or take me to the corner store while I sit back, check my email and play games? Sign-me up!\n\nHere, the early reports about the alleged Apple car are mixed. The Wall Street Journal says that self-driving cars are not part of the project, while the Reuters report directly contradicts that.\n\nOf course, nobody has any real inside information on the Apple car project. But if Apple is interested in a car it has to be at least experimenting with the mechanics of a self-driving car.\n\nNot only is that an interesting technological challenge to address, it would be in Apple's wheelhouse, especially when it comes to marrying hardware and software.\n\nWith all the excitement over the rumored project, it's important to throw cold water on expectations: You will not see an Apple car this year. Or next year.\n\nIf the Journal is correct, the Apple automotive project has been in the works for about a year and has less than 1,000 people on its team.\n\nThis means that the project is in nascent stages -- and that's assuming the goal is a car, not another embedded system for all cars.\n\nWe're not going to see an Apple car on the road in 2015. Or in 2016. Probably not even in 2017. This will not see the light of day for a very long time. Anyone putting off buying a new Volkswagen in lieu of the iCar should put those plans aside right now.\n\nA car play would be a longterm bet on, well, driving the future. It's not, as the Journal points out, an inexpensive industry to enter. Tesla spends $1.5 billion on R&D each year and still only manages to ship 35,000 cars. Apple has more than $100 billion in the bank.\n\nAs well capitalized as Apple is, however, money can't speed-up the research and development process, especially if self-driving cars are the goal.\n\nAll of the reports that have leaked thus far are confident that Apple is working on an automotive-based project, but are still smart enough to hedge against it.\n\nEach article includes a carefully-worded disclaimer: \"Apple has plenty of projects in the pipeline and in R&D that never hit the market\" and \"this could just be about trying to create a better, more integrated alternative to CarPlay.\"\n\nApple's interests in cars could be less about the vehicle itself and more about the software that controls the car. On its face, that would be a much more synergistic play.\n\nCupertino already has CarPlay, its partnership with a few dozen carmakers and aftermarket in-dash kits to bring better connectivity between your iPhone and your car's electronics system.\n\nBut CarPlay is still something of a hack.\n\nIn most automobiles, it is just a UI that sits on top of another embedded system (ironically, usually QNX, owned by BlackBerry). Most of the apps and experiences run off your phone and into the car itself.\n\nCarPlay, at least now, is not as advanced as Ford Sync, let alone the Linux-based dashboard Tesla has on its car. It's a nice way to bring your music, some apps and Apple Maps to the car (whether the average user would want Apple Maps over Google Maps in the car is another question), but it's hardly pushing the boundaries.\n\nCarPlay reminds me a bit of the Motorola Rokr. You remember the Rokr, right? It was the first \"iTunes Phone.\" Released in 2005, it was the first phone to work with iTunes. It was terrible and it was what reportedly convinced Steve Jobs that if Apple wanted to be involved in phones, it would have to make them itself.\n\nThe same could be true for a connected car ecosystem. Rather than building out CarPlay to sit atop existing systems, where it can't control the entire experience, maybe the plan is for Apple to build the software -- and potentially some of the internal hardware -- of the car itself.\n\nA car, electric or otherwise, equipped with Apple-designed internals and Apple software is something that could move the needle and push consumers into a car-buying decision.\n\nNobody thought Apple would ever be a player in the phone world, either.\n\nThe idea of an Apple car sounds insane on its face, but if this really is going to be one of the next big areas of technology's evolution, it would be equally insane for Apple to not be involved in some capacity.\n\nOver the next few weeks and months we'll undoubtedly hear plenty of additional rumors along with plenty of naysayers.\n\nRemember the years-long rumor binges related to iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV? We're in for another period of Apple rumors amok. This time, on four wheels.",

                    "body": "Early last week, a somewhat bizarre Apple rumor emerged from out of nowhere. Specifically, rumor has it that Apple is seriously investigating the prospect of developing its own branded automobile. The wave of rumors began a few days ago when Business Insider posted a report claiming that Apple was working on an exciting project that was luring back former employees from Tesla.\n\n... We got an unsolicited email from an employee at Apple about \"vehicle development\" at the company. This person said Tesla employees were \"jumping ship\" to work at Apple. \"Apple's latest project is too exciting to pass up,\" the person said. \"I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nInitially, it was easy to scoff at the report. Not only does the notion of Apple getting into the car business seem absurd on its face, but it's not as if Apple employees are exactly known for sending unsolicited emails about top secret research initiatives to tech publications. At most, the prevailing attitude was that Apple was simply keen on deepening their exploration into automotive-based software such as CarPlay. The very next day, Bryan Chaffin of Mac Observer chimed in with a report of his own. Citing sources presumably \"in-the-know\", Chaffin relayed that Apple has been hiring automotive engineers with the requisite expertise needed to develop and engineer full fledged vehicles.\n\nFrom another source who travels in more rarified circles than yours truly, I also learned that a lot of people at the top in Silicon Valley consider it a given that Apple is working on a car. This is circumstantial, at best, but if you're going to crowd-source wisdom, you could do a lot worse than polling the C-suite. I should add that when I asked one of my sources flat out to put a percentage chance on Apple working on an actual car -- rather than some kind of car-related technology -- I was told, \"80 percent.\"\n\nStill, at this point, the Apple car rumors were essentially more smoke than fire. Apple has an astonishingly massive R&D budget and who's to say just what they've been looking into. Remember, Apple explores products and files patents for inventions that never see the light of day. But a car? A car is different. A car is far beyond the realm of the traditional consumer electronic product Apple specializes in. Much more than delivering a new product category, a car would represent Apple entering into a completely new industry altogether. Which is to say, it was still hard to see any merit in the notion that Apple would be entering the auto industry of all things.\n\nBut this past Friday, the Apple/Car rumors became too numerous to ignore.\n\nFirst, the Financial Times reported that Apple recently poached Johann Jungwirth away from Mercedes-Benz where he served as president and CEO of the company's Research & Development arm. The Financial Times, which has a stellar record with respect to Apple rumors, added that Apple is shoring up a team already staffed with \"experienced managers from its iPhone unit\" and that the team is actively \"researching automotive products.\" Next, the venerable Wall Street Journal entered the fray with a report of their own. The Journal has a similarly impressive track record when it comes to Apple rumors and they echoed previous reports about Apple's car aspirations.\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named \"Titan,\" initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.\n\nThe reported size of the team certainly suggests that Apple is taking this research initiative quite seriously.\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone. Mr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nAdditionally, the Journal relayed that Apple executives have already flown abroad to \"meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars...\" Not to be outdone, the Apple/Car rumor bonanza continued over the weekend with Reuters, citing its own sources, reiterating that Apple is working on an electric and perhaps autonomous car.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based maker of phones, computers and, soon, watches is exploring how to make an entire vehicle, not just designing automotive software or individual components, the auto industry source said. \"They don't appear to want a lot of help from carmakers,\" said the source, who declined to be named. Apple is gathering advice on parts and production methods, focusing on electric and connected-car technologies, while studying the potential for automated driving, the source said.\n\nWithout question, the notion of an Apple branded automobile arguably represents the strangest and most outrageous Apple rumor we've seen in years, if ever. Having said that, even if we assume that the reports are true, getting a car from the design phase to market is a multi-year process, which is to say don't expect to see an Apple car on the road anytime soon.\n\nAs for the practical and logistical considerations which make an Apple branded car seem beyond the realm of reason, the rumor mill notwithstanding, we'll get into those in a subsequent post.",

                    "body": "Tech lovers saving up for an Apple Watch and a new iPhone just might want to start socking away a bit more cash, as a new report says that Apple is thinking about revolutionizing yet another industry. That's right: an Apple Car might be on the way in the coming years.\n\nApple's unending quest to get its minimalist logo on everything you have around you continues, as the Wall Street Journal said in a report on Friday that the tech giant is working on a massive new initiative aimed at producing an electric car. The move would bring Apple into competition with Tesla Motors, specifically, but also with the much larger automotive industry, which was expected to move 72.2 million vehicles worldwide in 2014.\n\nAccording to the new report, Apple has \"several hundred employees working secretly\" on the project. Initial designs for the Apple Car, code-named \"Titan,\" show a minivan-like vehicle, though Apple could well produce a wide range of vehicles if it does enter the automotive segment.\n\nApple already makes Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches, and an Apple Car might be on the way. Image via CashMacs.\n\nThe team behind Titan already numbers in the hundreds, and Apple product design vice president Steve Zadesky is reportedly heading it up. Zadesky was reportedly given permission to create a 1,000-person team to work on the project, and the executive has permission to bring in employees from all over Apple in order to work on it. The team is said to be looking into \"different types of robotics, metals, and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing.\"\n\nAlso pointing to the possibility that Apple is looking to produce an Apple Car is the fact that Apple last year brought on industrial design guru Marc Newson. Newson, a close friend of Apple design chief Jony Ive, has previously designed concept cars for Ford. Newson's Ford 012C concept has just the sort of minimalist aesthetic consumers have come to expect from Apple, though it is unlikely that any potential Apple Car would look exactly like what Newson produced in 1999.\n\nApple has reportedly met with executives for contract manufacturers that produce high-end cars like the Magna Steyr unit of Canada's Magna International. That move seems to indicate that Apple is not interested in maintaining its own auto manufacturing infrastructure, instead relying on outsourced labor to make an Apple Car, as Apple already does with its iPad, iPhone, and Mac line of computers.\n\nIs Apple working on producing its own electric car? Rumor has it that that's just what Apple is doing. Image via Marc Newson.\n\nThe WSJ report notes that it is often prohibitively expensive for new players to enter the auto industry, as the production of a manufacturing facility can cost well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain for the more than 10,000 components that go into making a car. For Apple, though, $1 billion is barely pocket change, as the tech giant already has more than $178 billion in cash as of December, 2014.\n\nAs with just about anything else that Apple hasn't officially announced yet, the rumored Apple Car isn't guaranteed to materialize until Apple CEO Tim Cook takes the stage and shows it off. This rumor, though, seems to have a bit more going for it than other Apple rumors.\n\nFor a while now, reports have circulated that a mysterious vehicle has been seen driving along roads in California. A check of the vehicle's license plate shows that it is registered to Apple, Inc., and the vehicle has a number of cameras on it, making observers believe that it might be either a self-driving vehicle or some sort of mapping vehicle.\n\nIf Apple is indeed looking at entering the automotive sector, it would be indicative of a larger push by the company to diversify its offerings. Apple just came off of the most profitable quarter in corporate history, selling a record amount of iPhones. Investors, though, want assurance that Apple isn't going to rest on its laurels. To that end, Apple is preparing to launch the Apple Watch in the coming months, and rumors continue to circulate that Apple is prepping an Apple-branded television. Now, it appears, tech observers can add an Apple-branded electric car to the list of things to drool over.\n\n[Lead image via Marc Newson]",

According to Colt's source, Apple's plans are a threat to Tesla itself:\n\nThis person said Tesla employees were \"jumping ship\" to work at Apple.\n\n\"Apple's latest project is too exciting to pass up,\" the person said. \"I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nFollowing this, Bryan Chaffin of The Mac Observer checked with his sources and was soon \"certain\" an Apple Car is in the works:\n\nI learned last week that Apple has been poaching employees from Tesla. I don't mean the kind of tit-for-tat headhunting that goes on between all Silicon Valley companies (now that the no-poaching agreements are out).\n\n[...]\n\nBut what I learned is that Apple has been looking for -- and acquiring -- the kind of people from Tesla with expertise that is most suited to cars. So much so that I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly.\n\nChaffin draws similarities between developing the iPhone and a car -- from Apple's lack of prior specific knowledge to the importance of software and bringing in the right talent -- to illustrate how a car could fit into Apple's plans.\n\nWell-connected Apple blogger John Gruber added his thoughts stating that he knows nothing of such a project and would \"bet against it\". He did, however, note how lucrative the car market is (particularly at the high end where Apple usually places itself) and many Apple staffers' penchant for cars.\n\nThe \uf8ff Car fire was later fueled by a Financial Times report that revealed Apple is recruiting experts in automotive technology and vehicle design to work at a new top-secret research lab, with the company having \"ambitions that go beyond the dashboard\".\n\nA couple of posts followed from CNET's Tim Stevens and Cult of Mac's Leander Kahney looking at the potential for Apple's automotive adventures. Stevens pointed at recent Apple hire of Johann Jungwirth, former President and CEO of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, as evidence of Apple's exploration of the smart car but argued that Apple's CarPlay software would be central to that. Kahney on the other hand highlights a number of car designers that now work within the walls of Apples's Industrial Design Group and looks ahead to the utility of Apple's new capacious research and development centers set to be constructed at its Campus 2 headquarters.\n\nAs if we hadn't heard enough about the Apple Car, The Wall Street Journal came out with a report stating that \"several hundred\" Apple employees are working on the electric vehicle, which currently resembles a minivan, dubbed \"Project Titan\":\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said.

There's certainly smoke and, as usual, it's unclear if there is any fire.\n\nPersonally, I don't think we'll see an Apple Car in our driveways any time soon. It's clearly an area Apple has an interest in -- be it from a software or hardware perspective -- but it's unclear if the automotive market is one Apple would want to enter itself. Jay Yarow at Business Insider tries to explain why Apple would want to make a car -- the industry being ripe for reinvention the key line of argument -- and, while many points raised are logical, I'm not sure anything I've seen so far has convinced me Apple is actually planning on making its own car (however much I might like to see it).\n\nHowever, electric cars are certainly the future, cars are becoming more like computers every year and Apple is clearly investigating the idea. Tim Cook and Co. know that, some day, Apple will have to branch out from consumer electronics and with the lines between the tech and automotive industries blurring, maybe that expansion could include a car. And if Cupertino is keeping its eyes on the industry, it's worth us paying attention too.",

Apple often tests ideas that don't get released, and the effort work may not lead to the company introducing an automobile, the person added.\n\nThe project is code-named Titan and the vehicle design resembles a minivan, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier Friday.\n\nSome Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers of high-end cars, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple already has technology that may lend itself to an electric car and expertise managing a vast supply chain.

                    "body": "Technology giant Apple is looking beyond mobile devices to learn how to make a self-driving electric car, and is talking to experts at carmakers and automotive suppliers, a senior auto industry source said.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based maker of phones, computers and, soon, watches was exploring how to make an entire vehicle, not just designing automotive software or individual components, the source said.\n\n\"They don't appear to want a lot of help from carmakers.\"\n\nApple was gathering advice on parts and production methods, focusing on electric and connected-car technologies, while studying the potential for automated driving, the source said.\n\n\"Fully automated driving is an evolution. Carmakers will slowly build the market for autonomous cars by first releasing connected and partially automated cars,\" the auto industry source said.\n\n\"Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\"\n\nWhether it would build and release an electric car or a more evolved autonomous vehicle remained to be seen, the source said.\n\nBut clearly Apple has sharply raised its ambitions in automotive technology, which has become a prime area of interest for Silicon Valley companies ranging from Google, which has built a prototype self-driving car, to electric-car firm Tesla Motors.\n\nAn Apple spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on \"rumours or speculation\".\n\nTrying to build an actual car would mark a dramatic shift for the maker of the iPhone and iPad. Apple often researches projects that are then discarded, and has so far mainly stuck to its core expertise in mobile and electronic devices.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Apple had set up a secret lab working on the creation of an Apple-branded electric car, citing people familiar with the matter. The lab was set up late last year, soon after Apple revealed its forthcoming smart watch and latest iPhones, the Financial Times said.\n\nThe Journal said that the Apple project, code-named \"Titan\", employed several hundred people working a few kilometres from Apple's headquarters.\n\nApple executives met with contract manufacturers including Magna Steyr in Austria, a unit of Magna International, the newspaper said.\n\nAlready, carmakers such as Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen's Audi have revealed cars that can travel long distances without human intervention.\n\nAnalysts at Exane BNP Paribas have said they saw a US$25 billion market for automated driving technology by 2020, with vehicle intelligence becoming \"the key differentiating factor\".

Carmakers will slowly build the market for autonomous cars by first releasing connected and partially automated cars,\" the auto industry source said. \"Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\"\n\nWhether it will build and release an electric car or a more evolved autonomous vehicle remains to be seen, the source said.\n\nBut clearly Apple has sharply raised its ambitions in automotive technology. Car technology has become a prime area of interest for Silicon Valley companies ranging from Google Inc , which has built a prototype self-driving car, to electric car-maker Tesla Motors Inc.\n\nAn Apple spokesman in London on Saturday declined to comment on \"rumours or speculation\".\n\nTrying to build an actual car would mark a dramatic shift for the maker of the iPhone and iPad. Apple often researches projects which are then discarded, but has so far mainly stuck to its core expertise in mobile and electronic devices.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Apple had set up a secret lab working on the creation of an Apple-branded electric car, citing people familiar with the matter. The lab was set up late last year, soon after Apple revealed its forthcoming smart watch and latest iPhones, the Financial Times said.\n\nThe Journal said that the Apple project, code-named \"Titan\", employed several hundred people working a few miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.\n\nApple executives met with contract manufacturers including Magna Steyr in Austria, a unit of Magna International, the Journal said. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nAutonomous driving is likely to emerge progressively as driver assistance systems become more sophisticated.\n\nAlready, carmakers such as Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen's Audi have revealed cars that can travel long distances without human intervention.\n\nAnalysts at Exane BNP Paribas have said they see a $25 billion market for automated driving technology by 2020, with vehicle intelligence becoming \"the key differentiating factor\". But the brokerage does not expect fully automated cars to hit the road until 2025 or 2030, in part due to regulatory hurdles.\n\nShort of building entire cars, there is money to be made from the software to run a self-driving vehicle, as well as the services associated with autonomous driving, such as mapping, car-sharing and car recharging services, the auto source said.\n\n\"It's a software game. It's all about autonomous driving,\" the industry source said.\n\nApple may be pursuing mainly auto industry expertise rather than full-scale partnerships with established car companies.\n\nWith its soon-to-be-launched Apple Watch, the company had held limited discussions with Swiss watchmakers, but no broad-based alliance emerged from the talks.\n\nInstead of partnerships, Apple pursued a go-it-alone strategy and turned to poaching talent from top watch brands.\n\nTwo different sources have told Reuters that Apple has tried to recruit auto industry experts in areas such as robotics.

It might be electric. It might be a minivan. Or it might be all three.\n\nWhile the Apple Car is little more than a rumor at this point, it would appear that the tech giant is serious about it. The company has recently gone on a hiring spree, acquiring automotive technology and design experts to research at a secret lab outside its Cupertino office.\n\nLast May, Apple announced CarPlay, its in-car entertainment system that connects to the iPhone.\n\nBut what is Apple's motivation to build the cars themselves?\n\nWell, it could be Apple's competitive streak. Its rival Google has been working on a driverless car for years, which is estimated to be be ready to launch between 2017 and 2020. In 2011, Apple revamped its iOS Maps application to compete with Google's popular mapping software.\n\nOr maybe Apple is trying to compete with Tesla. The electric carmaker just invested a huge amount of money in finishing its Model 3 family car, a move that Tesla CEO Elon Musk thinks will make the company worth more than Apple in the next decade. And the two companies are in the midst of a hiring war, each stealing hundreds of employees from the the other.\n\n\"Apple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone,\" said a person familiar with the company's work told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHowever, Apple is not alone in thinking that cars may be the next frontier for technology. Sony recently invested 2 percent into a Japanese startup that is building driverless cars.\n\nSo far Apple has declined to comment on the developing cars, but the Wall Street Journal article made the point that Apple frequently investigates technologies that it does not go on to sell. An electric car could fall into that category.",

                    "body": "By Daisuke Wakabayashi And Mike Ramsey\n\nApple Inc. has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named \"Titan,\" initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\n\nApple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, would be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.\n\nApple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won't ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.\n\nBut the size of the project team and some of the people assigned to it indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nOther Silicon Valley giants are looking at autos. Google Inc. has been working on a self-driving car for years. The head of Google's autonomous vehicle project said last year that the company aims to forge a partnership with auto makers to build a self-driving car within the next few years. A self-driving car is not part of Apple's current plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nBuilding cars are capital intensive, costing cost hundreds of millions of dollars for design, tools and production and certifications. Auto makers also must help ramp up a supply network for the thousands of components that go into a vehicle.\n\nBattery-powered cars add another dimension. Tesla Motors Inc., for instance, has seen losses widen amid rising expenses to build an electric sport-utility vehicle. It expects to spend $1.5 billion on capital expenditures and R&D in 2015.\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford Motor Co. engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nIn September, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple's campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and accompanying iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.\n\nManufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components. Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, said last fall that it is \"really hard\" to make a car, as the company struggled to ramp up production on its Model S sedan.\n\nThe expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27.\n\nTesla was able to ramp up its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former Toyota Motor Corp. factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.\n\nAuto makers tend to operate their own factories. For years, Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.\n\nApple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its Car Play service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle's dashboard information system.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several designers that have experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr. Newson created a concept car for Ford.\n\nApple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work. Even though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30% rise in revenue in the quarter ended December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Cook said at an investor conference that he does not believe that companies naturally to start to slow as their revenue grows. He said this was \"dogma\" and that Apple didn't believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.\n\nA side benefit of the project, according to one of the people, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavor without the pressure of churning new products every year.\n\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com and Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Apple, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tesla Motors, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US88160R1014",

The project is code-named 'Titan', and Apple's initial design resembles a minivan, the report says - not exactly a sexy choice for the iPhone maker.\n\nEarlier Friday, the Financial Times said experienced managers from Apple's iPhone division have been assigned to an automotive project at a secret Silicon Valley location. Apple has hired away the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley R&D lab, the FT says.\n\nBoth reports cite unnamed sources familiar with the plans, and Apple has declined to comment.\n\nIf Apple is building a car, it would take the company in a whole new direction and mark a bold gambit by CEO Tim Cook. Apple would also quickly run into one of its biggest rivals, Google, which is far along in its development of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nEven if things go smoothly and Apple decides to continue with its project, it will be several years, at best, before an iCar comes to market, the Journal says.\n\nAnd it's possible Apple is only exploring the area and has no firm plans to enter the market. Just toying with the idea could help Apple to develop new technologies that could be useful to its existing products, such as better batteries.\n\nBut the size of the team and the people assigned to it indicate that Apple is serious, sources told the Journal. Cook approved the project a year ago and put some top designers on it, the report says.\n\nTraditional automakers are also getting smarter about incorporating technology into their vehicles. Chevrolet's cars can come with built-in LTE connections, and in January Audi ferried journalists from Silicon Valley to Las Vegas in a self-driving car.\n\nThe idea of Apple as an automaker has met with skepticism. The Financial Times quoted a senior industry figure who doubted Apple would manufacture a car when it doesn't even make its tech products. That work is outsourced to manufacturing companies such as Foxconn.\n\nStill, given the engineering and design background of recent Apple hires, another FT source allowed that a car could be in the works.\n\nThus far, Apple's interest in the auto industry has been limited to CarPlay. That software allows components of iOS, including Siri and iTunes, to be controlled through a car dashboard. Volvo and Volkswagen have offered it in vehicles.\n\nApple could also team up with an automaker to bring a car to market. Google might pursue that course, too, as its vehicles get closer to release. Google has talked to Ford, General Motors and Toyota, among others, to decided whether to build the car itself or provide its software and technology to others.",

                    "body": "The rumor mill has shifted into high gear about Apple developing an electric car to take on Tesla and maybe even Google with a driverless vehicle. There are Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Financial Times articles that describe a project \"Titan\" having Apple taking on Tesla with hundreds of employees working on designing a minivan style vehicle. (Note that I own Apple shares).\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article says that Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, approved the car project about a year ago and put Vice President Steve Zadesky, a 16-year Apple veteran who led teams developing the original iPod and iPhone, to lead Apple's automotive research lab. It also talked about Apple hiring Johann Jungwirth (LinkedIn profile below), who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, back in September.\n\nSource: LinkedIn\n\nSince the Wall Street Journal is publishing enough tidbits about this I'll agree that there is credibility that Apple is working on something related to the automotive industry. Remember that Steve Jobs used to give Walt Mossberg when he was at the WSJ early previews of unannounced products. The key question is it a full-blown car of some kind or related to Apple's CarPlay, Maps app or something else to enhance the overall Apple ecosystem.\n\nLets look at this from a business perspective\n\nAs of September 2014 Apple had about 92,600 employees and 46,400 did not work in its stores. So having upwards to 1,000 people (what the WSJ says has been approved) or just over 2% working on a large project could be occurring but Apple is also known for having small teams. Maybe its currently only 100s so unless Apple is pretty far along with developing a car this number seems high.\n\nA picture of a car doesn't mean Apple is developing one\n\nNumerous publications including MacRumors have pictures of a reported Apple vehicle driving around the San Francisco Bay Area. What are all the devices on top of the car for? While I have not ever developed a car it seems strange that Apple would need this amount of equipment on top of a car to develop an electric car. It could be necessary for a driverless car or I'd wager (if I had to) that it is for the company's Map app.\n\nPage 1 / 4 Continue",

                    "body": "Apple has had a hell of a year - hitting records left, right, and centre. Now, rumours abound that the company is looking to get into the car manufacturing business, taking on the challenge of building an electric vehicle. But why would Apple, which has long specialised in technology you can can carry around in a bag, be interested in the car business?\n\nIf you thought it has been a while since you heard any more rumours about the long-awaited Apple TV, they are about to be replaced by even more exciting possibility that Apple may be about to build an electric car. The Wall Steet Journal kicked things off with a report that Apple had been hiring \"hundreds\" of staff with automotive design skills to work on a project called \"Titan\" that may be a self-driving electric vehicle configured in a (not-so-exciting) mini-van design.\n\nThere are several back-stories to this potential move by Apple. In one, we see continuing competition with rival Google, who has been working on a driverless car for some time and are saying that they will be launching a commercial version onto the market between 2017 and 2020. Google's motivation behind the self-driving car has been the development of the artificial intelligence software capable of pulling off this feat. Even if the car is not successful, the AI software will have a range of applications and possibility that would make the project still worthwhile. Increasingly, Apple has shown its willingness to develop its own capability in a range of competitive technologies that it can incorporate into products.\n\nIn another back-story, there is electric car company Tesla whose CEO, Elon Musk, has claimed that it will be as big financially, as Apple, within a decade. This will in part be based on the release of the Model 3, an affordable (US $35,000) family car with a range of 200 miles. Part of Tesla's strategy appears to include the poaching of numerous Apple staff. Although it seems that Apple has been reciprocating by offering Tesla staff large signing bonuses to move to Apple.\n\nAnd finally there is the view that electric cars, self-driving or otherwise, represent the future of transportation, especially a climate-friendly and sustainable one. At first sight, this may be a bit hard to believe when you consider that the top 3 selling vehicles in the US in 2014 were \"pickup trucks\". At the same time, hybrid electric vehicles represented less than 3% of all cars sold. Still, there is continuing interest by the car manufacturers in producing electric cars, if only as a hedge. GM has announced their new 200 mile range Chevy Bolt that will retail at around the same price as Tesla's Model 3.\n\nThere is little doubt that Apple could move into car manufacturing. With US $180 billion in cash, it could buy Fiat Chrysler, Tesla, General Motors and Ford outright.\n\nThere is also no doubt that with its ability to bring design and innovative computing to an industry employing technology that significantly lags that found in an iPhone. Apple and Google have both made moves to create in-vehicle media interfaces based on their systems. Apple's CarPlay will start to appear in cars this year. Customers who can't wait can buy after-market devices from Pioneer.\n\nApple's motivation to build an electric car may be driven by competition with Google, Tesla and others. It may be also finding a new business that doubles its value to $1.3 trillion as predicted by Carl Icahn. Alternatively however, it may be genuinely interested in building a technology that makes driving more sustainable and less dependent on oil. Apple is set to invest $3 billion in new solar farms in California and Arizona to provide energy for its operations there. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told investors:\n\n\"We know that climate change is real,\" Cook said on Tuesday. \"Our view is that the time for talk has passed, and the time for action is now. We've shown that with what we've done.\"\n\nWhether Apple's electric cars are aimed at combating climate change will depend on how they are manufactured and how the recharging infrastructure, which is still largely to be built in the US and globally, is run. Apple throwing its weight behind this infrastructure being built at all would certainly help making electric cars a more popular possibility.",

                    "body": "Two news reports Friday suggest Apple could be serious about buiding a car\n\nRumors that Apple is developing a car have been met with a world of skepticism, but two news reports Friday suggest there's something to the idea after all.\n\nSeveral hundred Apple employees are working in secret to develop an electric vehicle, The Wall Street Journal reports. The project is code-named \"Titan,\" and Apple's initial design resembles a minivan, the report says -- not exactly a sexy choice for the iPhone maker.\n\nEarlier Friday, the Financial Times said experienced managers from Apple's iPhone division have been assigned to an automotive project at a secret Silicon Valley location. Apple has hired away the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley R&D lab, the FT says.\n\nBoth reports cite unnamed sources familiar with the plans, and Apple has declined to comment.\n\nIf Apple is building a car, it would take the company in a whole new direction and mark a bold gambit by CEO Tim Cook. Apple would also quickly run into one of its biggest rivals, Google, which is far along in its development of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nEven if things go smoothly and Apple decides to continue with its project, it will be several years, at best, before an iCar comes to market, the Journal says.\n\nAnd it's possible Apple is only exploring the area and has no firm plans to enter the market. Just toying with the idea could help Apple to develop new technologies that could be useful to its existing products, such as better batteries.\n\nBut the size of the team and the people assigned to it indicate that Apple is serious, sources told the Journal. Cook approved the project a year ago and put some top designers on it, the report says.\n\nTraditional automakers are also getting smarter about incorporating technology into their vehicles. Chevrolet's cars can come with built-in LTE connections, and in January Audi ferried journalists from Silicon Valley to Las Vegas in a self-driving car.\n\nThe idea of Apple as an automaker has met with skepticism. The Financial Times quoted a senior industry figure who doubted Apple would manufacture a car when it doesn't even make its tech products. That work is outsourced to manufacturing companies such as Foxconn.\n\nStill, given the engineering and design background of recent Apple hires, another FT source allowed that a car could be in the works.\n\nThus far, Apple's interest in the auto industry has been limited to CarPlay. That software allows components of iOS, including Siri and iTunes, to be controlled through a car dashboard. Volvo and Volkswagen have offered it in vehicles.\n\nApple could also team up with an automaker to bring a car to market. Google might pursue that course, too, as its vehicles get closer to release. Google has talked to Ford, General Motors and Toyota, among others, to decided whether to build the car itself or provide its software and technology to others.\n\nFred O'Connor writes about IT careers and health IT for The IDG News Service.

                    "body": "By Daisuke Wakabayashi And Mike Ramsey\n\nApple Inc. has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named \"Titan,\" initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\n\nApple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, would be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.\n\nApple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won't ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.\n\nBut the size of the project team and some of the people assigned to it indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nOther Silicon Valley giants are looking at autos. Google Inc. has been working on a self-driving car for years. The head of Google's autonomous vehicle project said last year that the company aims to forge a partnership with auto makers to build a self-driving car within the next few years. A self-driving car is not part of Apple's current plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nBuilding cars are capital intensive, costing cost hundreds of millions of dollars for design, tools and production and certifications. Auto makers also must help ramp up a supply network for the thousands of components that go into a vehicle.\n\nBattery-powered cars add another dimension. Tesla Motors Inc., for instance, has seen losses widen amid rising expenses to build an electric sport-utility vehicle. It expects to spend $1.5 billion on capital expenditures and R&D in 2015.\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford Motor Co. engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nIn September, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple's campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and accompanying iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.\n\nManufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components. Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, said last fall that it is \"really hard\" to make a car, as the company struggled to ramp up production on its Model S sedan.\n\nThe expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27.\n\nTesla was able to ramp up its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former Toyota Motor Corp. factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.\n\nAuto makers tend to operate their own factories. For years, Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.\n\nApple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its Car Play service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle's dashboard information system.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several designers that have experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr. Newson created a concept car for Ford.\n\nApple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work. Even though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30% rise in revenue in the quarter ended December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Cook said at an investor conference that he does not believe that companies naturally to start to slow as their revenue grows. He said this was \"dogma\" and that Apple didn't believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.\n\nA side benefit of the project, according to one of the people, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavor without the pressure of churning new products every year.\n\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com and Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Apple, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tesla Motors, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US88160R1014\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-13-151918ET Copyright (c) 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n\nThis article appears in: News Headlines\n\nReferenced Stocks: AAPL , GOOGL , MGA , TSLA",

                    "body": "Apple's supposed interest in building a driverless car is gaining a lot of attention, from those in the tech world and outside the tech world.\n\nWhile the rumors could be just rumors, the fact that Google is developing autonomous vehicles gives the rumors a little more credibility. But would it be a good business idea for Apple?\n\nApple certainly has the cash to be able to hire personnel to develop and build cars. In fact, the reports indicate Apple is doing just that - hiring employees in the car industry, who are working in a secret lab away from the Apple headquarters in Cupertino.\n\nBuilding cars would be a huge undertaking for Apple, and would be completely unlike anything the company has ever done before. Upgrade cycles in the car market are far longer than in the computer and smartphone market. Not only that, but the research and development that goes into building a car is huge.\n\nThe Silicon Valley has begun seriously investing interest into the auto industry. As mentioned before, Google is building autonomous cars. Not only that, but Tesla has been reportedly poaching employees from Apple.\n\nApple has been developing an in-car entertainment system, CarPlay, for a while now, first showing off the system last year. Many companies are doing the same, offering their own in-car systems or features.\n\nThe rumors suggest Apple is looking at developing an electric car, which is appealing for a number of reasons. With gas prices only set to rise again and a growing interest in climate change, Apple being among the first to develop an affordable and fashionable electric car could be a big deal.\n\nIt's also highly likely that Apple is working on its own technology for autonomous cars, especially because Google is working on one. At the very least, if Apple is in fact working on a car, it will more than likely experiment with autonomous cars.\n\nThe rumors surrounding a car from Apple suggest the company has been working on the project for around a year and that it has a team of less than 100 people. Because of this, it's likely that if we ever see a car from Apple, it won't be for at least a few years. If it is ever released, however, it could change the auto industry, as well as change the definition of a tech company.",

                    "body": "Over the weekend, the internet experienced a super nova of hot takes on Apple's forthcoming car. Time told us what it \"could\" look like. Business Insider explained why Apple's car will be great for Tesla. Wired explained that it's not as ridiculous as you think, even though it's far from clear that you do think it's ridiculous.\n\nBetween the aggregation, the speculation, and the punditry, those who haven't been glued to the tech press for days may be confused. Here's a brief guide to what is known about Apple and the auto industry, and why it has so many people talking.\n\nPatient Zero for the Apple Car craze is a story released Friday evening by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Ramsey of the Wall Street Journal. They reported that Apple \"has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter.\" This was very quickly followed by a report from Tim Bradshaw and Andy Sharman of the Financial Times who say that Apple \"is recruiting experts in automotive technology and vehicle design to work at a new top-secret research lab, said several people familiar with the company.\"\n\nThe FT also slightly contradicted the Journal's reporting, saying that \"dozens\" of Apple employees (rather than hundreds) \"are researching automotive products at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside the company's Cupertino campus.\"\n\nReuters followed with a story from Edward Taylor and Alexei Oreskovic who reported that Apple is trying \"to learn how to make a self-driving electric car\" and sourced this information to \"a senior auto industry source familiar with the discussions.\"\n\nMaybe! But even though it would be fun to assume the answer is yes and start the speculation rolling, the reporting that's happened thus far really leaves it very unclear.\n\nFor starters, hundreds of people isn't nearly enough to start a car company. Tesla, a high-profile but distinctly niche automaker, has 10,000 workers. The Volkswagen Group has over half a million. A group of hundreds could be the foundation of what ultimately becomes a stylish, technology intensive automobile manufacturing operation but it's a long ways from getting there. Maybe it's a serious exploration that won't go anywhere.\n\nThe subsequent reporting from the FT and Reuters may feel like it's confirming the WSJ report about an electric car, but in many ways it's not.\n\nWhile hundreds is too few to run an auto production operation, it's certainly a lot of people. By contrast, the FT's team of \"dozens\" could easily be doing R&D on auto accessories rather than building a car. All the Reuters story really says, meanwhile, is that Apple executives talked to at least one senior auto company executive (probably from one of the German automakers, based on the Frankfurt/San Francisco byline) about self-driving cars.\n\nThat's intriguing, if true, but hardly definitive confirmation of anything.\n\nFord 021C concept car, designed by Marc Newson now at Apple (Ford)\n\nHere's how I'd be thinking about the landscape if I were the CEO of a cash-rich and highly profitable technology company with few products and some interest in the car industry. Right now, the automotive world is being unsettled by three trends that at the moment have not converged:\n\nBut these trends actually should work together seamlessly in the long run. Rather than owning cars, people will get around town in electric powered autonomous vehicles that they hail from their smartphones. A company with a boatload of money, engineering, software, and design expertise could underwrite a shoot-the-moon project to create the future of daily transportation.\n\nCombine all three technologies in one package and you have a game-changer. The low fuel costs of an EV plus the zero driver costs of an autonomous vehicle, could make ubiquitous taxis the dominant form of urban transportation in America. Apple could do all that and make the car look really cool. Why not?\n\nGoogle's Eric Schmitt with Transporation Secretary Anthony Foxx (Justin Sullivan/Getty)\n\nNot at all. There are some hazy indications that Google, which has invested a lot in autonomous cars without generating a commercial product, may launch a ride hailing service some day. Uber opened a research facility in Pittsburgh to play with autonomous cars, but has no product. Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, BMW, and others have all-electric cars and also some gestures in the direction of autonomy, but nothing like an electric car for hire service.\n\nNobody's done it, of course, because it's hard. But doing really hard combined hardware/software engineering tasks is exactly what Apple's good at. Making the world's first handheld multimedia player that was also a PDA and also a telephone was really hard too. From a journalist's viewpoint, it would be so exciting to see Apple put its amazing resources behind this kind of transformative project that it's easy to want to believe it's true.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be fairly out of character for Apple to undertake this kind of moonshot project. What's more, while Apple has what's now a long track record of making excellent devices, the company has struggled with network services -- the Apple Maps launch was deeply problematic, Siri made a poor initial impression on most users, many of the most forward-thinking iCloud features haven't worked reliably. Apple's never even had much success making an email service. A car is a gadget, but the elements of emerging car technology that are interesting to Silicon Valley -- autonomy and remote hailing -- are mostly on the network side of things.\n\nThere is some rigorous, fact-based material below I promise. For now, though, consider Elastica's \"Car Song\":\n\nThis innuendo-laden tune about a woman who appears to enjoy having sex in or on top of automobiles underscores the promise and the peril of the car market for a branding-heavy company like Apple. Cars are quintessential functional devices that people rely on to get to work. But they are also signifiers of coolness and other aspects of identity. On the one hand, the centrality of identity issues to the car industry makes it hard for newcomers to break in. On the other hand, Apple is really good at brand identity stuff.\n\nApple is actually in the middle of rolling out a not-at-all secret car initiative called CarPlay at the moment. The idea of CarPlay is that you will essentially dock your iPhone into your car, letting its processor and mobile data connection take over your car's display and other relevant functions. With a CarPlay car, you could use Siri and Apple Maps to verbally ask your car for directions or to find nearby restaurants. You could play music or make phone calls.\n\nThe basic capabilities of CarPlay are basically familiar to most people who own newish cars, which generally feature many of the same kinds of navigation functions (though without the promise of voice control). The issue is that cars are made by car companies, and car companies are not software companies. Therefore, the software and user interface elements of modern car systems tend to be a bit substandard.\n\nCarPlay lets car companies focus on building cars, while letting people who would rely on iPhones while on foot use the phone in the same way as a command center for the car's software elements.\n\nCarPlay has not yet set the consumer world on fire, largely because it's only available on a few models of new cars and most people aren't driving a brand new car. But reviews of it are pretty good and availability should increase over time. It's possible that many of Apple's car-related hires and discussions are about extending CarPlay's availability and services rather than any new Apple-branded car.\n\nThe blend of computers and cars has a pretty fundamental problem. Computer chips improve very rapidly, but people expect cars to last a long time. A car from 2005 may not be very flashy, but it should work fine and be something that a person is very comfortable owning. A cell phone from 2005, by contrast, is going to be laughably outdated today.\n\nSomething along the lines of CarPlay is a rather elegant solution to this problem. If the car's main computer element is in your smartphone then the silicon gets upgraded as frequently as you upgrade phones -- every one to three years for most people. Meanwhile, the engine and the seats and the steering wheel and all the rest can keep on plugging along forever.\n\nBy contrast, having a computer company start making cars just runs headlong into the problem. If the software features are going to be the key selling point, then the car is going to have an unusually short shelf-life. If the software features aren't going to be the key selling point, then what's the point in buying a car from a computer company?\n\nAnd of course making a car would be really difficult. Apple has shied away from doing things it pretty obviously could do -- making a television set, for example, or a smart thermostat -- on the grounds that it doesn't want to lose focus. A huge car initiative that might totally fail would be an enormous distraction from perfecting and expanding the company's current cash cow franchises.\n\nWe saw two big things in Apple's most recent earnings report. It's earning unprecedented profits and it's earning the vast bulk of that money from the iPhone. Due to the relentless nature of capitalism, Apple executives have to spend at least some of their time pondering how to expand. And we know that Apple is a very focused, very disciplined company. They're not going to build on their success by launching dozens of new products a year. So what can they do over the next decade that would be really big?\n\nTwo great things about the auto industry, from this perspective, are that car ownership is extremely common among the world's non-poor people and that cars are expensive enough that if people like your car you can sell it at a healthy profit margin.\n\nBesides smartphones, most of the things that are nearly ubiquitous (unlike, say, tablets) and high margin (unlike, say, staple foods) are broadly in the category of apparel. Everyone wears shoes, for example. Apple is clearly playing in the fashion world with its forthcoming Apple Watch. But beyond that, it's not clear where a technology company would go. Nobody has any reason to think people are looking to see computer chips integrated into their pants. Cars, by contrast, really are moving in a more computerized direction.\n\nThe Apple Watch was supposed to be released in \"early 2015\" which is now rumored to mean, roughly, April. A lot of scrutiny is going to be on that launch, and a lot of strategic thinking is going to have to go into whatever steps follow on the launch. Apple is also going to be launching a music streaming service sometime this year. And of course there is the usual cycle of phone, Mac, and iPad updates to attend to. Meanwhile, Apple representatives are working with carmakers to get CarPlay into more and more vehicles and strengthen the value of the company's golden iPhone franchise. This year's Consumer Electronics Show was full of buzz about CarPlay and Google's competing platform and it's very likely that whatever Apple is doing car-wise is focused on this.\n\nThat's plenty to chew on, regardless of whether Apple's car efforts are composed of dozens of people or hundreds. It is entirely possible that Apple will -- or is already -- putting serious money behind car R&D, but that executives will ultimately decide the project isn't leading to a product they want to sell.\n\nSteve Jobs once said that Apple's success comes from \"saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much.\" That's a big contrast to a company like Samsung that makes everything from smartphones to televisions to ocean-going ships. Or even to Google, which seems to be launching or acquiring a half dozen startups at a time. Exploring building a car and actually building a car are very different things.",

The \"Titan\" project initially was working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a mini-van, one of the people said. Apple declined to comment.\n\nApple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, could be useful to other Apple products.\n\nApple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won't ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.\n\nBut the size of the project team and the senior people involved indicated that the company was serious, the sources said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International. Magna declined to comment.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several people who have experience at European carmakers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr Newson created a concept car for Ford.\n\nApple hoped to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work.\n\nEven though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30 per cent rise in revenue in the quarter ended in December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.\n\nEarlier this week, chief executive Tim Cook said at an investor conference that he did not believe companies naturally started to slow as their revenue grew. This was \"dogma\" and Apple didn't believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.\n\nA side benefit of the project, according to one of the sources, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavour without the pressure of churning out new products every year.\n\nOther Silicon Valley giants are looking at cars. Google has been working on a self-driving car for years. A self-driving car was not part of Apple's plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.\n\nMr Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design vice-president Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the sources said\n\nMr Zadesky was given permission to create a 1000-member team.",

Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple has several hundred engineers currently working to deliver the company's first car. Now Reuters is reporting that Apple is talking to experts at automotive suppliers to help deliver its self-driven vehicle.\n\nRumours about Apple entering the car market have been circling for over a year - although the same could be said for televisions and Google Glass-style headsets, both of which have failed to come to fruition. However, the two independent reports from leading news sources suggest there's some meat on the bones of this particular rumour.\n\nThe Reuters report suggests Apple is looking to disrupt the car market in the same way it did the smartphone, delivering a unique product that's quite unlike anything on the market today. Reuters source said Apple wasn't seeking any help from existing car manufacturers. Instead, \"Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving,\" the source said.\n\nApple was last year linked with a possible takeover bid for electronic car maker, Tesla. The car maker's CEO, Elon Musk, was reported to have met Tim Cook for secret talks in 2013, however no deal has been forthcoming. Apple certainly isn't short of the funds required to buy Tesla, which is worth around $25 billion. Apple is sitting on a cash pile of $178 billion, having recently become the most profitable company ever. It could, frankly, buy almost any company it took a shine to.\n\nInstead, it seems Apple is going to spend its money on an internal engineering effort to develop the car. The Wall Street Journal said Cook signed off on the plans to develop the car more than a year ago, and that the company plans to \"give Tesla a run for its money\". Apple has reportedly lured several Tesla engineers with lucrative pay deals.\n\nApple certainly has some catching up to do if it does enter the self-driving car market. Aside from various initiatives from car manufacturers, Google has been developing its own autonomous vehicle for several years. Google's car has already undergone extensive live testing on roads in the US, although there's been no word yet of a full commercial launch.",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) might be about to release its first motor-vehicle. The concept of an Apple car will be an attractive one for many consumers, and it is a concept that makes sense for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, there has been something of a revolving door between Apple and the electric car manufacturer Tesla in recent years. And Apple has also been strongly linked with Tesla in other ways, with speculation rife during the 2014 that Apple was about to buyout the world's most successful electric car producer.\n\nSecondly, an electric car would seem to be exactly the sort of product niche that Apple would wish to be associated with. Apple has always attempted to brand itself as at the cutting edge of technology - which, of course, electric cars are - and it has also heavily played on its green credentials.\n\nIn The Simpsons, the environmentally-conscious Lisa Simpson falls for a company which is an extremely thinly disguised parody of Apple, and this was indicative of the extent to which the company has branded itself as sensitive to environmental issues. Whether this actually works out in reality is another matter entirely...\n\nAnd thirdly, Apple has already shown itself to be interested in the motoring market with the recent release of CarPlay. This music device intended for music players has been a major Apple release in recent months, and some analysts now apparently see this as a precursor to an eventual range of Apple electric cars.\n\nAnd there does seem to be a substantial chance of an Apple car appearing in the near future. The Mac Observer, always a close follower of Apple, has reported on a quotation by designer and writer John Gruber. Gruber suggests that a source intimate with Apple indicated that there was an 80 percent chance of an Applecart in the near future, and after doing a little digging Gruber himself concluded that in reality the chances of this occurring are virtually 100 percent.\n\nThis is a strong statement, and it is firstly worthwhile to consider the actual undertaking involved in developing and manufacturing electric cars. No-one should doubt for one second the credentials of Apple, and given some of its recent impressive sales figures and achievements in the stock exchange, there is no doubt that the company is in an outstanding position to take on ambitious projects should it choose to do so.\n\nBut manufacturing a car from scratch for the first time is far from an easy task, even for a corporation the size of Apple. Much though the consumer electronics giant is an extremely powerful force in manufacturing devices such as the iPhone, developing and producing a satisfactory motor vehicle is an entirely different prospect.\n\nIt must be borne in mind, for example, that Apple has absolutely none of the infrastructure in place that would be required to manufacture such a vehicle. Or at the very least, not the infrastructure to manufacture the mechanical parts. Other major auto manufacturers have already built up this infrastructure over decades of operating. Although Apple could possibly rely on its already powerful supply chain to produce electronic components, the scale of manufacturing required for a motor vehicle is on a different level to anything it has been involved with previously.\n\nThe next issue it would have to deal with would be one of perception. All Apple seemingly has to do with a consumer electronics device is put its badge on it somewhere, and it inevitably sells like hotcakes. The same cannot be said for a motor vehicle, where Apple has absolutely no reputation whatsoever, and would have to contend with a motoring press which is notoriously demanding and scathing.\n\nIt should also be borne in mind that this would be a massive departure from Apple's core (no pun intended...) strategy. Considering its high-tech image, Apple is actually not overly ambitious with new product lines. The corporation has always preferred to take a cautious approach to releasing new technology, and only inaugurates new niches into its portfolio of products when it is certain it has produced something of quality and stability.\n\nApple has been much more inclined to rely on what it knows rather than attempt to achieve outstanding quality in a field within which it is less comfortable. By attempting to produce a car, Apple would certainly be going well outside of its comfort zone.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper in the UK has already published a tongue-in-cheek article about the pitfalls of producing an Apple car. But much though this was not intended to be taken seriously, Apple itself will have to give serious regard to the logistical issues related to the project should it decide to dip its toes into the electric car pool.",

                    "body": "Apple Inc. has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.\n\nApple has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. They said the project, code-named \"Titan,\" has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of these people said.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\n\nAt best, it will be several years before an Apple car could hit the road, even if development goes smoothly and if Apple decides to proceed with the project.\n\nApple may decide not to proceed with building a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as a long-life battery and in-car electronics, would be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad. Apple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won't ever sell.\n\nBut the size of the team and some of the people assigned to it indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford Motor Co. engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nIn September, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple's campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and accompanying iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.\n\nManufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components. Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Motors Inc., said last fall that it is \"really hard\" to make a car, as the company struggled to ramp up production on its Model S sedan.\n\nThe expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27, 2014.\n\nTesla was able to ramp its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former Toyota Motor Corp. factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.\n\nAuto makers tend to operate their own factories. Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build all of its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.\n\nApple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its Car Play service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle's dashboard information system.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several designers that have work experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr. Newson has created a concept car for Ford.\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Magna International, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=CA5592224011\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Apple, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tesla Motors, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US88160R1014",

                    "body": "Apple set news wires alight at the suggestion of it developing an electric vehicle to rival the likes of Tesla and Google. The California-based tech firm has reported put 'a few hundred' employees to work on a secret project, which is tasked with developing an electric car. While Apple often tests ideas that don't get released, the work underscores the company's long-held desire to play a greater role in the automotive space.\n\nApple well placed to break into the automotive sector, due to the fact that connectivity is a key trend in the industry. With Apple's track record to developing highly intuitive connected devices, this could be a ripe opportunity for the company to develop a new arm of its business.\n\nFurthermore, with a market capitalization of more than $700 billion, Apple needs to continue growing sales of its iPhone - its largest revenue generator - while also expanding into new markets, such as automobiles, if it's to reach a $1 trillion valuation, says experts.\n\nSo it is clear then, that Apple has serious advantages compared with some of its Silicon Valley counterparts when it comes to breaking into the car market. But what are its strengths as a potential automaker? Manufacturing Global finds out.\n\n1. $178 billion cash\n\nThe automotive industry is cash hungry and Apple has almost $180 billion in the bank. While Apple lacks experience of building cars, money talks, meaning they could afford to poach top talent from other successful carmakers. Not to mention, the have the capital to develop new technology, which would appeal to consumers.\n\n2. The ultimate mobile device\n\nMany automakers are looking to integrate mobile devices into their cars. Apple is one step ahead in this regard, owing the world's most desirable hand held device, the iPhone. Apple has built its fortune on creating products that are aesthetically pleasing, user friendly and real-world applicable - it even has a range of car-ready tech from example mapping software, petrol station locators and more ready to go.\n\n3. Expertise in the sector\n\nBelieve it or not, Apple actually has a unique mix of executives with tech and auto experience. The company has long hired engineers from the automotive space, often with experience in supply chain management, battery technology and user-interface experience.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer spent 20 years at General Motors in areas of finance and operations. Eddy Cue, the influential senior vice president of Internet software, is a car enthusiast and on the board of Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vice president of iPhone product design, who is leading Apple's car effort, spent time working at Ford earlier in his career. Marc Newson, a well-regarded industrial designer who joined Apple's secretive design team last year, did a high-profile concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\nFurthermore, recent reports suggest Apple is also attracting top talent from companies such as Tesla, to strengthen its automotive pool of expertise.\n\n4. And extensive retail network\n\nApple already has a giant retail network, which spans the globe. Unlike many other technology providers, Apple opened its own showrooms and sold its products direct to the consumer - it would likely do the same with its vehicles, giving it's the pace and flexibility to keep up with demand.\n\n5. Apple knows how to operate in a global market\n\nThe automotive business has a global complexity like few other industries, with regulatory, marketing and logistics issues that can trip up the capital-intense business on any given day. Apple, which designs its products in California but depends upon contractors to assemble them mostly in Asia, is used to managing an on-time supply chain around the world and handling the complexities of currency swings throughout global markets. CEO Tim Cook built his reputation at Apple for his ability to navigate those global operations.\n\n6. Loyal fan-base\n\nFinally, Apple has one of the most loyal fan-bases in the world. Despite the high cost of its tech products, consumers buy into the 'Apple lifestyle' and will shell out the extra cash to own their devices. If Apple can emulate this success in the automotive field it's on to a winner.",

Earlier there were reports that Apple was prepping a Street View rival after some minivans leased to Apple, equipped LiDAR sensors and cameras, were spotted driving in Claycord, California. There were those who said that the vans were self-driving car prototypes.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal a number of top company executives are working on Titan and the report also pointed out that Cupertino has held talks with high-end car markers and that Apple is working with designer Marc Newsom, who has experience with car design.\n\nThe Journal even claims that Apple's decision of working on an electric car has motivated quite a few employees to stay at the company. There have been reports that Tesla has poached over 150 Apple employees in recent years and Apple's decision to start work on an electric car may have prevented many from jumping ship.\n\nDespite these reports, we are inclined to believe that an Apple Car might not be launched anytime soon considering that Apple, like other technology companies, is known to work on prototypes that never make it out as full-fledged products and that Apple Car is one of those.\n\nIt does make sense that Apple may be dwelling on an idea of releasing electric cars of its own as Tim Cook has already hinted at things that Apple is working on which no one is aware about.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" he said in September to interviewer Charlie Rose. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"",

                    "body": "If you thought it has been a while since you heard any more rumours about the long-awaited Apple TV, they are about to be replaced by even more exciting possibility that Apple may be about to build an electric car. The Wall Steet Journal kicked things off with a report that Apple had been hiring \"hundreds\" of staff with automotive design skills to work on a project called \"Titan\" that may be a self-driving electric vehicle configured in a (not-so-exciting) mini-van design.\n\nThere are several back-stories to this potential move by Apple. In one, we see continuing competition with rival Google, who has been working on a driverless car for some time and are saying that they will be launching a commercial version onto the market between 2017 and 2020. Google's motivation behind the self-driving car has been the development of the artificial intelligence software capable of pulling off this feat. Even if the car is not successful, the AI software will have a range of applications and possibility that would make the project still worthwhile. Increasingly, Apple has shown its willingness to develop its own capability in a range of competitive technologies that it can incorporate into products.\n\nIn another back-story, there is electric car company Tesla whose CEO, Elon Musk, has claimed that it will be as big financially, as Apple, within a decade. This will in part be based on the release of the Model 3, an affordable (US $35,000) family car with a range of 200 miles. Part of Tesla's strategy appears to include the poaching of numerous Apple staff. Although it seems that Apple has been reciprocating by offering Tesla staff large signing bonuses to move to Apple.\n\nAnd finally there is the view that electric cars, self-driving or otherwise, represent the future of transportation, especially a climate-friendly and sustainable one. At first sight, this may be a bit hard to believe when you consider that the top 3 selling vehicles in the US in 2014 were \"pickup trucks\". At the same time, hybrid electric vehicles represented less than 3% of all cars sold. Still, there is continuing interest by the car manufacturers in producing electric cars, if only as a hedge. GM has announced their new 200 mile range Chevy Bolt that will retail at around the same price as Tesla's Model 3.\n\nThere is little doubt that Apple could move into car manufacturing. With US $180 billion in cash, it could buy Fiat Chrysler, Tesla, General Motors and Ford outright.\n\nThere is also no doubt that with its ability to bring design and innovative computing to an industry employing technology that significantly lags that found in an iPhone. Apple and Google have both made moves to create in-vehicle media interfaces based on their systems. Apple's CarPlay will start to appear in cars this year. Customers who can't wait can buy after-market devices from Pioneer.\n\nApple's motivation to build an electric car may be driven by competition with Google, Tesla and others. It may be also finding a new business that doubles its value to $1.3 trillion as predicted by Carl Icahn. Alternatively however, it may be genuinely interested in building a technology that makes driving more sustainable and less dependent on oil. Apple is set to invest $3 billion in new solar farms in California and Arizona to provide energy for its operations there. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told investors:\n\n\"We know that climate change is real,\" Cook said on Tuesday. \"Our view is that the time for talk has passed, and the time for action is now. We've shown that with what we've done.\"\n\nWhether Apple's electric cars are aimed at combating climate change will depend on how they are manufactured and how the recharging infrastructure, which is still largely to be built in the US and globally, is run. Apple throwing its weight behind this infrastructure being built at all would certainly help making electric cars a more popular possibility.",

                    "body": "By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Ramsey\n\nApple Inc. has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.\n\nThe Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named \"Titan,\" initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\n\nApple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, could be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.\n\nApple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won't ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.\n\nBut the size of the project team and the senior people involved indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several people who have experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr. Newson created a concept car for Ford Motor Co.\n\nApple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work. Even though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30% rise in revenue in the quarter ended December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Cook said at an investor conference that he does not believe that companies naturally start to slow as their revenue grows. He said this was \"dogma\" and that Apple didn't believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.\n\nA side benefit of the project, according to one of the people, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavor without the pressure of churning new products every year.\n\nOther Silicon Valley giants are looking at autos. Google Inc. has been working on a self-driving car for years. The head of Google's autonomous vehicle project said last year that the company aims to forge a partnership with auto makers to build a self-driving car within the next few years. A self-driving car is not part of Apple's current plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Chief Executive Tim Cook told interviewer Charlie Rose in September. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nBuilding cars is capital intensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars for design, tools and production and certifications. Auto makers also must help ramp up a supply network for the thousands of components that go into a vehicle.\n\nBattery-powered cars add another dimension. Tesla Motors Inc., for instance, has seen losses widen amid rising expenses to build an electric sport-utility vehicle. It expects to spend $1.5 billion on capital expenditures and R&D this year.\n\nMr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nIn September, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple's campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.\n\nManufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components in a car. Elon Musk, chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, complained last fall that it is \"really hard\" to make a car amid the company's struggle to ramp up production of its Model S sedan.\n\nThe expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27, 2014.\n\nTesla was able to ramp up its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former Toyota Motor Corp. factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.\n\nAuto makers tend to operate their own factories. For years, Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.\n\nApple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its CarPlay service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle's dashboard information system.\n\nWrite to Daisuke Wakabayashi at Daisuke.Wakabayashi@wsj.com and Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Magna International, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=CA5592224011\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Apple, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US0378331005\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tesla Motors, Inc.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US88160R1014",

The tech giant has hired the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research and development unit, while Sir Jonathan Ive, senior vice-president of design at Apple, has held regular meetings with automotive executives and engineers. They have also directed many Apple employees led by managers from its iPhone unit to research automotive products. Some Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers of high-end cars.\n\nAccording to the reports, the project is code-named Titan and the vehicle design resembles a minivan.\n\nApple has already incorporated its software into cars. It may be hiring extra staff to shore up its CarPlay project, which lets drivers access contacts on their iPhones, make calls or listen to voice-mails without taking their hands off the steering wheel. However, its move to hire executive from other car companies has fueled rumors that it is looking to create an electric car of its own.\n\nThe source, who wished to remain unnamed, said, \"Fully automated driving is an evolution. Carmakers will slowly build the market for autonomous cars by first releasing connected and partially automated cars. Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\"\n\nApple has batted around the idea of developing a car for years. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, said in 2012 court testimony that executives discussed building a car even before it released the iPhone in 2007. Apple executives who worked with Steve Jobs also stated that the late co-founder of the company also wanted to develop electric cars.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has refused to comment on this news.",

And now, speculations have surfaced that technology giant Apple wants to join in.\n\nThe media and blogs were rife with speculation this weekend over the possible development of a new minivan-style electric car by Apple, taking on other industry majors like Tesla and Google in the process.\n\nCiting unnamed sources familiar to the matter, US business daily The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Friday said that several hundred Apple employees were secretly developing an electric vehicle resembling a minivan - the project code-named \"Titan.\"\n\nBut a self-driving car was not part of Apple's current plan, one of the sources told the WSJ.\n\nFurthermore, British business daily The Financial Times (FT) reported on Saturday that Apple was recruiting automative technology and vehicle design experts to work in a top-secret research lab located a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, California.\n\nApple Germany declined DW's request for an interview, stating in an email \"Apple doesn't comment on rumors or speculations.\"\n\nNew hires\n\nThe company's Chief Executive Tim Cook approved the car project a year ago and tapped Vice President of iPod and iPhone Design Steve Zadesky, a former engineer at Ford, to lead a 1,000-person team, according to the sources.\n\nThis team was now researching various types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the sources added.\n\nAnother fairly new hire is Johann Jungwirth, former head of Mercedes-Benz's research and development unit, who started with Apple last September as the new Director of Mac Systems Engineering, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nAround the same time, the company hired Marc Newson, an accomplished designer known for creating a concept car for Ford and also close friend of Apple's design chief Jony Ive.\n\nIndustry analysts, however, aren't entirely sure whether Apple's latest project will proceed to completion. The technology giant has been known to often research projects and then discard them.\n\nBut the size of the project team and the types of people involved in the project indicate Apple's dedication and seriousness to the endeavor, the WSJ said. The paper, along with the FT, reported Apple executives had flown to Austria on occasion to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars, such as Graz, Austria-based auto supplier Magna Steyr.\n\nMagna International based in Germany also declined DW's request for an interview.\n\nMoving beyond mobiles and music\n\nOne thing is clear though: Apple has had its eye on the automotive industry for awhile. The company unveiled Carplay last March, which allows drivers to access contacts on their iPhones, make calls and listen to voicemails without taking their hands off the steering wheel.\n\nBest known for its iconic iPods and iPhones, Apple has been credited with accelerating the digitalization of music, advancing its expertise in mobile and electronic devices for the past 15 years. In April the company plans to introduce Apple Watch, hoping to create a market for wearable devices.\n\nDevelopment and manufacture of a car is incredibly time-consuming and cost-intensive, with the price tag starting around $1 billion (877 million euros). But the expense barrier is expected to be less problematic for Apple, which became the first company to be valued over $700 billion on Tuesday after posting $18 billion in quarterly profits.\n\nA run for its money?\n\nA potential Apple e-car would directly compete with General Motors' future e-car, based on the Chevrolet Bolt, and Nissan's equivalent, the Leaf, which is already on the consumer market. Other Silicon Valley companies already in the business include electric automaker Tesla Motors and tech heavyweight Google, which is working on developing a self-driving electric vehicle.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last week it received an email from a person claiming to be an Apple employee, saying the company's latest project will \"give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nElectric car sales in Germany have fallen short of expectations, despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel's pledge to have 1 million battery electric vehicles on the country's roads by 2020.",

While any release would be years out still, due to the complexity of the project and plenty of safety certifications and other red tape, it appears that Apple has a lot of money and expertise wrapped up in the initiative.\n\nApple vice president Steve Zadesky, formerly of Ford, is leading the charge, while industrial designer Marc Newson - an ally of Jony Ive who Apple hired last year - has experience creating a concept car for Ford. Other employees have reportedly been snatched up from Tesla Motors and Mercedes-Benz, and Apple has been consulting with experienced automotive companies like Magna Steyr.\n\nHowever, the Journal report says that a self-driving car is not part of Apple's plan. That conflicts with the Reuters report that followed yesterday, which says that Apple is strongly researching driverless vehicles with the intent to develop its own complete vehicle.\n\nIt's entirely possible that Apple is simply building out an entire car for research purposes, and that we won't actually be cruising around in minimal Jony Ive-mobiles in a couple decades' time. Instead, Apple may simply be looking to design the software and intelligence to power other companies' self-driving vehicles, like an amped-up future version of CarPlay (pictured above).\n\nWhatever the case, whether the company plans to make a drivable electric car or a self-driving vehicle, and whether it wants to sell cars or just the brains behind them, it sounds like Apple is putting a serious chunk of its cash pile into seeing how it can shake up the future of transportation.",

The project has designed a vehicle that looks like a minivan, the newspaper quoted one person as saying. It would take years to finish the project, and it is not certain if Apple will eventually build a car, the Journal said. The news signals that Apple is sharply raising its ambitions for automotive technology, which has become a prime area of interest for Silicon Valley companies ranging from Google to ride-sharing firm Uber to electric car-maker Tesla Motors.\n\nThe connected car, or vehicles with a full range of internet and software services beyond mere navigation and communications, is considered one of the ripest areas for expansion for technology companies. Last March, Apple unveiled CarPlay, which lets drivers access contacts on their iPhones, make calls or listen to voicemails without taking their hands off the steering wheel.\n\nNow, the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research and development unit, Johann Jungwirth, has defected to Apple, according to a LinkedIn profile, which said his title was head of Mac Systems Engineering. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The Financial Times reported earlier that Apple had created the secret lab and that Jungwirth had joined the new research team. Two sources told Reuters that Apple has recently tried to recruit from the automotive industry in fields such as robotics. The research lab was set up late last year, soon after Apple revealed its forthcoming smart watch and latest iPhones, the Financial Times said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said that the Apple project, code-named 'Titan,' employed several hundred people working a few miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Apple executives have met with contract manufacturers including Magna Steyr, a unit of Magna International. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nGoogle is working on plans for a self-driving car, but that is not part of Apple's plan, the Journal said. Trying to design and build an actual car would mark a change for the iPhone maker, which researches and discards plenty of projects but has so far mainly stuck to its core expertise in mobile and electronic devices.\n\nBut it has been open about wanting to integrate its core iOS software into automobiles with CarPlay. Along with HomeKit and HealthKit, the idea is to extend Apple's software dominance into industries including home devices, healthcare, and automobiles.",

                    "body": "The craziest rumour doing the rounds at the moment isn't about the Samsung Galaxy S6 or the HTC One M9, but is centred on Apple. The biggest company in the world, the likes of Reuters is claiming, is working on building a self-driving, electric car.\n\nThat's right - a whole car. But are these rumours credible? Now, I don't have any super secret access to Apple, nor a crystal ball - but we can use what we know and the powers of reason to try to figure out if in a few years we'll be\n\nEveryone is STILL talking about it\n\nThere's no smoke without fire, as the old saying goes and despite the car rumours sounding insane, properly credible outlets like Reuters are now reporting the speculation, citing \"industry sources\", which is usually code for the journalist's mates who work at Apple. The fact that Reuters has a number of details - like the fact it is designing them in a building a few miles from its main headquarters, and when the unit was opened suggests there could be some concrete facts. Or a gigantic misunderstanding, of course.\n\nApple is known for going into markets and shaking shit up\n\nSince Apple's resurgence with the iPod, the company has built its vast fortune on going into existing sectors and doing something better than existing suppliers. Before the iPod, MP3 players were crap, lacked disk space and there wasn't a straightforward way to get music for your device (enter: iTunes). Phones were the same: Whilst smartphones did exist, they were fiddly and poorly thought out, and it took Apple's entry into the smartphone market to come up with a smartphone that was desirable and that actually worked well.\n\nThis is reminiscent of the car industry, which whilst steps towards electric cars and self-driving technology are slowly being made by the existing (dare we say \"legacy\"?) car makers, Apple could conceivably storm in with a car of its own, with production and design not weighed down by the weight of cars past: No thousands of older vehicles to continue to support, no difficult labour disputes with employees who have been working in the same way for years, and no risk of cannibalising sales of tried-and-tested petrol guzzling cars with something new.\n\nPerhaps Tesla could be to the Apple Car what the Palm Trio was to the iPhone?\n\nApple will want to keep pace with the likes of Google\n\nApple's biggest competitor is Google, and the two companies have gone toe-to-toe in a number of different product categories, ranging from phones, to web services to media boxes to... in-car computers. Would Apple really want to give Google the first mover advantage in self-driving cars? We already know Google is working on them.\n\nIt can probably afford to have a go\n\nLet's face it - Apple is loaded. It made $18bn profits in the last quarter alone, and if you're going to spend it on something, you may as well spend it on something fun rather than more boring Macs or making shareholders slightly happier.\n\nCars are REALLY expensive and involve a different production line and supply chain\n\nCars aren't much like phones - whereas the launch of the iPad or the Apple Watch involves getting the same companies in the supply chain to crank out more screens, processors and widgets, but cars have many more components and need a lot of stuff. Crucially there will be fewer synergies for Apple to leverage - meaning it will have to strike new deals and possibly even work with the older car makers that it implicitly is planning to destroy.\n\nAnd once you've built the cars... how do you sell them? Apple will need to negotiate with car dealers to and haulage firms and mechanics to get the cars to consumers. Which, even if they are receptive, will be a lot of hassle.\n\nAnd even if Apple can sort all of this stuff out, it is surely unlikely that Apple will be able to go big and wide right away. Forget shipping 60m iPhones in a quarter - getting a tiny amount of cars out there will be more difficult.\n\nCar life cycles are different to consumer gadgets\n\nHow often do you buy a new car? Not as often as you buy a new phone, I'd bet. If Apple makes a car, it i setting itself up for over a decade of support for each model. When it launches new features (like when the iPhone added a front-camera), they won't be ubiquitous after a couple of years, it'll take much longer. How many people are still driving cars that have a cassette player instead of an MP3 jack?\n\nIs self-driving technology really there yet?\n\nThis is the big unknown. There's been a lot of talk about the technology - with proponents even suggesting that self-driving tech is already better than you or me at the wheel, but this so far remains untested on a large scale. Whilst testing has just started on British roads, it can't be too comprehensive - and many different places will have radically different challenges. Will the Apple Car be able to self-drive on the snow-covered roads of northern Canada, the winding streets of Bristol and speed limit-free German autobahn? We simply don't know.\n\nWhilst electric might be an easier sell, if Apple launches a car it is only a matter of time until the first photos (perhaps taken on an iPhone) are shared showing an Apple Car is a car wreck - which could be a PR disaster.\n\nApple will have to solve the chicken & egg problem\n\nAs Tesla and other electric car makers know, there is a chicken and egg problem. People won't buy electric cars until there are enough places to charge up - but places won't install chargers until there are enough electric cars to use them. This means that even if you own a Tesla, there's only a limited number of places you can drive without running out of juice.\n\nApple is perhaps one of the best placed companies in the world to fix this. It could use its massive wealth to beat this problem, simply by paying up front for thousands of charging stations to be built. Whether it will want to make such a big financial gamble though remains to be seen.\n\nLegal hoops to jump through\n\nCars are necessarily highly regulated machines. Governments all have strict safety standards and testing requirements before a vehicle will be certified for road usage. Will Apple be prepared to do all of that? With the Apple Car, it almost certainly won't be one of those Apple keynotes where Tim Cook says \"...and its available RIGHT NOW!\" to huge applause. The timeline will be long.\n\nWill Apple be the coolest?\n\nSomething really interesting happened to the \"luxury\" phone market after the iPhone. No longer did rich people and celebrities want to be seen with, say, a Nokia Vertu phone, which was basically a normal phone covered in diamonds or gold. The hip new thing was to be seen with an Apple iPhone - the same iPhone that is used by scum like you or me.\n\nThe car market obviously has a big luxury component too. Will the same happen again? Or will Apple find itself going up against the likes Maserati or Ferrari and finding that, for the first time, the thing with the Apple badge isn't the coolest thing in the room? Apple's brand is all about presenting it as an elite product - and cars probably don't fit with this.\n\nSimilarly, when the Apple Car makes its Top Gear debut, it is unlikely to be the fastest car ever made, or have the biggest engine - the sorts of metrics that tedious car bores care about. Sure, it will have some neat gizmos, but it probably isn't going to be \"Ice Cool\" on the wall is it?\n\nCustomisation?\n\nThe other difference between cars and other consumer goods is that cars are highly customisable - with a myriad of options whenever you buy a car. Contrast to Apple and its philosophy of having a \"one (or maybe two) size fits all\" approach. If you want an iPhone, you have a choice of three colours and two sizes. If you want a Macbook, there's only three sizes and a couple of processor options. Philosophically, cars as we know them are more Samsung - with a billion variations - than they are Apple.\n\nWill the Apple Car make us give up our desire to customise?\n\nCars are falling out of fashion\n\nIt is becoming increasingly recognised that cars are no longer cool, with various studies showing interest in cars amongst millennials declining.\n\nWhether this is a reflection on tough economic times, or environmental concerns, or something else entirely it is clear that the car isn't in favour. Urban design is no longer about building bigger roads but prioritising public transport. Car use in urban centres like London is mercifully falling too - and bike use is growing. (Why can't we have an iBike instead?).\n\nMany commentators have speculated that the future of transport is shared. Nobody will bother owning a car when services like Uber are ubiquitous. And this is a good thing - as it means there can be less cars over all on the road, working around the clock rather than sitting idle.\n\nIf the death of the private car is increasingly inevitable, why would Apple want to launch a car? Unless it is planning something truly radical, like wholesaling the cars to the likes of Uber, cutting out consumers entirely?\n\nSo is Apple building a car? I'm not entirely convinced, but I don't think it is obvious nonsense... and hey, would such a radical move really be so surprising?",

The \"Titan\" project initially was working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a mini-van, one of the people said. Apple declined to comment.\n\nApple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, could be useful to other Apple products.\n\nApple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won't ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.\n\nBut the size of the project team and the senior people involved indicated that the company was serious, the sources said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International. Magna declined to comment.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several people who have experience at European carmakers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company's design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr Newson created a concept car for Ford.\n\nApple hoped to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work.\n\nEven though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30 per cent rise in revenue in the quarter ended in December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.\n\nEarlier this week, chief executive Tim Cook said at an investor conference that he did not believe companies naturally started to slow as their revenue grew. This was \"dogma\" and Apple didn't believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.\n\nA side benefit of the project, according to one of the sources, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavour without the pressure of churning out new products every year.\n\nOther Silicon Valley giants are looking at cars. Google has been working on a self-driving car for years. A self-driving car was not part of Apple's plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.\n\nMr Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design vice-president Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the sources said.\n\nMr Zadesky was given permission to create a 1000-member team.",

                    "body": "The the weird Apple rumor of the week is that Apple is getting into the car business. First, some articles pointed to some minivans with cameras that were registered to Apple and postulated that Apple was taking pictures to enhance Apple Maps. Others thought that this was perhaps a self-driving car, like what Google has been developing. Then sources started to report odd tensions between Apple and electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors and came up with the idea that Apple was developing an electric car.\n\nNow let's not forget that there are still far more reasonable rumors out there, like an Apple television, that haven't even come around yet. Chances are that an Apple car exists only in the imaginations of Apple bloggers looking for something to write about. It is far more likely that the vehicles in question are being used to test CarPlay, the iPhone Maps app or other things that need to be tested in real cars in the real world.\n\nBut lets have some fun and assume that Apple is really developing a car. Where does that take us?\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is: why? Why is Apple, a computer company, developing an automobile? That seems completely outside of their wheelhouse. The dashboard touchscreen for a car? Sure. More ways to connect the iPhone to cars? Sure. But a whole car?\n\nConsider that Apple invests a ton of money, people and time into research and development. Deep down in Apple's labs there are probably thousands of inventions and gadgets that Apple is working on, most that will never see the light of day. But they are all worth it for the bits and pieces (and patents) that do pay off.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the areas of research must have to do with batteries. Apple uses batteries in most of its products. They need them to be smaller, hold more power, charge faster and improve in ways that people aren't even thinking about. Better batteries means better products for Apple all around. Plus, if they can develop and patent a better battery, all of their products could jump very far ahead of the competition.\n\nI'm not talking about a small improvement. I'm not talking about an evolution. I'm talking about a true revolution in battery technology. Physics tells us that this is possible because of the enormous amount of energy that can theoretically be stored in a single atom.\n\nSo lets assume that the battery R&D group at Apple comes up with a revolutionary battery. It is a fraction of the size of today's best, charges instantly, and costs almost nothing.\n\nThey could turn around and put that into the next iPhone and leave Samsung in the dust. But the battery wouldn't just be used in phones and computers, it would be used anywhere mobile power is needed. And the biggest need for a battery like that would be in cars. I mean, phones are already small and portable. They would just be more so. But electric cars would suddenly be so much more sensible than gasoline-powered vehicles that the industry would change overnight.\n\nNow Apple doesn't develop technology and license it out. If they have a battery like this, they wouldn't think: Hey, we can sell this to Tesla and other car makers. That's not what Apple does. Being the richest company in the world, they can easily start their own car manufacturing branch and come out with their own car. And with the patent on a battery like this, they would be the only ones who could sell anything like it.\n\nAfter all, it isn't like the current crop of car manufacturers make vehicles that work flawlessly and last forever, right? And it isn't like there is any secret to how they make and sell cars. Why license patents for money when Apple can take over yet another industry?",

                    "body": "When it comes to rumors about Apple's future plans, sometimes it only takes a few days for a drop of speculation to turn into a flood of leaks. Earlier this month, Apple was linked to the appearance of nearly identical camera-equipped minivans in multiple locations across the U.S. While one analyst claimed that Apple's mysterious vehicles were part of an effort to develop a driverless car, other observers believed that the camera equipment indicated the minivans were simply Apple's answer to Google's Street View mapping cars.\n\nSince the Cupertino-based company does not publicly discuss its future product plans, the speculation about an Apple car appeared destined to fade away like so many other sketchy product rumors have in the past. However, that was not to be the case this time. A few days after the story broke about the camera-equipped minivans, Business Insider reported that it received an email from an unnamed Apple employee who claimed that the company was working on a \"vehicle development\" project that would \"give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nAlthough the employee's email referenced electric carmaker Tesla, it appeared to lack a direct claim that Apple was building a vehicle. So despite the breathless statement that Apple would \"give Tesla a run for its money,\" it was widely believed that the employee was most likely leaking details about a project related to CarPlay, Apple's in-vehicle device integration system. However, following Business Insider's report, The Mac Observer's Bryan Chaffin contacted its own insider sources who convinced him that Apple was building an actual car and not just a car-related product. And while Tesla has had more success poaching Apple's workers than vice versa, The Mac Observer's sources noted that the iPhone maker has hired some important auto experts away from Tesla.\n\nMore recently, reports from the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal have kicked the Apple car rumor mill into overdrive. According to the Financial Times' sources, Apple established a top-secret off campus research lab for its vehicle development project late last year. The sources claimed that chief Apple product designer Jony Ive and his team has been regularly meeting with auto industry executives and engineers. Apple has attempted to recruit automotive workers at some of these meetings, noted the sources.\n\nAccording to insider sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, one of those recruitment efforts led to the hiring of Johann Jungwirth, the former president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America. The Journal's sources claimed that Apple now has hundreds of employees working on the development of a minivan-like electric vehicle under the leadership of product design VP Steve Zadesky.\n\nZadesky - a former Ford engineer -- previously led teams that helped develop the iPod and the iPhone. The electric vehicle project is codenamed \"Titan,\" according to one person who spoke with WSJ. Although many of the sources cited by various media outlets appear to agree that the vehicle will use electric power, there are contradictory reports about whether or not the project is focused on driverless technology. The Journal's sources claimed that the current project is not exploring driverless technology, while an auto industry source cited by Reuters claimed that \"Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\"\n\nThe Journal's sources also pointed to a possible solution to Apple's lack of a manufacturing facility. Apple executives have supposedly held meetings with contract carmakers in Austria, including Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Canadian automobile parts manufacturer Magna International. Considering that Apple recently reported having $178 billion in cash and marketable securities, the company could also easily purchase a readymade car manufacturing facility if it wanted to.\n\nAs Tech Cheat Sheet reported earlier this week, this is not the first time that rumors of an Apple vehicle have surfaced. Company co-founder Steve Jobs was known to be interested in making a car, as he told The New York Times' John Markoff shortly before his death in 2011. More recently, Apple board member Mickey Drexler confirmed Jobs's fascination with cars during a discussion at Parsons The New School for Design last year. \"Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was going to design an iCar,\" stated Drexler.\n\nSince then, the extent of Apple's dabbling in this area seemed to be limited to developing an in-vehicle device integration system for the iPhone. First introduced as \"iOS in the Car\" at the Worldwide Developers Conference in 2013, the system was later rebranded as CarPlay in early 2014.\n\nHowever, the latest leaks suggest that Apple's automotive ambitions go far beyond bringing iOS to the dashboards of cars. Still, since the rumored car project was only initiated in late 2014, it will likely be several more years before an Apple car is ready for market. And even if the rumors are correct, there is always the possibility that Apple could abandon the project without ever bringing a vehicle to market. On the other hand, the day when car customers are able to choose between a Tesla and an Apple car may not be as far off as we think.\n\nFollow Nathanael on Twitter @ArnoldEtan_WSCS",

Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\n(Reuters says the project is for self-driving cars, but I tend to believe the WSJ more on Apple stuff.)\n\nMy immediate response was one I saw all over Twitter: that if Apple is already doing too much, what happens if this is true?\n\nI think this a valid concern, despite the knee-jerk humor. iOS and OS X are moving at a speed that doesn't feel sustainable, and a lot of the pro-Apple camp agree.[1]\n\nAll that aside, Apple moving deeper into the automotive industry is fascinating.\n\nCarPlay may not be perfect, but I think Apple could move the needle in a real way when it comes to in-car entertainment.\n\nMy car is less than a year old, and while it doesn't wear a luxury brand's badge, it came with a relatively sophisticated in-dash system, but it just kinda sucks in a bunch of ways. The software and hardware works, but it's clunky and unattractive ... not unlike the MP3 players of 2000 and the smart phones of 2006.\n\nThis rumor is about something way bigger than taking over the dashboard, however. While the Jobs-ruled Apple had shockingly low R&D budgets, that's changing under Tim Cook. It makes sense that a company of Apple's size spend time and money investigating new projects, and things learned in tinkering with an electric car could benefit lots of other Apple products.\n\nI don't think an R&D project is enough to light ourselves on fire concerning Apple being stretched too thin.\n\nWhile Project Titan may not end up sitting in my driveway any time soon, it very well could one day in the future. I think Cook and his team know, that at some point, Apple may need to branch out beyond consumer electronics. That may very well include a car -- or parts of a car -- at some point. The lines between the technology industry and the automotive industry are blurring.\n\nThat idea may not sit comfortably with me at this point, but I'm reminded of what people have said throughout the ages about a computer with a mouse, a music player from a dying computer company and a phone from PC guys.\n\nClearly electric vehicles are part of our future, and in many ways, Tesla is reminiscent of Apple. There have been reports for a while now of the two companies trading blows in the hiring market.\n\nSo, do I think Apple is building a car? I'm not convinced they are by this report, but I do think something strange is afoot at the Circle K. And anytime Cupertino moves into a new market, it's worth paying attention to what is going on.",

                    "body": "If you thought it has been a while since you heard any more rumors about the long-awaited Apple TV, they are about to be replaced by even more exciting possibility - that Apple may be about to build an electric car.\n\nThe Wall Steet Journal kicked things off with a report that Apple had been hiring \"hundreds\" of staff with automotive design skills to work on a project called \"Titan\" that may be a self-driving electric vehicle configured in a (not-so-exciting) mini-van design.\n\nThere are several back-stories to this potential move by Apple. In one, we see continuing competition with rival Google, who has been working on a driverless car for some time and are saying that they will be launching a commercial version onto the market between 2017 and 2020. Google's motivation behind the self-driving car has been the development of the artificial intelligence software capable of pulling off this feat. Even if the car is not successful, the AI software will have a range of applications and possibility that would make the project still worthwhile. Increasingly, Apple has shown its willingness to develop its own capability in a range of competitive technologies that it can incorporate into products.\n\nIn another back-story, there is electric car company Tesla whose CEO, Elon Musk, has claimed that it will be as big financially, as Apple, within a decade. This will in part be based on the release of the Model 3, an affordable (US $35,000) family car with a range of 200 miles. Part of Tesla's strategy appears to include the poaching of numerous Apple staff. Although it seems that Apple has been reciprocating by offering Tesla staff large signing bonuses to move to Apple.\n\nAnd finally there is the view that electric cars, self-driving or otherwise, represent the future of transportation, especially a climate-friendly and sustainable one. At first sight, this may be a bit hard to believe when you consider that the top 3 selling vehicles in the US in 2014 were \"pickup trucks\". At the same time, hybrid electric vehicles represented less than 3% of all cars sold. Still, there is continuing interest by the car manufacturers in producing electric cars, if only as a hedge. GM has announced their new 200 mile range Chevy Bolt that will retail at around the same price as Tesla's Model 3.\n\nThere is little doubt that Apple could move into car manufacturing. With US $180 billion in cash, it could buy Fiat Chrysler, Tesla, General Motors and Ford outright.\n\nThere is also no doubt that with its ability to bring design and innovative computing to an industry employing technology that significantly lags that found in an iPhone. Apple and Google have both made moves to create in-vehicle media interfaces based on their systems. Apple's CarPlay will start to appear in cars this year. Customers who can't wait can buy after-market devices from Pioneer.\n\nApple's motivation to build an electric car may be driven by competition with Google, Tesla and others. It may be also finding a new business that doubles its value to $1.3 trillion as predicted by Carl Icahn. Alternatively however, it may be genuinely interested in building a technology that makes driving more sustainable and less dependent on oil. Apple is set to invest $3 billion in new solar farms in California and Arizona to provide energy for its operations there. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told investors:\n\n\"We know that climate change is real,\" Cook said on Tuesday. \"Our view is that the time for talk has passed, and the time for action is now. We've shown that with what we've done.\"\n\nWhether Apple's electric cars are aimed at combating climate change will depend on how they are manufactured and how the recharging infrastructure, which is still largely to be built in the US and globally, is run. Apple throwing its weight behind this infrastructure being built at all would certainly help making electric cars a more popular possibility.\n\nBy David Glance, Director of UWA Centre for Software Practice at University of Western Australia.

It would take years to finish the project, and it is not certain if Apple would eventually build a car, the Journal said.\n\nThe news signals that Apple is sharply raising its ambitions for automotive technology, which has become a prime area of interest for Silicon Valley companies ranging from Google Inc to ride-sharing firm Uber to electric carmaker Tesla Motors Inc.\n\nThe connected car, or vehicles with a full range of Internet and software services beyond mere navigation and communications, is considered one of the ripest areas for expansion for technology companies.\n\nIn March last year, Apple unveiled CarPlay, which lets drivers access contacts on their iPhones, make calls or listen to voicemails without taking their hands off the steering wheel.\n\nNow, the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research and development unit, Johann Jungwirth, has defected to Apple, according to a LinkedIn profile, which said his title was head of Mac Systems Engineering.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Financial Times reported earlier that Apple had created the secret lab and that Jungwirth had joined the new research team.\n\nTwo sources told reporters that Apple has recently tried to recruit from the automotive industry in fields such as robotics.\n\nThe research lab was set up late last year, soon after Apple revealed its forthcoming smartwatch and latest iPhones, the Financial Times said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said that the Apple project, code-named \"Titan,\" employed several hundred people working a few miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California.\n\nApple executives have met with contract manufacturers including Magna Steyr, a unit of Magna International Inc. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nGoogle is working on plans for a self-driving car, but that is not part of Apple's plan, the Journal said.\n\nTrying to design and build an actual car would mark a change for the iPhone maker, which researches and discards plenty of projects, but has so far mainly stuck to its core expertise in mobile and electronic devices.\n\nHowever, it has been open about wanting to integrate its core iOS software into automobiles with CarPlay.\n\nAlong with HomeKit and HealthKit, the idea is to extend Apple's software dominance into industries including home devices, healthcare and automobiles.",

Adding further credence to the rumors is a new report published today by Financial Times that claims Apple is hiring automotive experts to work on a secret project.\n\nAccording to Financial Times sources, several Apple employees led by managers from the iPhone unit are researching automotive products at its confidential lab. Apple's Jonathan Ive has also been meeting a number of automotive executives and engineers recently in an attempt to hire talented people from the industry for a secret Apple project.\n\nThe secret lab where the project is being conceptualized was apparently set up soon after the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus announcement last year. So even if Apple is indeed working on a car, or should we say 'iCar', the actual product may not be ready until a few years. However, most of the sources familiar with the matter believe that Apple is indeed working on a car and not something related to cars like an OS for cars or other forms of software. Apple has recently hired a number of people who are experts in automotive design and vehicle dynamics, which makes it clear that Apple isn't working on any kind of an automotive software solution.\n\nCould Apple be working on a self-driving car like Google? Or is it planning on taking on Tesla with a range of electric vehicles? These are some of the questions that we hope to find answers to in the next couple of months, or perhaps years.",

Separate reports from The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal both say that Apple is eyeing the car business and the Journal has learned a lot more details about Apple's plans to build a car of its own. The bottom line: The project might be a lot more exciting than it may initially sound.\n\nFROM EARLIER: It's time to start taking those Apple Car rumors seriously\n\nAccording to the publication, Tim Cook approved the car project almost a year ago, putting in charge Vice President Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer who helped lead the teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nZadesky apparently can hire up to 1,000 people to work on the car team and he can poach personnel from various parts of the company. This Apple project is apparently so hot that it convinced many to continue their employment at Apple instead of throwing in the towel because of \"the pressure of churning new products every year.\" So far, the team has hundreds of people working on the project.\n\nEven though the first car Apple is working on may not be a sexy sportscar -- the Journal says Apple's first car might be an electric minivan, codenamed Titan -- developing a car of its own might help Apple develop and use a variety of new technologies in some its current projects.\n\nThe publication says that Apple might decide not to build a car of its own after all, as not all the projects it's developing turn into commercial products. But technologies such as advanced batteries -- a problem smartphone makers have yet to truly solve -- and in-car electronics could be used for future generations of devices, including iPhones and iPads.\n\nAlso interesting is the fact that the current car team is researching \"different type of robotics, metals and materials, consistent with automobile manufacturing.\"\n\nFinally, even if an Apple car project might be years away, Apple certainly has the resources to make it happen. Not to mention that the perspective of having to compete against Apple on top of the many other \"traditional\" carmakers developing smarter, more efficient cars might put additional pressure on others, including Google, Uber and Tesla.",

It started with news of the strange sensor packed vans, which by all accounts were just a false alarm and 3D mapping vehicles. The rumors started to gain more steam when Elon Musk suggested Apple was trying to recruit Tesla employees.\n\nNow BusinessInsider, FinancialTimes, and the Wall Street Journal all have indications that the company is in the early stages of a car project. Tim Cook reportedly green-lighted the project code-named \"Titan\" almost a year ago, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nProject Titan is in its earliest stages and while Apple often investigates potential products and technologies building prototypes, the reported size of the group indicated a certain seriousness. We now have indications that Apple is seeking talent in the automotive arena much like it did in the health and fashion world before the Apple Watch.\n\nAn Apple employee told BusinessInsider that, \"Apple's latest project is too exciting to pass up. I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nThe group has set up shop at its own development facility away from the main campus. Reports range from \"several dozen\" to \"several hundred\" employees working on the project. Apple iPod and iPhone designer Steve Zadesky, formerly of Ford, is to be said to be running the project and Apple has reportedly begun to meet with contract manufacturers.\n\nThe WSJ says that the company is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan.\n\nThe Financial Times has indicated that former Mercedes-Benz R&D head Johann Jungwirth is also among the group.\n\nApple design chief Jony Ive is believed to be personally recruiting automotive executives and Elon Musk indicated that Apple had offered $250K bonuses and 60 percent raises to those willing to come to Apple.\n\nThere seems to be decent evidence that Apple is at the very least exploring a vehicle and I'm sure this will be the first of many series of rumors as this advances forward. While a car would be a large endeavor it would not be unthinkable, as even Steve Jobs expressed interest in building a car. Jobs once told a New York Times reporter he would have loved to take on Detroit. Former Apple board member Mickey Drexler also said Jobs wanted to make a car.\n\nCurrent Apple high ranking executives Eddy Cue, SVP of Internet Services, is on the board of Ferrari and Phil Schiller, SVP of marketing, is a car guy. Schiller's twitter bio reads \"Apple, Sports, Cars,... It's Racing Season\" and even has a photo of a Porsche pinned to the top of his Twitter profile.",

Something is going on according to a frenzy of articles, which appeared late last week and over the weekend from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Reuters, Financial Times, Quartz and others.\n\nThe WSJ reported that \"Apple has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, [which] has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan . . .\" A minivan?\n\nThe Financial Times stated that Apple hired the head of Mercedes-Benz R & D, Johann Jungwirth, to support the company's new car initiative and that it has also been trying to hire Tesla employees, even as Telsa seeks to lure away Apple employees.\n\nReuters also reported that Apple was simultaneously looking into autonomous driving:\n\nApple is gathering advice on parts and production methods, focusing on electric and connected-car technologies, while studying the potential for automated driving, the source said.\n\n\"Fully automated driving is an evolution. Carmakers will slowly build the market for autonomous cars by first releasing connected and partially automated cars,\" the auto industry source said. \"Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\"\n\nThat would appear to answer the question of the mystery minivan linked to Apple that was seen driving around the streets of Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area earlier this month.\n\nThe Apple car initiative has apparently been in process for at least a year under the leadership of product design VP Steve Zadesky (a former Ford engineer), who is building a \"1,000 person team.\"\n\nApple previously announced Car Play, the in-dash iOS-based system designed to integrate with Apple devices. And it was known that Steve Jobs had flirted with developing an iCar. But actually prototyping and building it would be significant new undertaking and well beyond the scope of anything the company has done to date.\n\nPiper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster thinks we won't be seeing an iCar any time soon (for at least five years). According to a research note obtained by Business Insider, Munster says that the likely purpose of the leaked news is two-fold:\n\nTo give investors confidence that Apple has some new, big products in the pipeline (to sustain/boost its stock) To help with hiring of would-be employees for the division\n\nWhile it's entirely possible that Apple won't build its own car -- it might be developing software and other systems -- it's pretty interesting and exciting to consider what a self-driving Apple Car might look like or how different it might be from what exits today.\n\nPostscript: Jason Calacanis, in one of his email missives, just made a pretty thoughtful case why Apple (if it really wants to make a car) can/should/will buy Tesla. His hypothetical deal value is $75 billion, which would be 3X Telsa's current market cap. Apple has roughly $178 billion in cash on hand.\n\nAttend MarTech and hear first-hand how brands like Coca-Cola, Aetna, Dell, EMC and Netflix are harnessing the power of technology to produce exceptional customer experiences that deliver business results.

Among those assigned to Titan is Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer and current Apple product design vice president.\n\nThe report also highlights the importance of Apple's recent decision to hire Marc Newson, a highly respected former Ford designer who is best known for his 1999 021C concept car design. Newson is also known for his sleek product aesthetic that include cameras, smart watches, spaceplanes and more. Apple is clearly looking to Newson for help in crafting exciting designs for some of Apple's most ambitious projects. Check out our gallery of his work below:\n\nThese reports and rumors have also been independently confirmed by The Mac Observer, who added \"that Apple has been looking for -- and acquiring -- the kind of people from Tesla with expertise that is most suited to cars. So much so that I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly.\"\n\nWhat to expect from an Apple electric car\n\nIf Apple's plans to build their electric car comes to fruition, it will no doubt generate tremendous buzz among consumers and the media looking for something truly revolutionary from Apple. Although Titan represents a bold new move for Apple, in many ways the building of an electric car makes sense. As we accelerate towards a world where the Internet of Things, in which all electronic devices communicate with each other wirelessly, is commonplace, Apple's OS ecosphere will have the opportunity to extend into whole new market segments and data spheres. Imagine an Apple electric car that seamlessly integrates with Maps, iTunes and other OS-based apps. Everything you observe or experience in an Apple electric vehicle will interact with all other Apple devices and software. One obvious benefit to this would be Siri, who, in an electric car, would truly become a virtual assistant with a variety of new responsibilities. Hopefully, more information will be disclosed in the coming months.\n\n(featured image is merely an artist's conception and does not represent an actual Apple design)\n\nEmail",

The vehicle was said to have 12 cameras on top.\n\nThe car is not yet the Apple vehicle that is being developed by the company but a Dodge minivan so it is likely that the vehicle is on a test mission.\n\nApple is into something new\n\nIt is not surprising to find out that Apple is going into the development of an electric and electronically-powered car.\n\nLast year, Mickey Drexler, a board member of the American tech company revealed that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs was already considering building an Apple car. He told then that Steve Jobs was going to design an iCar which will most likely have an extraordinary and cool design.\n\nThe notion that Apple is into car development is further fuelled by reports that a significant number of Apple employees, supposedly spearheaded by its experienced managers from its iPhone unit, are now researching automotive industry products at a confidential Silicon Valley location.\n\nThese reports came from sources close to Apple personnel who are doing the research at the moment. The same sources cited that the company has set up the secret laboratory late last year. Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive, who is known to be a car enthusiast, is reportedly overseeing the ongoing research activity in the secret laboratory.\n\nIn-car entertainment initially\n\nInitial reports on this project by sources claim that Apple is into the development of an in-car entertainment system known as CarPlay but considering the resources and large research ensemble that the company has put together, they know it is something bigger.\n\nOne of the sources said that if the same research team worked on an in-car entertainment system project, they could have finished it by this time. The CarPlay should be out by this time but apparently the research team is still working so it is likely that they are working on a car, the sources added.\n\nAn e-mail from an anonymous employee also confirmed to a business magazine that the company is into vehicle information but did not disclose any further information.",

Apple was naturally tight-lipped on the whole ordeal and refused to comment.\n\nIt's reported that Vice President Steve Zadesky has been assigned to head the group. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer, so the automotive background is certainly evident. Other notable hirings include the September hiring of Johann Jungwirth, the former R&D President and Chief Executive at Mercedes Benz North America and Marc Newson, a longtime friend of Apple designer Jony Ive, and a designer who has created concept car designs for Ford.\n\nWhile hiring former auto-industry executives might not create much smoke on its own, it's also been reported that Apple has had employees researching robotics and materials consistent with automotive factories as well as automotive products.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also reminds us that while starting an auto manufacturing facility is quite expensive, Apple might be singularly qualified to handle that expense:\n\nManufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components. Elon Musk , the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Motors Inc., said last fall that it is \"really hard\" to make a car, as the company struggled to ramp up production on its Model S sedan.\n\nThe expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27, 2014.\n\nThese latest rumors have probably been fueled by the alleged Apple minivans seen driving around California recently. It was reported that these were some sort of self-driving cars, though they looked more like mapping vehicles to potentially help Apple Maps compete with the much more established Google Maps. For what it's worth, those pesky \"people familiar with the project\" say that self-driving cars are not part of Apple's current project.\n\nApple has already dabbled with the auto industry with their upcoming Car Play functionality. It's possible that creating their own car could be the next step. Or it's entirely possible that the whole project will be scrapped, or the research will go towards other project, or any number of other potential outcomes.\n\nWhat do you think about this potential foray into the automotive industry? Will Apple create the iPod of cars? Will this project even come to fruition? Let us know what you think in the comments, or on Google+, Facebook, or Twitter.",

The company is reportedly hiring many in the auto industry and in automotive technology to work on a project that will \"give Tesla a run for its money,\" according to an email from an Apple employee.\n\n\"Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay,\" said an unnamed source who has worked closely with Apple for many years. \"Today I think it's a car.\"\n\nWhether Apple actually will unveil a new car or not, it is becoming more clear that Apple is looking into entering a new market space. Apple has reportedly been offering Tesla employees massive salary bumps and $250,000 in signing bonuses to come over to Apple.\n\nApple chief designer Jonathan Ive has also reportedly been having regular meetings with executives in the automotive industry in attempts to hire them. Among those Ive has spoken with was reportedly a head of research and development at Mercedes-Benz.\n\nMaking a move into the auto industry would be difficult for Apple, which currently doesn't have the ability to manufacture cars.\n\nIt's also possible that Apple is not building a car of its own at all, but rather a car-related product, such as self-driving technology to rival Google, street-mapping equipment or even developments to CarPlay. It's also likely that any product to come out of Apple's so-called secret lab would still be at least a few years away.\n\nThe secret lab is said to be led by many of the same team that first developed the iPhone.\n\nNews of this team follows what was revealed to be a fleet of vehicles with mounted cameras, similar to the Google cars used by Google for its Maps service. These vans, however, sport at least a dozen cameras and what seems to be LiDAR modules for higher resolution mapping.\n\nApple is one of many large tech companies making the shift to the auto industry. Google has been working on its self-driving cars for a number of years now, and it's likely that Apple would want to have a competing product.",

                    "body": "Rumors that Apple (AAPL) might be developing a self-driving car have heated up. The company is said to be talking to carmaking experts and suppliers about a long-range plan to create a self-driving electric vehicle.\n\nAccording to some of the reports, a vehicle will look like a minivan and be designed in-house. But absent yet-to-be-offered (and unlikely) confirmation from Apple, parsing the reports -- whether Apple is taking such a sharp strategic shift or the reports are significantly off base -- requires a look at the company's situation.\n\nApple just hit a revenue record and new high in profits. Growth has been beyond what watchers had expected. But the growth was due to the success of the iPhone in China. The success is undeniable, but nothing else that Apple has done comes close to the massive popularity and profitability of the device. Mac sales are strong but nowhere near this level, while iPad unit sales continue to trend downward.\n\nThe iPhone has two factors that enable its soaring performance. One is that many wireless carriers provide some degree of subsidy up front. Consumers do eventually pay the whole cost through higher monthly service charges, but they don't notice that the real price for their iPhone 6 is almost $690. The other is the propensity for people to get a new smartphone every two years when they're eligible for the next subsidy.\n\nIn other words, built within Apple's success is a serious weakness. Too much depends on the iPhone. The company needs to diversify, easing its reliance on one product.\n\nMarry that with the understanding that Apple, unlike a Google (GOOG) or Microsoft (MSFT), has been focused on a narrow area and number of products. With the introduction of the first iPod, it made itself into a consumer-electronics company.\n\nThat category doesn't need to mean only handheld devices. Apple has been active in the home, whether through Apple TV -- a product that has never hit the comparative big time -- or announced support for home automation. One area other than home and work where people use electronics is in a car. Apple first publicly showed an interest in automobiles through a patent filing five years ago. Apple CarPlay debuted in March 2014.\n\nEven beyond entertainment, modern cars carry lots of electronics. Does that mean Apple would design an entire vehicle? Possibly, but the shift in its business model would be staggering. The engineering effort in creating a new vehicle is massive, with a scale beyond anything Apple has tried.\n\nPlus, regulatory requirements are far more extensive. Customer service and repair are orders of magnitude more complex than what consumers get at an Apple Genius Bar in one of the company's stores.\n\nNot to say that such a shift is impossible. From its incorporation in 2003, Tesla Motors (TSLA) clearly established itself as a viable and, ultimately, profitable company. Apple certainly has the money to create a design, but for broad acceptance it would likely need service centers for repairs, showrooms for sales and compliance with existing recharging stations to make the cars practical.\n\nPerhaps Apple is looking to build a car from the tires up. Or maybe it's seeking a middle ground in an all-or-nothing discussion. Apple might be readying a series of electronics, including self-driving, collision detection, cameras and entertainment, which could be delivered as a package to carmakers to create their own Apple-branded versions.\n\nOr Apple might, indeed, be planning to develop and sell a complete car. In that case, don't expect anything to happen for years. Look how long it took to simply introduce the Apple Watch, and even that isn't yet shipping.\n\nAnd even if it become a carmaker, other Apple products have shown that a runaway hit capable of totally changing an industry is anything but guaranteed.",

Numerous publications have reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook started the project about a year ago, which followed a M&A meeting with Tesla's Elon Musk in the Spring of 2013.\n\nWe must remember that Apple has many R&D projects and \"says no a thousand times for every yes\" and of course even if the car project does happen, any type of product is many years off (barring any acquisition). Then there is the current mess that is CarPlay...\n\nBut the idea does make some sense on a macro level. Tim Cook's Apple is a Green company and takes on the world's problems including Global Warming. Electric cars, when coupled with clean energy, cut Co2 emissions.\n\n\"We know at Apple that climate change is real... our view is the time for talk is past and the time for action is now\" - Tim Cook on the recent opening of Apple's monster solar project\n\nExecs including Eddie Cue (Ferrari's Board), Phil Schiller (who testified in the Samsung trial that Apple considered making a car before the iPhone) and Jony \"Aston/Bentley\" Ive (pictured above, shotgun) are known for their interest in cars.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling argument is that Apple, which sits on $200B cash mountain and looks for areas ripe for disruption, can make a very short list of industries bigger than the consumer electronics industry that it now dominates.\n\nIf you consider household capital expenditures, cars are second only to housing. The auto industry is a trillion dollar a year industry. That's a big pie, even if Apple hopes to just take a small piece. Tesla thinks it can hit Apple's current valuation in a decade, just by selling electric cars and batteries.\n\nFor the record, I'd heard from people outside of Apple that they were hiring people that could only be working on electric cars. Without solid proof and with the knowledge that they'd hired auto folks like Doug Field to actually work on Macintosh hardware development in the past, we had nothing to go on.\n\nThe Industry\n\nAs an electric car enthusiast who drives two different electric cars and writes about the clean energy/electric car industry, I couldn't be happier about the prospect of Apple joining the electric car industry. I am a big Tesla fan but I think an Apple car would be great for the whole electric vehicle ecosystem. Even the rumor of Apple's electric vehicle entry has cast a bright light on the technology.\n\nEvery major carmaker has some sort of electric car initiative and the prospect of Apple taking over their industry will only spur investment in the field. Nissan's Leaf which debuted with ads on iAd, now is the only mainstream fully electric car, but many more are just around the corner.\n\nApple has the resources to expand vehicle charging infrastructure, battery technology and even influence government regulations.\n\nElectric and autonomous transportation is clearly the future and Apple's entry would be good for everyone outside of the legacy car and oil industry.",

The people said that the first design resembles a minivan.\n\nCEO Tim Cook last year approved the car project and assigned product design VP Steve Zadesky to lead the group, sources said. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone. He was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and take employees from different parts of the company.\n\nWorking from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.\n\nJonathan Ive's team of Apple designers has held regular meetings with automotive executives and engineers in recent months, in some cases trying to hire them. Recent recruits to Apple's team include the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley R&D unit. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, an industrial designer and friend of Ive, who created a concept card for Ford Motor.\n\nApple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, a source said. A side benefit of the project, according to one of the people, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on the new endeavor without the pressure of churning new products every year. Earlier this week, Business Insider reported that it had received an email from someone claiming to be an Apple employee, which said the iPhone maker's latest project would \"give Tesla a run for its money\".\n\nApple and Magna declined to comment on the reports.",

                    "body": "It's difficult to grasp what a successful company Apple is until you take the time to gather and digest news from the past week or two\n\nEveryone knows that Apple had a great fourth quarter and that its most successful product line, the iPhone, is doing better than ever, too.\n\nBut it's difficult to grasp what a mind-blowingly successful company Apple is until you take the time to gather and digest news about the company that has emerged in the past week or two.\n\nI've done it. And it has become obvious to me that Apple is not only successful, not only the most successful company in technology, not only the most successful company in the world but the most successful company in the history of companies.\n\nIs that an extreme statement? Maybe. But let me make my case, and we'll see if you disagree.\n\nHere are the 11 ways that Apple is the most successful company in history.\n\n1. Apple is the world's most valuable company\n\nAt the close of markets Thursday, Apple's value as determined by its stock price was $728.35 billion. That's nearly twice the market value of the world's second most valuable company, Exxon-Mobil.\n\nSome experts disagree with the market about the value of the company. Activist investor Carl Icahn thinks Apple is \"dramatically undervalued,\" and is actually worth $1.25 trillion.\n\n2. Apple is the world's most valuable brand\n\nSeveral organizations rank global brands on various metrics, and all the major ones rank Apple's as the world's most valuable brand. For example, the Forbes list ranks Apple's brand as twice as valuable as Microsoft, the world's second most valuable brand, and far more valuable than Google, the third.\n\n3. Apple makes more money than any company ever\n\nApple recently reported revenue of $74.6 billion and a mind-blowing $18 billion in profits for a single quarter, which is the largest quarterly earnings of any company ever.\n\nThis is astonishing especially by comparison. The big money maker is the iPhone. In an industry with dozens of major players and hundreds of minor ones, where most companies lost money, some break even and actual profits are extremely rare, Apple by itself earned 93% of all smartphone handset profits in the fourth quarter.\n\n4. Apple's cash flow problem is that it doesn't spend enough\n\nApple reported a cash hoard of $178 billion. That's literally enough cash to buy every car company in America and still have billions left over.\n\nMost of that money is offshore (in Ireland, actually). Apple can't invest it or return it to investors without also breaking records in the paying of taxes, which Apple doesn't want to do.\n\n5. Apple has crushed (or co-opted) all rivals\n\nApple is famous for its rivalries. Under Steve Jobs, Apple spent nearly $1 million in 1984 on a Super Bowl commercial vilifying IBM as \"Big Brother.\"\n\nApple's early years were consumed with direct competition with Microsoft, which in the 1990s Microsoft won.\n\nLater, Jobs would declare \"thermonuclear war\" against Google for acquiring and promoting Android.\n\nMore recently, Apple clashed with Samsung in a war over design, patents and market share.\n\nAll these conflicts have been resolved with Apple winning.\n\nApple, which was once a fraction of the size and held a fraction of the PC market share of Microsoft, is now valued higher than both Microsoft and Google combined. Microsoft is in something of a rebirth in part because it has followed Apple's approach in mobile (touch tablets, for example, instead of pen-based tablets) and embraced iOS for Office and other products.\n\nIBM has been brought to heel as a junior partner for the IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps program. IBM is hoping that some of the Apple magic will rub off on IBM's mobile enterprise group.\n\nSamsung has now been officially crushed as a smartphone rival to Apple. The score? Apple 93, Samsung 9 (I'm talking about percentage of profits in the smartphone business.)\n\n6. Apple is building the world's coolest headquarters\n\nThe best place in the world for a tech company, of course, is Silicon Valley. But the truth is that Silicon Valley \"campuses\" tend to be boring, generic, non-descript \"office parks.\" Silicon Valley is ugly.\n\nSure, the Googleplex in Mountain View is vaguely cool, with it's life-size T-rex statue and goofy multi-colored bicycles made famous by \"The Internship.\" The Oracle headquarters are kind of cool. Everyone wants to swim in \"Lake Larry.\" Twitter's San Francisco offices are a delightful, post-modern confection.\n\nBut Apple's insane, bad-ass spaceship campus will rule them all. It sits on real estate made extremely valuable mostly by, well, by proximity to Apple. The ugly stuff (the major road connecting the main building with a nearby boulevard, plus some parking, functional buildings and utilitarian functions like heating, cooling, power, etc.) are underground or shoved to the periphery and out of sight.\n\nThe main event is the pristine doughnut of a building that, according to Steve Jobs, doesn't have a single pane of flat glass. It's all curved. (Apple built a factory in Germany to make that glass.) And the main building is surrounded by trees and grass and local habitat.\n\nThe most underappreciated feature of the new campus is an underground theater where Apple will announce new products. Because it will be under company control, Apple will be able to invite journalists on a few days notice, and will be able to prevent the inevitable product leaks that come from spy shots of San Francisco's Moscone Center.\n\nPlus, we learned this week that the campus will be 100% solar powered.\n\nThe new Apple spaceship campus will be awesome. Here comes the video.\n\n7. Apple has mostly solved the phone theft problem\n\nWe learned this week that, thanks to Activation Lock, iPhone thefts are down 50% in London, 40% in San Francisco and 25% in New York.\n\nWhen is the last time a social problem like crime was cut in half by a new technology?\n\nCall it a massive success for Apple.\n\n8. Apple has mostly solved the app discovery problem\n\nApple's iOS and Google's Android dominate the smartphone market partly because they've attracted the world's mobile app developers. iOS has roughly 1.21 million apps in the App Store.\n\nNow Apple is partnering with Pinterest to re-invent app discovery with a new Pinterest feature called App Pins. The feature enables Pinterest users to pin apps to their boards like any other content, but with apps downloadable directly from Pinterest.\n\nApp Pins make iOS apps much more discoverable and social.\n\n9. Apple has mostly solved the China problem\n\nThe world's most populous country is experiencing a massive explosion in home-grown smartphone brands, including Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi, ZTE, Oppo, Umi, Zopo and Meizu.\n\nThese companies are starting to clobber foreign competitors in China. Samsung, which used to dominate the Chinese market, is getting hammered by home-grown upstarts.\n\nIt's getting very hard for any non-Chinese handset maker to compete in the Chinese market.\n\nExcept Apple. Canalys says Apple is now the number-one smartphone maker in China. (Note that this is a controversial conclusion; some market research firms think Apple is number two in China.)\n\n10. Apple has mostly solved the wearables problem\n\nCompanies from Google to Pebble to Samsung to Sony have been trying to mainstream smartwatches without success. The most popular platform to date is Google's Android Wear, which we've recently learned has sold about 720,000 units, falling far short of the 1 million watch mark and representing only about 15% of the 4.6 million smart watches shipped last year, according to Canalys.\n\nNearly all analysts are predicting that Apple will surpass this number in the first few days or weeks of the Apple Watch's release. For example, JP Morgan says Apple will sell 26 million Apple Watches this year; Morgan Stanley says 30 million and Cantor Fitzgerald predicts 37 million.\n\nThe problem Apple has solved is that Apple understands that a wearable has to be plugged into your nervous system and be made part of your physical body. (Apple's doing this with a combination of touch, haptics, sound and visual elements.\n\n11. Apple's biggest business opportunity has barely started\n\nWhile Japan, Scandinavia and Kenya have been plowing forward for years on mobile payments, backwater America has been trapped in an old-and-busted credit card hell.\n\nWe've heard the predictions and promises. For years, companies like Google and others have failed to capture the public imagination with a viable mobile payments system that real people would actually use.\n\nThen along comes Apple with Apple Pay, and it appears to be winning in the U.S. market. Some two-thirds of all contactless payments are now made with Apple Pay.\n\nApple is winning because it zeroed in on the main barrier to mainstream acceptance: convenience. Simply tapping an iPhone to an NFC reader while holding it with your thumb on the fingerprint reader is all you need to do to buy stuff with Apple Pay.\n\nThis is possible only because of the unique fingerprint reader Apple uses, which other companies cannot use because Apple owns it (from their acquisition of AuthenTec).\n\nI believe Apple Pay will grow massively in the next few years to become an even bigger business for Apple than the iPhone.\n\nAll of these successes add up to Apple clearly being the most successful company in history. No other company has ever made this much money, won on so many fronts or positioned itself to keep on winning.\n\nJoin the CIO newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.",

                    "body": "There's a hole in the digital hub. All day long we have a unique, immediate connection to the places we go, whether it's through an iPhone, Apple TV or, soon enough, an Apple Watch. HomeKit has brought a sense of unity to the Internet of Things. HealthKit has laid the foundation for a bridge between patient and doctor. Digital Touch gives us a quick, spontaneous way to communicate with our distant friends and loved ones.\n\nBut all that stops the moment we step into a car. CarPlay can link with our phones and let us dial and talk through our dashboards, but for the most part, the technology in our automobiles pales in comparison to what's in our pockets.\n\nEven Tesla's ultra-modern interior of screens and digital sliders is still on an island of its own -- no matter how luxurious it is when you're behind the wheel, the experience is bound by the four doors. And now it looks like Apple is trying to change that. If you missed the rumors late last week, somewhere in a secret lab at 1 Infinite Loop, Jony Ive is working on perhaps his greatest undertaking: a full-fledged automobile.\n\nWhen Eddie Cue demoed \"iOS in the Car\" back at WWDC in 2013, it seemed a bit half-baked. As he zipped through maps, messages and music, I was waiting for a wow moment that never came. By working with existing manufacturers, Apple was constricted by the screens and systems in place. iOS in the Car certainly looked better than any in-dash entertainment I had seen before -- especially the one that's in my Hyundai Veloster -- but it didn't really bring anything new to the table. It was like putting lipstick on a Siri-powered pig.\n\nIt's the same problem I had with the Motorola ROKR. Dubbed the Apple iTunes phone, it was supposed to bring a bit of the iPod ingenuity to our handsets, but in reality it merely created a bridge to the music locked on our Macs. The interface was a cheap imitation of the iPod's intuitive menu structure, and it was wrapped in a substandard package that tried to imagine what an Apple phone would look like. Basically, Apple was at Motorola's mercy, because no matter how good the iTunes app was, it was only part of the experience. And that's not how Apple operates.\n\nWith cars, Apple has even less control. Not only does CarPlay need to span a broad spectrum of manufacturers, it also has to be designed with an interface generic enough to work with both touch- and dial-controlled systems. It's a less-than-desirable solution, but there's no other way for Apple to make a true push into automobiles -- just like it needed Motorola in 2005 to get its foot into the door of the cell phone industry.\n\nWhen you think about it, the flood of reports last week from the likes of Reuters, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal was fairly inevitable. After the ROKR, we were certain Apple was working on its own phone. Almost as soon as Apple TV was released, rumors of flat-screen television sets emerged. And now that CarPlay is beginning to make its way into vehicles, here come the iCar rumors.\n\nApple has transformed its share of products and industries, but automobiles are a whole other story. It certainly has the capital to invest in such an undertaking, but Apple doesn't exactly have a history of dabbling. And if there really is a team of hundreds of people are working on the project right at the time all resourses should be dedicated to Apple Watch, Tim Cook is certainly serious about whatever he's building.\n\nBut if a Cupertino car is indeed in the works, it won't be judged on its horsepower and torque. Much like the iPhone is more than the sum of its RAM and clock speed, an Apple car will need to deliver an experience unlike anything we've ever driven, seamlessly transitioning our digital lives without missing a beat.\n\nImagine a car that not only recognizes who's driving, but also where they're going, what they need to do when they get there, and what they want to listen to along the way. With the iPhone and Apple Watch, Apple has an opportunity to create a navigation system that's truly smart and a heads-up display that personalizes the trip based on the Apple Watch on the wrist of the person sitting in the driver's seat.\n\nThe song you were listening to on your Mac could continue playing when you start the engine. The quickest route to the office could be automatically set based on the time of day. A reminder could alert you to buy milk when you drive past a grocery store. It could give you a minute-by-minute weather forecast. And it could send a message to your thermostat when it notices you're on your way home.\n\nBut just like the killer app of the original iPhone was making calls, the killer feature of an Apple car would obviously be driving. While the connectivity and handoff features would certainly add trememndous value to whatever kind of vehicle Apple makes, it will, above all, still be a car. Rumors point to it being electric (which is a bit of a no-brainer), but what intrigues me is the self-driving aspect. We've already seen a prototype of driverless car from Google, but a healthy dose of Apple ingenuity could be what the technology needs to get off the ground.\n\nAssuming this isn't Tim Cook's version of an early April Fool's Day joke, however, I'm not so sure we'll ever see an Apple car on the road (and I'm downright certain it won't be a minivan, as the Journal suggested). Apple's top-secret auto project doesn't need to produce anything drivable to be worth the time investment; the knowledge gained about batteries, seamless connectivity, and location awareness would be invaluable to any of Apple's current products, especially CarPlay, which Cook has already deemed \"very, very important\" to the evolution of the ecosystem.\n\nBut then again, we've been down this road before.

                    "body": "There's a hole in the digital hub. All day long we have a unique, immediate connection to the places we go, whether it's through an iPhone, Apple TV or, soon enough, an Apple Watch. HomeKit has brought a sense of unity to the Internet of Things. HealthKit has laid the foundation for a bridge between patient and doctor. Digital Touch gives us a quick, spontaneous way to communicate with our distant friends and loved ones.\n\nBut all that stops the moment we step into a car. CarPlay can link with our phones and let us dial and talk through our dashboards, but for the most part, the technology in our automobiles pales in comparison to what's in our pockets.\n\nEven Tesla's ultra-modern interior of screens and digital sliders is still on an island of its own--no matter how luxurious it is when you're behind the wheel, the experience is bound by the four doors. And now it looks like Apple is trying to change that. If you missed the rumors late last week, somewhere in a secret lab at 1 Infinite Loop, Jony Ive is working on perhaps his greatest undertaking: a full-fledged automobile.\n\nLimited visibility\n\nWhen Eddie Cue demoed \"iOS in the Car\" back at WWDC in 2013, it seemed a bit half-baked. As he zipped through maps, messages and music, I was waiting for a wow moment that never came. By working with existing manufacturers, Apple was constricted by the screens and systems in place. iOS in the Car certainly looked better than any in-dash entertainment I had seen before--especially the one that's in my Hyundai Veloster--but it didn't really bring anything new to the table. It was like putting lipstick on a Siri-powered pig.\n\nIt's the same problem I had with the Motorola ROKR. Dubbed the Apple iTunes phone, it was supposed to bring a bit of the iPod ingenuity to our handsets, but in reality it merely created a bridge to the music locked on our Macs. The interface was a cheap imitation of the iPod's intuitive menu structure, and it was wrapped in a substandard package that tried to imagine what an Apple phone would look like. Basically, Apple was at Motorola's mercy, because no matter how good the iTunes app was, it was only part of the experience. And that's not how Apple operates.\n\nWith cars, Apple has even less control. Not only does CarPlay need to span a broad spectrum of manufacturers, it also has to be designed with an interface generic enough to work with both touch- and dial-controlled systems. It's a less-than-desirable solution, but there's no other way for Apple to make a true push into automobiles--just like it needed Motorola in 2005 to get its foot into the door of the cell phone industry.\n\nOpen road\n\nWhen you think about it, the flood of reports last week from the likes of Reuters, the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal was fairly inevitable. After the ROKR, we were certain Apple was working on its own phone. Almost as soon as Apple TV was released, rumors of flat-screen television sets emerged. And now that CarPlay is beginning to make its way into vehicles, here come the iCar rumors.\n\nApple has transformed its share of products and industries, but automobiles are a whole other story. It certainly has the capital to invest in such an undertaking, but Apple doesn't exactly have a history of dabbling. And if there really is a team of hundreds of people are working on the project right at the time all resourses should be dedicated to Apple Watch, Tim Cook is certainly serious about whatever he's building.\n\nBut if a Cupertino car is indeed in the works, it won't be judged on its horsepower and torque. Much like the iPhone is more than the sum of its RAM and clock speed, an Apple car will need to deliver an experience unlike anything we've ever driven, seamlessly transitioning our digital lives without missing a beat.\n\nUltimate driving machine\n\nImagine a car that not only recognizes who's driving, but also where they're going, what they need to do when they get there, and what they want to listen to along the way. With the iPhone and Apple Watch, Apple has an opportunity to create a navigation system that's truly smart and a heads-up display that personalizes the trip based on the Apple Watch on the wrist of the person sitting in the driver's seat.\n\nThe song you were listening to on your Mac could continue playing when you start the engine. The quickest route to the office could be automatically set based on the time of day. A reminder could alert you to buy milk when you drive past a grocery store. It could give you a minute-by-minute weather forecast. And it could send a message to your thermostat when it notices you're on your way home.\n\nBut just like the killer app of the original iPhone was making calls, the killer feature of an Apple car would obviously be driving. While the connectivity and handoff features would certainly add trememndous value to whatever kind of vehicle Apple makes, it will, above all, still be a car. Rumors point to it being electric (which is a bit of a no-brainer), but what intrigues me is the self-driving aspect. We've already seen a prototype of driverless car from Google, but a healthy dose of Apple ingenuity could be what the technology needs to get off the ground.\n\nZero to 60\n\nAssuming this isn't Tim Cook's version of an early April Fool's Day joke, however, I'm not so sure we'll ever see an Apple car on the road (and I'm downright certain it won't be a minivan, as the Journal suggested). Apple's top-secret auto project doesn't need to produce anything drivable to be worth the time investment; the knowledge gained about batteries, seamless connectivity, and location awareness would be invaluable to any of Apple's current products, especially CarPlay, which Cook has already deemed \"very, very important\" to the evolution of the ecosystem.\n\nBut then again, we've been down this road before. Less than a year and a half after the first fruits of its Motorola partnership, we were introduced to the iPhone. Steve Jobs wasn't content to have just a part of a phone, he wanted to build an end-to-end solution that was pure Apple. A car may be a bit further outside of Apple's purview than a phone, but there's no reason to think it won't be able to build on what it learned with CarPlay. The car represents Apple's final frontier, the only place where we're not as connected as we could be.\n\nAfter all, just look at what the ROKR turned into.",

But the world's richest company is reportedly already pouring resources into what would be its most significant project to date: an electric car.\n\nHundreds of employees at Apple are said to be secretly working on a design for an electric people-carrier, which has been given the code name \"Titan\". So far, the technology firm has declined to comment on the project, but sources close to the company told the Wall Street Journal that it wanted to revolutionise electric cars in the same way that the iPhone shook up the smartphone market.\n\nApple executives have already flown to Austria to meet representatives from the high-end car manufacturer Magna Steyr, and the size of the team involved suggested that the project was a serious proposition, the sources added. Last year the company hired the industrial designer Marc Newson, who built a concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\nThe Titan project - which will almost certainly be dubbed the iCar - was reportedly signed off almost a year ago by Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who has assigned the vice-president of product design, Steve Zadesky, to lead the group. A former Ford engineer, he led the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr Zadesky was given permission to create a 1000-person team to work on the car and cherry-pick employees from different parts of the company, the sources said. Many Apple employees who had been considering leaving the company have been persuaded to stay there to work on Titan.\n\nAn \"automotive research lab\" was reportedly established at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside Apple's main Cupertino campus at the end of last year.\n\nThe company has existing links with the car industry through its dashboard touchscreen system, CarPlay, which is being supported by manufacturers such as Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen.\n\nTHE BIG DRAWBACK\n\nTechnology industry commentators have previously dismissed the idea of an Apple electric car, pointing out that the company does not have its own facility capable of mass car production. \"It's one thing to draw pictures but it's a quantum leap to manufacture things, and Apple doesn't even manufacture,\" one industry insider told the Financial Times.\n\nHowever, building a car plant would not be an obstacle for Apple, which is estimated to hold around $178bn (\u00a3115bn) in cash. If Titan does come to fruition, it could rival the ground-breaking vehicles created by Tesla, the electric car manufacturer owned by PayPal billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nLast week, someone claiming to be an Apple employee emailed the Business Insider website to say that the firm's latest project would \"give Tesla a run for its money\".",

                    "body": "Apple may already have manoeuvred itself into position to evolve into a global car maker in many ways that other Silicon Valley companies have not matched.\n\nBased in Cupertino, California, Apple has put a few hundred employees to work on a secretive project to develop an electric car, a person familiar with the matter has said. While the company often tests ideas that don't get released, the work underscores Apple's long-held desire to play a greater role in the car industry, which is ripe for more convergence with our digital lives.\n\n\"It makes a tonne of sense,\" Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos, said last week. \"If you would have said 10 years ago 'Apple is going to be in the car business' I think people would have said you are crazy - because it would have been crazy. Today it's a much different company that's able to tackle these massive addressable markets.\"\n\nApple, with a market capitalisation that's more than $700 billion, needs to continue growing sales in iPhones, its largest revenue generator, while also expanding into new markets, such as cars, if it's to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Mr Munster said. He added that he did not think that Apple would bring out a car in the next five years.\n\nNonetheless, Apple boasts some advantages over other Silicon Valley companies with car ambitions. Tesla Motors, which delivers less than 10,000 vehicles a quarter, surprised investors last month when chief executive Elon Musk said the firm wouldn't be profitable until 2020.\n\nApple's strengths as a potential maker of cars include:\n\n1. $178 billion\n\nThe car industry churns through cash at an astonishing pace. Apple, as it turns out, has a cash hoard of almost $180bn. As Mr Musk said last week, Apple is \"just running out of ways to spend money\". He added: \"They spend money like it's water over there and they still can't spend enough of it.\"\n\nWhile the old rule of thumb was that it cost about $1bn to develop a new car, those costs are now being spread over more vehicles as traditional car makers work to use vehicle platforms for more models, said Dave Sullivan, an car industry analyst with researchers AutoPacific. That would be one challenge for Apple, as would a lack of experience building cars, though Thilo Koslowski, vice president and car practice leader at Gartner analysts, said they could acquire those manufacturing skills.\n\n\"It's well understood because it has been around for 100 years,\" Mr Koslowski said of building cars. \"What isn't that well understood are the pieces that Apple would potentially bring to the table.\"\n\n2. The Ultimate Mobile Device\n\nApple has built its fortune on creating products that are compellingly designed and that integrate software in such a fashion that immerses users' lives deeper into the Apple world, further hooking them for upgrades. And it already has car-suited technology - mapping software, for instance - ready to go.\n\n\"The car is one of the most important and critical pieces of the puzzle that you need to master if you want to interact with customers wherever they are,\" Mr Koslowski said. \"It's pretty important to have a phone that's connected, and can show you your calendar and do all kinds of other things, but now extending it to this other device that happens to have four wheels.\"\n\n3. Car Guys?\n\nThe car business seems simple to outsiders, tempting some to think they can do better than Detroit, which spent a generation sliding toward bankruptcy reorganisations before re-emerging to new profits.\n\nBut the modern car industry has a mixed record on how outsiders perform. For every Alan Mulally, who jumped from Boeing to oversee Ford's renaissance, there's a Bob Nardelli, the former General Electric executive and Home Depot chief executive, who was at the helm of Chrysler during its bankruptcy. Tesla has so far succeeded while Fisker Automotive, another high-profile electric car company, had its assets sold off in bankruptcy.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has a unique mix of executives with tech and auto experience. The company has long hired engineers from the car sector, often with experience in supply chain management, battery technology and user-interface experience.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, spent 20 years at General Motors in areas of finance and operations. Eddy Cue, the influential senior vice president of internet software, is a car enthusiast and on the board of Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vice president of iPhone product design, who is leading Apple's car effort, spent time working at Ford in his career. Marc Newson, a well-regarded industrial designer who joined Apple's secretive design team last year, worked on a high-profile concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\n4. Retail Network\n\nOne of the strengths, and weaknesses, of traditional car makers has been their dealer networks. It's hard to open up store fronts around the world fast enough to get the scale needed to sell cars. In the United States, there are added complexities such as state franchise laws that often prohibit manufacturers from selling cars directly to customers.\n\nThat's an issue Tesla has sought to change. Rather than selling through franchised dealers, the Palo Alto, California-based car maker operates its own showrooms, which were created by a former Apple executive, and takes orders over the internet. The approach has angered franchise dealers and Tesla had confrontations with dealer groups last year in Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania before reaching compromises.\n\nApple, of course, already has a giant retail network through its hundreds of Apple stores worldwide, from Brazil to Sweden to Turkey.\n\n5. Apple Does Global\n\nThe car business has a global complexity like few other industries, with regulatory, marketing and logistics issues that can trip up the capital-intense business on any given day.\n\nApple, which designs its products in California but depends upon contractors to assemble them, mostly in Asia, is used to managing an on-time supply chain around the world, something Google doesn't do in its day-to-day internet search business, and handling the complexities of currency swings throughout global markets. Chief executive Tim Cook built his reputation at Apple for his ability to navigate those global operations.\n\n\"That would be a huge plus should they decide to manufacture cars,\" said Tim Bajarin, president of technology firm Creative Strategies.\n\nHe said he remains sceptical about whether Apple wants to get into the actual business of selling cars, rather than just moving deeper into creating operating systems for car makers.\n\n\"Doing cars is not in Apple's wheelhouse,\" Mr Bajarin said. \"It's more likely they are trying to create a richer, more immersive electronics experience tied to iOS where not only the audio system but the information and possibly new levels of security through sensors and cameras would be part of what they would offer to other car makers.\"\n\nApple could be creating concepts, or reference designs, to integrate technology to demonstrate to car makers, he said.\n\nbusiness@thenational.ae\n\nFollow The National's Business section on Twitter",

But the world's richest company is reportedly already pouring resources into what would be its most significant project to date: an electric car.\n\nHundreds of employees at Apple are said to be secretly working on a design for an electric people-carrier, which has been given the code name \"Titan\".\n\nSo far, the technology firm has declined to comment on the project, but sources close to the company told the Wall Street Journal it wanted to revolutionise electric cars in the same way that the iPhone shook up the smartphone market.\n\nApple executives have already flown to Austria to meet representatives from the high-end car manufacturer Magna Steyr, and the size of the team involved suggested that the project was a serious proposition, the sources added. Last year the company hired the industrial designer Marc Newson, who built a concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\nThe Titan project - which will almost certainly be dubbed the iCar - was reportedly signed off almost a year ago by Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, who has assigned the vice-president of product design, Steve Zadesky, to lead the group. A former Ford engineer, he led the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.\n\nMr Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team to work on the car and cherry-pick employees from different parts of the company, the sources said. Many Apple employees who had been considering leaving the company have been persuaded to stay there to work on Titan.\n\nAn \"automotive research lab\" was reportedly established at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside Apple's main Cupertino campus at the end of last year.\n\nThe company has existing links with the car industry through its dashboard touchscreen system, CarPlay, which is being supported by manufacturers such as Daimler, Volvo and Volkswagen.\n\nTechnology industry commentators have previously dismissed the idea of an Apple electric car, pointing out that the company does not have its own facility capable of mass automobile production.\n\n\"It's one thing to draw pictures but it's a quantum leap to manufacture things, and Apple doesn't even manufacture,\" one industry insider told the Financial Times.\n\nHowever, building a car plant would not be an obstacle for Apple, which is estimated to hold around $178bn (NZ $238bn) in cash. If Titan does come to fruition, it could rival the ground-breaking vehicles created by Tesla, the electric car manufacturer owned by PayPal billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nLast week, someone claiming to be an Apple employee emailed the Business Insider website to say that the firm's latest project would \"give Tesla a run for its money\".",

And speaking of driverless cars, the report says that the car Apple is working on will be self driving, so it sounds like the project is just as ambitious as one of Google's \"moonshots.\"\n\nReuters' source also says that \"Apple is gathering advice on parts and production methods... adding that Apple appeared not to be interested in combustion engine technology or conventional manufacturing methods.\"\n\nAny Applemobile will likely be an electric car of some kind, especially given Apple CEO Tim Cook's dedication to expanding the use of greener energy.

While Apple often tests ideas that don't get released, the work underscores the company's long-held desire to play a greater role in the automotive space, which is ripe for more of a merging with users' digital lives.\n\n\"It makes a ton of sense,\" Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos., said Saturday in an interview. \"If you would've said 10 years ago, 'Apple is going to be in the car business,' I think people would've said you're crazy -- because it would've been crazy -- and today it's a much different company that's able to tackle these massive addressable markets.\"\n\nApple, with a market capitalization that's more than $700 billion, needs to continue growing sales in iPhones, its largest revenue generator, while also expanding into new markets, such as automobiles, if it's to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Munster said. He added that he doesn't think Apple would bring out a car in the next five years.\n\nNonetheless, Apple boasts some advantages versus other Silicon Valley companies with car ambitions. Tesla Motors Inc., which delivers less than 10,000 vehicles a quarter, surprised investors last month when Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the company wouldn't be profitable until 2020.\n\nApple's strengths as a potential automaker include:\n\n1. $178 Billion\n\nThe automotive industry churns through cash at an astonishing pace. Apple, as it turns out, has a cash hoard of almost $180 billion. As Musk said last week, Apple is \"just running out of ways to spend money. They spend money like it's water over there and they still can't spend enough of it.\"\n\nWhile the old rule of thumb was that it cost about $1 billion to develop a new car, those costs are now being spread over more vehicles as traditional automakers work to use vehicle platforms for more models, said Dave Sullivan, an automotive industry analyst with AutoPacific. That would be one challenge for Apple, as would a lack of experience building cars, though Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner, said they could acquire those manufacturing skills.\n\n\"It's well understood because it has been around for 100 years,\" he said of building cars. \"What isn't that well understood are the pieces that Apple would potentially bring to the table.\"\n\n2. The Ultimate Mobile Device\n\nApple has built its fortune on creating products that are compellingly designed and that integrate software in such a fashion that immerses users' lives deeper into the Apple world, further hooking them for future upgrades. And it already has car-suited technology -- mapping software, for instance -- ready to go.\n\n\"The car is one of the most important and critical pieces of the puzzle that you need to master if you want to interact with customers wherever they are,\" Koslowski said. \"It's pretty important to have a phone that's connected, and can show you your calendar and do all kinds of other things, but now extending it to this other device that happens to have four wheels.\"\n\n3. Car Guys?\n\nThe car business seems simple to outsiders, tempting some to think they can do better than Detroit, which spent a generation sliding toward bankruptcy reorganizations before re- emerging to new profits.\n\nBut the modern automotive industry has a mixed record on how outsiders perform. For every Alan Mulally, who jumped from Boeing Co. to oversee Ford Motor Co.'s renaissance, there's a Bob Nardelli, the former General Electric Co. executive and Home Depot Inc. CEO, who was at the helm of Chrysler during its bankruptcy. Tesla has so far succeeded while Fisker Automotive, another high-profile electric car company, had its assets sold off in bankruptcy.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has a unique mix of executives with tech and auto experience. The company has long hired engineers from the automotive space, often with experience in supply chain management, battery technology and user-interface experience.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, spent 20 years at General Motors in areas of finance and operations. Eddy Cue, the influential senior vice president of Internet software, is a car enthusiast and on the board of Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vice president of iPhone product design, who is leading Apple's car effort, spent time working at Ford earlier in his career. Marc Newson, a well-regarded industrial designer who joined Apple's secretive design team last year, did a high-profile concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\n4. Retail Network\n\nOne of the strengths -- and weaknesses -- of traditional automakers has been their dealer networks. It's hard to open up store fronts around the world fast enough to get the scale needed to sell cars. In the U.S., there are added complexities such as state franchise laws that often prohibit manufacturers from selling cars directly to customers.\n\nThat's something Tesla has sought to upend. Rather than selling through franchised dealers, the Palo Alto, California- based automaker operates its own showrooms -- which were created by a former Apple executive -- and takes orders over the Internet. The approach has drawn the ire of franchise dealers and the automaker has butted heads with dealer groups last year in Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania before reaching compromises.\n\nApple, of course, already has a giant retail network through its hundreds of Apple Stores worldwide, from Brazil to Sweden to Turkey.\n\n5. Apple Does Global\n\nThe automotive business has a global complexity like few other industries, with regulatory, marketing and logistics issues that can trip up the capital-intense business on any given day.\n\nApple, which designs its products in California but depends upon contractors to assemble them mostly in Asia, is used to managing an on-time supply chain around the world -- something Google Inc. doesn't do in its day-to-day Internet search business -- and handling the complexities of currency swings throughout global markets. CEO Tim Cook built his reputation at Apple for his ability to navigate those global operations.\n\n\"That would be a huge plus should they decide to manufacture cars,\" Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, said.\n\nHe said he remains skeptical that Apple wants to get into the actual business of selling cars, rather than just moving deeper into creating operating systems for automakers.\n\n\"Doing cars is not in Apple's wheelhouse,\" Bajarin said. \"It's more likely they are trying to create a richer, more immersive electronics experience tied to iOS where not only the audio system but the information and possibly new levels of security through sensors and cameras would be part of what they would offer to other carmakers.\"\n\nApple could be creating concepts, or reference designs, to integrate technology to demonstrate to automakers, he said.",

If Apple cars were even a \"moderate success,\" Tim Cook and pals could be looking at an extra $50 billion per year in revenues. To put that figure in context, it would be an increase of 23 percent on top of the already impressive cash-generating machine that was Apple in 2015.\n\nMunster's figure is based on an estimate that the U.S. car market is worth $500 billion in sales each year, and an assumption that Apple could conceivably grab 10 percent of that.\n\nQuite correctly, he also notes that even though the Apple Watch isn't out yet, Wall Street types are going to be looking to the next great Apple innovation to continue moving the needle. \"We believe the potential for a car gives investors something, along with the Watch and TV, to look at as the next big thing for Apple,\" Munster writes. \"We believe this hope should be positive for the multiple on shares of AAPL and help support the stock over the next six months.\"\n\nFor now, the Apple car is still very much a rumor -- although there's more and more to suggest it could be more than that. Apple design guru Jony Ive talked about cars in his New Yorker profile, much as Tim Cook hinted that Cupertino was interested in wearables before the Apple Watch was announced. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, claims Cook approved a secret car project more than a year ago, and that Apple is now building a 1,000-person team to take on Tesla Motors.\n\nIn the meantime, here are the qualities we'd love to see if Apple does, in fact, create its own car.

Apple has built an empire with its design prowess and - if it really is the entering electronic vehicle market - the company best known for its smartphones will face an equally design-conscious and well-established competitor in Tesla. Under these circumstances it only makes sense that Apple is pulling out all the stops to build a marketing-busting electric, uh, minivan.\n\nThat's the word on the street, anyway, and by that we mean the Wall Street Journal. Apple is known for keeping product development secrets better than traditionally leaky tech companies, so there is a lot about the vehicle that is a mystery. For one thing, the car is reported to be minivan shaped - there's no confirmation that the vehicle will actually be meant to cart around the little league team. And how likely is a minivan, even a marvel of engineering and design - as any Apple product must be - to carry the codename Titan?\n\nWhat is known is that Apple considered building a car long before it released the first iPhone (while Steve Jobs was at the helm) and it has brought in employees from the auto industry, including Steve Zadesky, who came to Apple by way of Ford more than 15 years ago. More recently, Apple and Tesla have engaged in a small employee-poaching war, in which Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk has claimed victory, telling Bloomberg Businessweek, \"Apple tries very hard to recruit from Tesla.

The Ultimate Mobile Device\n\nApple has built its fortune on creating products that are compellingly designed and that integrate software in such a fashion that immerses users' lives deeper into the Apple world, further hooking them for future upgrades. And it already has car-suited technology -- mapping software, for instance -- ready to go.\n\n\"The car is one of the most important and critical pieces of the puzzle that you need to master if you want to interact with customers wherever they are,\" Koslowski said. \"It's pretty important to have a phone that's connected, and can show you your calendar and do all kinds of other things, but now extending it to this other device that happens to have four wheels.\"\n\n3. Car Guys?\n\nThe car business seems simple to outsiders, tempting some to think they can do better than Detroit, which spent a generation sliding toward bankruptcy reorganizations before re-emerging to new profits.\n\nBut the modern automotive industry has a mixed record on how outsiders perform. For every Alan Mulally, who jumped from Boeing Co. to oversee Ford Motor Co.'s renaissance, there's a Bob Nardelli, the former General Electric Co. executive and Home Depot Inc. CEO, who was at the helm of Chrysler during its bankruptcy. Tesla has so far succeeded while Fisker Automotive, another high-profile electric car company, had its assets sold off in bankruptcy.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has a unique mix of executives with tech and auto experience. The company has long hired engineers from the automotive space, often with experience in supply chain management, battery technology and user-interface experience.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, spent 20 years at General Motors in areas of finance and operations. Eddy Cue, the influential senior vice president of Internet software, is a car enthusiast and on the board of Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vice president of iPhone product design, who is leading Apple's car effort, spent time working at Ford earlier in his career. Marc Newson, a well-regarded industrial designer who joined Apple's secretive design team last year, did a high-profile concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\n4. Retail Network\n\nOne of the strengths -- and weaknesses -- of traditional automakers has been their dealer networks. It's hard to open up store fronts around the world fast enough to get the scale needed to sell cars. In the U.S., there are added complexities such as state franchise laws that often prohibit manufacturers from selling cars directly to customers.\n\nThat's something Tesla has sought to upend. Rather than selling through franchised dealers, the Palo Alto, California-based automaker operates its own showrooms -- which were created by a former Apple executive -- and takes orders over the Internet. The approach has drawn the ire of franchise dealers and the automaker has butted heads with dealer groups last year in Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania before reaching compromises.\n\nApple, of course, already has a giant retail network through its hundreds of Apple Stores worldwide, from Brazil to Sweden to Turkey.\n\n5. Apple Does Global\n\nThe automotive business has a global complexity like few other industries, with regulatory, marketing and logistics issues that can trip up the capital-intense business on any given day.\n\nApple, which designs its products in California but depends upon contractors to assemble them mostly in Asia, is used to managing an on-time supply chain around the world -- something Google Inc. doesn't do in its day-to-day Internet search business -- and handling the complexities of currency swings throughout global markets. CEO Tim Cook built his reputation at Apple for his ability to navigate those global operations.\n\n\"That would be a huge plus should they decide to manufacture cars,\" Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, said.\n\nHe said he remains skeptical that Apple wants to get into the actual business of selling cars, rather than just moving deeper into creating operating systems for automakers.\n\n\"Doing cars is not in Apple's wheelhouse,\" Bajarin said. \"It's more likely they are trying to create a richer, more immersive electronics experience tied to iOS where not only the audio system but the information and possibly new levels of security through sensors and cameras would be part of what they would offer to other carmakers.\"\n\nApple could be creating concepts, or reference designs, to integrate technology to demonstrate to automakers, he said.",

Apple absolutely tries maintaining its top position by bringing on the market new products that are needed, wanted and that make a difference. Electric cars are most definitely an issue that will conquer more and more minds and hearts in the near future. As a consequence, Apple responds with its own variant of this spectacular innovation.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has stated that the work is still in progress and that Apple has put a lot of thought into this majestic project. The name of the electric car is Titan, maybe trying to define its power and healthy energy towards the environment. It resembles to a minivan, so it might easily become a family car or a small business one. The company that takes care of the project is called the Cupertino, and there are several hundreds of employees that try their best in making a whole different concept. Even if the project could not be turned into reality after all, businessmen and representatives from Apple have flown to Austria in order to meet with the manufacturers and review their work until present. Most probably, Apple already has the expertise and any needed resources to produce a car on its own. At present, the company has already released a mapping system since 2012. Furthermore, Apple has created CarPlay, a software program that is used for navigation in auto vehicles that includes iTunes, mapping messaging, and other applications.\n\nPhil Shiller, Apple's senior vice-president of marketing has made a court testimony in 2012, in which he stated that the company has been thinking about producing a car even before the release of the first iPhone, event that happened in 2007. The information has been confirmed by Mickey Drexler, who said that Steve Jobs has been planning for a long time the Apple car.However, Tom Neumayr has infirmed the statement. Actually, the history of the idea doesn't matter much - Apple is always innovative and the result is always the thing that brings evolution - planning is an intermediate that matters, but it doesn't bring much for the customers, and neither does it for the company.\n\nOther companies also work on novelties in what cars are concerned: Google wants to bring on the market the car that works without a driver and Tesla is currently working with more than 150 former Apple employees to bring their new electric car projects to another level.",

                    "body": "Apple is exploring development of its own car, according to multiple reports.\n\nCEO Tim Cook approved development a year ago, according to Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Ramsey at The Wall Street Journal. Steve Zadesky, an Apple VP, has permission to hire 1,000 people to build an electric car.\n\nThis is fairly stunning news.\n\nApple makes high-margin computers that are replaced every 2-5 years. When people buy a car, they can own it for 10 years or more. (Though, leases are changing this, we suppose.)\n\nThe car business is not a great business. Tesla, the only company in the world making an electric car like Apple reportedly plans, reported a $108 million net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nSo, why would Apple do it?\n\nThe best way to figure this out is to look at Cook's quotes. While Apple is largely a secretive company, its executives are refreshing honest, forthright, and thoughtful when they speak in public.\n\nFor instance, in 2013, speaking at the D Conference, Tim Cook was asked about Google Glass. He was largely dismissive of it, but he said, \"I think the wrist is interesting. The wrist is natural.\"\n\nHe then added, \"For something to work here,\" gesturing at his wrist, \"you first have to convince people it's so incredible that they want to wear it.\"\n\nA little over a year later, he revealed the Apple Watch.\n\nAP\n\nSo far, Cook has not said anything we can remember about the automotive industry. Nobody has really asked him since it seemed so far fetched.\n\nIn fact, the closest we may have to Cook alluding to an Apple Car, is when last September he said, \"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about. That haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nHowever, just because he hasn't directly talked about an Apple Car, that doesn't mean he hasn't given hints about why Apple would be interested in doing a car.\n\nThe best way to think about this is to look at what he has to say about the TV industry.\n\nIn December of 2012, Cook was asked about the TV market. He said, \"When I go into my living room and turn on the TV, I feel like I have gone backwards in time by 20 to 30 years. It's an area of intense interest. I can't say more than that.\"\n\nHe reiterated that feeling last September saying, \"TV is one of those things that is stuck back in the 70s. Think about all the things that have changed ...and TV almost feels like you're rewinding the clock, the interface is terrible. It's awful.\"\n\nWhat would happen if you were to replace \"TV\" with \"Cars\" in those quotes? Would what Cook is saying make sense?\n\n\"[A car] is one of those things that is stuck back in the 70s. Think about all the things that have changed ...and [a car] almost feels like you're rewinding the clock, the interface is terrible. It's awful.\"\n\nAnd here's the other quote, changed up.\n\n\"When I go into my [garage] and turn on the [car], I feel like I have gone backwards in time by 20 to 30 years. \"\n\nDo those quotes make sense with car instead of TV in there? Definitely. In some ways, they make even more sense. It's 2015, and our cars are still running on gasoline. At least TV is now delivered through the internet, and there are video apps changing things.\n\nThere's been very little change for the car, a product that people use on a daily basis. It's the perfect target for a visionary company like Apple to attack.\n\nIn 2012, the White House started to increase fuel standards. Here, according to the White House, is what the auto industry was doing on its own:\n\nWhite House\n\nThanks to their poor fuel standards, cars are big polluters. Cook has repeatedly shown an interest in environmental issues.\n\n\"We know, in Apple, that climate change is real. And our view is that the time for talk has passed, and the time for action is now,\" said Cook this week at the Goldman Sachs technology conference.\n\nHe then announced plans to invest $850 million in a solar power plant that will power all of Apple's California operations.\n\nAn electric car would help cut back on pollution. (Yes, some people will say that an electric car will be powered through dirty sources of energy, but that's silly. An electric car can be powered by solar energy. There is no solar-like alternative for fueling a gas-powered car.)\n\nAppleAn Apple solar farm\n\nThen, there's the technology and design aspects of making an electric car.\n\nThe interfaces for dashboards on cars today are a mess. Even Tesla, which is a Silicon Valley company with good design skills, has weak software.\n\nThe interiors on many cars are designed in a haphazard way that makes no sense. There's fake wood here, then silver lines there, then a perforated plastic over there.\n\nFormer Apple board member Mickey Drexler said, \"Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.\"\n\nHe also said that near the end of Jobs' life, they were talking about the Tesla Roadster, Tesla's first car. Jobs thought it was really cool. Drexler, however, was dismissive of the design. He said Jobs set him straight: \"Steve said, you just don't get it. The insides and the engineering of that car are brilliant. Anyone can design a great car, but they have the platform to do it.\"\n\nIt's not just Jobs' that had an active interest in cars.\n\nApple's SVP of internet services, Eddy Cue is on the board of Ferrari, which is getting ready to go public. Cue has been able to get a first hand look at how the high-end auto industry works.\n\nApple's SVP of marketing, Phil Schiller, loves cars. He lists \"cars\" as one of his top interests in his Twitter bio, and for a long time pinned a tweet of a car to the top of his profile.\n\nJony Ive, Apple's head of design, has a fleet of cars including Bentleys and Land Rovers.\n\nSo, clearly there is interest there from Apple.\n\nBut, Apple executives have a lot of interests, including the aforementioned TV market. But, there's a key different between making a car and making a TV.\n\nTo crack the TV market, Apple needs cooperation from programmers, and from cable providers. That's a nasty, knotty market to tackle. If it makes a car, it just makes a car. There is no content partner for Apple to negotiate with. It's just like the Watch, the iPad, and the iPhone. Apple controls the design. It hires manufacturing partners to supply parts.\n\nEventually, someone is going to ask Cook about the auto industry. And he'll probably give a fairly honest answer.",

(Besides, it beats answering any questions involving anyone's \"hairy, scary down thereies\". Mind you, we'll take on all inquiries that begin with the word \"why\" but if we p*ss off the Google Adsense \"gods\" most of you will end up never seeing the response anyway.)\n\nIn case you've not followed the technology news, Apple is rumored to be making car. This past Friday The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple has \"several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle.\"\n\nChristina Warren of Mashable said that \"the Apple car project was approved nearly a year ago by CEO Tim Cook. Yesterday Reuters stated that \"Apple is learning how to make a self-driving electric car and is talking to experts at carmakers and automotive suppliers.\"\n\nWarren believes the \"stories are all speculative . . . unconfirmed and could all ultimately lead to nothing.\" She does admit though that \"as with past rumors about Apple's entry into tablet and wearables, there is simply too much reporting -- and from sources with too strong of a track-record -- to dismiss the idea of an Apple car out of hand.\"\n\nSo whether or not the Apple car ever sees the light of day, let's focus on why they would make a car. As Warren asks: \"(W)hy would a computer company -- computers, large and small and phone-like, is all the company has ever made -- want to be in the automotive business?\"\n\nShe continues: \"One possible answer is a glib one: Just because everyone else in Silicon Valley cares about it.\" Look at Google and Tesla who have already started \"a widespread conversation around the technology of electric, battery-powered cars.\" The SFGate also believes that Apple wants to \"challenge Tesla.\"\n\nThey might be interested in making a car because other companies are looking at this as the \"next big thing.\" It's \"the new hotness.\" As Warren puts it: \"Apple might agree with Google, Tesla and others that the car is a worthy moonshot project.\"\n\nThe idea of making a new car -- especially electric cars is also a good one because of an increase in climate change and a strong memory \"of massive spikes in fuel prices.\"\n\nMaybe they're going for the folks who like the self-driving car concept. Warren confesses: \"As someone who hates to drive, this is a future I can firmly get behind. A self-driving, self-parking car that can drop me off at work or take me to the corner store while I sit back, check my email and play games? Sign me up!\"\n\nAlthough the idea sounds crazy Warren concludes: \"if this really is going to be one of the next big areas of technology's evolution, it would be equally insane for Apple to not be involved in some capacity.\"",

Remember that van we showed you the other day, with the laser mapping contraption on top that turned out to be rented by Apple? Well, it might be a much more taking-on-Tesla project than improving-Apple-Maps-with-Street-View-style-shots endeavor as initially thought. Also, the work might really be on a van of sorts, the sources revealed.\n\nThat mysterious car project is called \"Titan,\" tip insiders, and already has the green light by Apple's CEO Tim Cook to be staffed with a thousand-strong army of engineers, designers, and the like. With this kind of manpower, Titan is definitely not a one-off whim for a few prototypes of something that will be left gathering dust in the basement, as Apple often does, but rather a deliberate push to enter a new market. Of course, Apple has its CarPlay vehicle infotainment ecosystem already set up and ready to go there, too.\n\nSuch a bold move is said to serve a multipronged purpose - expanding Apple's comfort zone into a new and promising field, looking for alternative revenue sources, and preventing the eventual exodus of talent from the company from bright minds who are reluctant to only work on the next iPhone or iPad edition. Hey, those will sell like hotcakes whatever you do with them, after all. It will also (nudge, wink) quell investors' concern that Apple is not pushing for real innovation anymore, what with $180 billion cash hoard and all that.\n\nApple-leased van with laser mapping and navigation equipment on the roof\n\nThe level of people that are tipped to work on Titan is also very telling. We've got Johann Jungwirth, a former chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development, as well as Apple's design VP Steve Zadesky, who is tasked with leading the car project, and is an ex-Ford engineer, too. Also, let's not forget Marc Newson, who Apple recently hired - he is an acclaimed industrial designer who's already done a concept car for that same Ford previously. Add to these that Apple has been poaching engineers from Tesla, as Bloomberg reported recently, and you get the Apple-on-wheels picture.\n\nGoogle self-driving car prototype\n\nBesides the mysterious van which hinted that car-related things are in motion at Apple, the Financial Times reported recently that Apple has people looking up car materials, parts and so on, while another publication was tipped that an upcoming product \"will give Tesla a run for its money.\" If it quacks like a duck, it must be an electric car, cite most people familiar with the matter, but as to what shape and form that might take, remains to be seen, hopefully something better-looking than Google's self-driving bimbo on the right. It will be interesting to watch how Tesla's embattled stock price will open up tomorrow. Queue the Apple car design concepts.\n\nsource: WSJ (paywall), BI, FT & MacObserver",

Only not the flashy electric roadsters like the mean-looking Tesla Model S sedan. Apple seems to be going for something boring. Like a self-driving car that looks like a pill on wheels.\n\nEarly last year, the San Francisco Chronicle speculated that a discreet meeting between Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk and Apple's head of mergers and acquisitions suggested Apple was quite interested in buying Tesla. And Musk did confirm he'd been talking with Apple but didn't reveal what about.\n\n\"We had conversations with Apple,\" Musk said. \"I can't comment whether those revolved around an acquisition.\"\n\nNow who believes that line? Can a genius like Musk forget a big conversation that could have caused him to yield his company to Apple?\n\n\"If there was a scenario where it seemed like it would be more likely that we would be able to create the mass market sort of affordable compelling electric car, then possibly it would make sense to entertain those discussions. But, I don't currently see any scenario that would improve that probability so that's why it's very unlikely.\"\n\nRecent revelations seem to confirm Apple did try to buy Tesla but this bid failed.\n\nA news story in The Wall Street Journal said Apple CEO Tim Cook approved the car project almost a year ago, or right after Apple's attempt to buy Tesla fizzled.\n\nTech experts surmise Musk didn't sell Tesla to Apple or take Apple on as a partner because his vision and Apple's were worlds apart.\n\nEnter Apple's Project Titan, Apple's not so secret attempt to develop a self-driving electric vehicle that resembles a minivan.

                    "body": "Apple has put a few hundred employees to work on a secretive projectto develop an electric automobile, a person familiar with the matter has said. While Apple often tests ideas that don't get released, the work underscores the company's long-held desire to play a greater role in the automotive space, which is ripe for more of a merging with users' digital lives.\n\n\"It makes a ton of sense,\" Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos., said Saturday in an interview. \"If you would've said 10 years ago, 'Apple is going to be in the car business,' I think people would've said you're crazy -- because it would've been crazy -- and today it's a much different company that's able to tackle these massive addressable markets.\"\n\nApple, with a market capitalization that's more than $700 billion, needs to continue growing sales in iPhones, its largest revenue generator, while also expanding into new markets, such as automobiles, if it's to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Munster said.He added that he doesn't think Apple would bring out a car in the next five years.\n\nNonetheless, Apple boasts some advantages versus other Silicon Valley companies with car ambitions.Tesla Motors Inc., which delivers less than 10,000 vehicles a quarter, surprised investors last month when Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the company wouldn't be profitable until 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe automotive industry churns through cash at an astonishing pace. Apple, as it turns out, has a cash hoard of almost $180 billion. As Musk said last week, Apple is \"just running out of ways to spend money. They spend money like it's water over there and they still can't spend enough of it.\"\n\nWhile the old rule of thumb was that it cost about $1 billion to develop a new car, those costs are now being spread over more vehicles as traditional automakers work to use vehicle platforms for more models, said Dave Sullivan, an automotive industry analyst with AutoPacific. That would be one challenge for Apple, as would a lack of experience building cars, though Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner, said they could acquire those manufacturing skills.\n\n\"It's well understood because it has been around for 100 years,\" he said of building cars. \"What isn't that well understood are the pieces that Apple would potentially bring to the table.\"\n\nApple has built its fortune on creating products that are compellingly designed and that integrate software in such a fashion that immerses users' lives deeper into the Apple world, further hooking them for future upgrades. And it already has car-suited technology - mapping software, for instance - ready to go.\n\n\"The car is one of the most important and critical pieces of the puzzle that you need to master if you want to interact with customers wherever they are,\" Koslowski said. \"It's pretty important to have a phone that's connected, and can show you your calendar and do all kinds of other things, but now extending it to this other device that happens to have four wheels.\"\n\nThe car business seems simple to outsiders, tempting some to think they can do better than Detroit, which spent a generation sliding toward bankruptcy reorganisations before re- emerging to new profits.\n\nBut the modern automotive industry has a mixed record on how outsiders perform. For every Alan Mulally, who jumped from Boeing Co. to oversee Ford Motor Co.'s renaissance, there's a Bob Nardelli, the former General Electric Co. executive and Home Depot Inc. CEO, who was at the helm of Chrysler during its bankruptcy. Tesla has so far succeeded while Fisker Automotive, another high-profile electric car company, had its assets sold off in bankruptcy.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has a unique mix of executives with tech and auto experience. The company has long hired engineers from the automotive space, often with experience in supply chain management, battery technology and user-interface experience.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, spent 20 years at General Motors in areas of finance and operations. Eddy Cue, the influential senior vice president of Internet software, is a car enthusiast and on the board of Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vice president of iPhone product design, who is leading Apple's car effort, spent time working at Ford earlier in his career. Marc Newson, a well-regarded industrial designer who joined Apple's secretive design team last year, did a high-profile concept car for Ford in 1999.4. Retail Network\n\nOne of the strengths - and weaknesses - of traditional automakers has been their dealer networks. It's hard to open up store fronts around the world fast enough to get the scale needed to sell cars. In the U.S., there are added complexities such as state franchise laws that often prohibit manufacturers from selling cars directly to customers.\n\nThat's something Tesla has sought to upend. Rather than selling through franchised dealers, the Palo Alto, California- based automaker operates its own showrooms -which were created by a former Apple executive - and takes orders over the Internet. The approach has drawn the ire of franchise dealers and the automaker has butted heads with dealer groups last year in Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania before reaching compromises.\n\nApple, of course, already has a giant retail network through its hundreds of Apple Stores worldwide, from Brazil to Sweden to Turkey.\n\nThe automotive business has a global complexity like few other industries, with regulatory, marketing and logistics issues that can trip up the capital-intense business on any given day.\n\nApple, which designs its products in California but depends upon contractors to assemble them mostly in Asia, is used to managing an on-time supply chain around the world - something Google Inc. doesn't do in its day-to-day Internet search business - and handling the complexities of currency swings throughout global markets. CEO??Tim Cook built his reputation at Apple for his ability to navigate those global operations.\n\n\"That would be a huge plus should they decide to manufacture cars,\" Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, said.\n\nHe said he remains skeptical that Apple wants to get into the actual business of selling cars, rather than just moving deeper into creating operating systems for automakers.\n\n\"Doing cars is not in Apple's wheelhouse,\" Bajarin said. \"It's more likely they are trying to create a richer, more immersive electronics experience tied to iOS where not only the audio system but the information and possibly new levels of security through sensors and cameras would be part of what they would offer to other carmakers.\"\n\nApple could be creating concepts, or reference designs, to integrate technology to demonstrate to automakers, he said.",

Apple is reportedly not too keen on taking much help from carmakers in this project but wants to go solo with the project. What the company is doing however, is taking advice on individual parts and production methods.\n\nAs can be expected, Apple isn't quite keen on the dynamics of the car but is instead looking at the immense revenue potential from the software of the self-driving vehicle and using its services like mapping, car-sharing and recharging services to bring in the cash. Autonomous driving is expected to become big in the future and clearly Apple doesn't want to miss out on the opportunity. Apple's rival Google Inc. has also been actively involved in developing a self-driving vehicle and already has an early prototype ready.\n\nIf the reports are indeed true then it will definitely be quite interesting to see what an electronics giant can do with its first automotive product.

                    "body": "If Apple really is working on a car, what would it look like? And what would we want it to look like and do?\n\nThe growing chorus of rumors about Apple's possible automotive ambitions -- and the hard facts about the car designers it's already recruited -- don't prove Cupertino is working on a car. But if Apple is staffing up to transform the transportation industry, what features might it deliver in its human-transport device?\n\nHead-turning design: This goes without saying. Apple is known for its sleek designs, and the first Apple car should be instantly recognizable -- and endlessly covetable. More than almost any industry aside from fashion, the automobile biz lives and dies on the way its products look. A head-turning car can be a fetish item of the first order -- just ask noted car freak Jony Ive. If Apple's rumored \"Project Titan\" is really all about reimagining the minivan, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, we definitely want one that doesn't look like a mom mobile. Tesla Motors' aesthetic would be a good place to start. Or the Fisker Karma (RIP alas).\n\nBattery life like the iPhone 6 Plus: Everybody likes the idea of an electric car, but nobody wants to run out of juice in the middle of the countryside. Tesla's Model S, with the largest battery available, gets less than 300 miles per charge; that's simply not enough to relieve our anxiety about ending up stranded on the side of the road. We want an electric car with a battery that lasts at least as long as an iPhone 6 Plus, so we can spend a solid day driving without any worries.\n\nSolar panels that charge the car while it's on the road: Apple recently doubled down on its commitment to solar energy for its California campus and retail stores, with Tim Cook saying, \"We know at Apple that climate change is real. Our view is that the time for talk is past and the time for action is now.\" If Cupertino is truly committed to renewable energy, a plug-in electric car isn't enough -- that energy will most likely come from a coal-fired plant. We'll settle for nothing less than beautiful solar panels built into the Apple car's body so it can charge while it rolls down the road.\n\nElectronically tinted windows: We want windows that will block out the blinding sun or shut out pedestrians' prying eyes. This type of technology already exists, but we'll need Apple to perfect it so the perfect mix of visual elegance and supreme privacy is available at the touch of a screen or the utterance of a voice command. Speaking of ...\n\nVoice controls powered by Siri: We expect voice-activated everything in our Apple car. Some of this is already available with CarPlay, Apple's platform for bringing iOS to the car. But Siri's going to need to seriously step up her game to be truly useful when we're on the road. Imagine if the Apple AI could handle complicated requests like, \"Siri, turn down the AC to 69 degrees, tint the front windshield and find me the nearest coffee shop that sells iced coffee.\"\n\nSelf-driving modes: We don't want to cede all our driving privileges to a robotic overlord, but smart self-driving modes seem almost mandatory if Apple is going to push the needle. Self-guiding cars already take the pain out of parallel parking, and the DARPA Grand Challenge has been sending autonomous vehicles into the wild for over a decade. With companies like Google and Tesla pursuing self-driving cars, and Apple rumored to be doing the same, we're excited about the possibility of napping on solo trips to Los Angeles.\n\nAwesome phone audio: One of the few knocks on the original iPhone was its relatively poor audio quality. Apple's made great strides in that department over the years. Now let's see if Tim Cook's army of engineers can fix one of the most annoying parts of using a hands-free phone: garbled audio that's barely conversation-ready.\n\nApple Watch is your key -- and much more: Unlocking your car with your Apple Watch is a no-brainer. But what about starting it remotely? Or even summoning it with a simple voice command spoken into your wrist? Imagine it: \"Siri, pull up to my current location.\" No more struggling to remember where you parked your car or slogging through the rain to retrieve it.\n\nTouch ID to unlock and start your car: Let's say you forgot your Apple Watch. You've always got your fingerprint, and Touch ID should be able to let you into your car -- and fire up the engine.\n\nLightning and USB ports for every seat: Everybody needs their own chargers for all their devices, Apple or otherwise. 'Nuff said.\n\nBiometrics that track your alertness: Any Apple car should work seamlessly with the Apple Watch and iPhone, constantly monitoring the driver's alertness to ensure everybody's safety. Feeling tired or, god forbid, slightly buzzed? Your car can intervene, either shifting into self-driving mode or shutting down automatically.",

Newson - a close friend to Apple's design chief Jony Ive - has previously created a concept car for Ford.\n\nWhen contacted Apple refused to confirm or deny the rumours, but the reports give credence to a statement made by CEO Tim Cook last September when he revealed that \"there are products [Apple] are working on that no one knows about\" and \"that haven't been rumoured about yet\".\n\nWhile other technology firms such as Google are exploring driverless technologies, it is suggested Apple's electric car will instead become a competitor to Tesla - an electric automobile manufacturer founded by billionaire Pay Pal and Space X founder Elon Musk.\n\nTesla's electronic vehicles do not replace drivers with computers to complete the task of driving, but aim instead to enhance the driving experience with technology, while also delivering long-range and energy-efficient battery technology.\n\nApple is known for investing in development work on a wide range of products that it never brings to market, and has filed hundreds of patents for a range of unrealised prototype designs. A car is likely to require significant development time.\n\nLast year, Apple unveiled its first new product line since the iPad - the Apple Watch - following years of speculation about the project. The watch is expected to go on sale in the next couple of months.",

Apple's project, said to be codenamed \"Titan\" seems to have several hundred people working on it, and combines reports of a ex-Ford designer hire, as well as confirmed discussions Apple CEO Tim Cook held a year ago with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nBusiness Insider quotes a tipster's email, claiming that Apple has hired engineers away from Tesla for vehicle development. The recent Apple Hire Marc Newson, confirmed my Newson's LinkedIn profile, designed the 021C Ford concept car, a design called \"Apple-ish\" by analysts.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal claimsthat Apple executives are in the midst of discussions with \"contract manufacturers for high-end cars.\" MacObserver, without giving any specific quotes, cites its own sources confirming the effort.\n\nAll of the reports remind readers that Apple, and other Silicon Valley companies, start development on a product and don't conclude them, for whatever the reason -- Apple's design history is no different. A quick perusal of history suggests that more Apple executives now work for Tesla than the other way around, with Apple trying to stem the tide.\n\nWhile Apple has a solid distribution chain, it would either have to partner with existing dealerships to sell the product or build out its own series of dealerships -- which we see no evidence of at this early stage if a car is even in serious development. At this point, Apple's electric vehicle would have to fight the consumer inertia of the lowest prices for gasoline in over a decade -- a problem that Tesla is having right now, having lost over $300 million in the last year, with little or no profit expected in the next year.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg Business) -- Apple Inc. may already be positioned to evolve into a global automaker in many ways that other Silicon Valley companies aren't.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech company has put a few hundred employees to work on a secretive projectto develop an electric automobile, a person familiar with the matter has said. While Apple often tests ideas that don't get released, the work underscores the company's long-held desire to play a greater role in the automotive space, which is ripe for more of a merging with users' digital lives.\n\n\"It makes a ton of sense,\" Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos., said Saturday in an interview. \"If you would've said 10 years ago, 'Apple is going to be in the car business,' I think people would've said you're crazy -- because it would've been crazy -- and today it's a much different company that's able to tackle these massive addressable markets.\"\n\nApple, with a market capitalization that's more than $700 billion, needs to continue growing sales in iPhones, its largest revenue generator, while also expanding into new markets, such as automobiles, if it's to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Munster said. He added that he doesn't think Apple would bring out a car in the next five years.\n\nNonetheless, Apple boasts some advantages versus other Silicon Valley companies with car ambitions. Tesla Motors Inc., which delivers less than 10,000 vehicles a quarter, surprised investors last month when Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the company wouldn't be profitable until 2020.\n\nApple's strengths as a potential automaker include:\n\n1. $178 Billion\n\nThe automotive industry churns through cash at an astonishing pace. Apple, as it turns out, has a cash hoard of almost $180 billion. As Musk said last week, Apple is \"just running out of ways to spend money. They spend money like it's water over there and they still can't spend enough of it.\"\n\nWhile the old rule of thumb was that it cost about $1 billion to develop a new car, those costs are now being spread over more vehicles as traditional automakers work to use vehicle platforms for more models, said Dave Sullivan, an automotive industry analyst with AutoPacific. That would be one challenge for Apple, as would a lack of experience building cars, though Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner, said they could acquire those manufacturing skills.\n\n\"It's well understood because it has been around for 100 years,\" he said of building cars. \"What isn't that well understood are the pieces that Apple would potentially bring to the table.\"\n\n2. The Ultimate Mobile Device\n\nApple has built its fortune on creating products that are compellingly designed and that integrate software in such a fashion that immerses users' lives deeper into the Apple world, further hooking them for future upgrades. And it already has car-suited technology -- mapping software, for instance -- ready to go.\n\n\"The car is one of the most important and critical pieces of the puzzle that you need to master if you want to interact with customers wherever they are,\" Koslowski said. \"It's pretty important to have a phone that's connected, and can show you your calendar and do all kinds of other things, but now extending it to this other device that happens to have four wheels.\"\n\n3. Car Guys?\n\nThe car business seems simple to outsiders, tempting some to think they can do better than Detroit, which spent a generation sliding toward bankruptcy reorganizations before re- emerging to new profits.\n\nBut the modern automotive industry has a mixed record on how outsiders perform. For every Alan Mulally, who jumped from Boeing Co. to oversee Ford Motor Co.'s renaissance, there's a Bob Nardelli, the former General Electric Co. executive and Home Depot Inc. CEO, who was at the helm of Chrysler during its bankruptcy. Tesla has so far succeeded while Fisker Automotive, another high-profile electric car company, had its assets sold off in bankruptcy.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has a unique mix of executives with tech and auto experience. The company has long hired engineers from the automotive space, often with experience in supply chain management, battery technology and user-interface experience.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, spent 20 years at General Motors in areas of finance and operations. Eddy Cue, the influential senior vice president of Internet software, is a car enthusiast and on the board of Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vice president of iPhone product design, who is leading Apple's car effort, spent time working at Ford earlier in his career. Marc Newson, a well-regarded industrial designer who joined Apple's secretive design team last year, did a high-profile concept car for Ford in 1999.\n\n4. Retail Network\n\nOne of the strengths -- and weaknesses -- of traditional automakers has been their dealer networks. It's hard to open up store fronts around the world fast enough to get the scale needed to sell cars. In the U.S., there are added complexities such as state franchise laws that often prohibit manufacturers from selling cars directly to customers.\n\nThat's something Tesla has sought to upend. Rather than selling through franchised dealers, the Palo Alto, California- based automaker operates its own showrooms -- which were created by a former Apple executive -- and takes orders over the Internet. The approach has drawn the ire of franchise dealers and the automaker has butted heads with dealer groups last year in Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania before reaching compromises.\n\nApple, of course, already has a giant retail network through its hundreds of Apple Stores worldwide, from Brazil to Sweden to Turkey.\n\n5. Apple Does Global\n\nThe automotive business has a global complexity like few other industries, with regulatory, marketing and logistics issues that can trip up the capital-intense business on any given day.\n\nApple, which designs its products in California but depends upon contractors to assemble them mostly in Asia, is used to managing an on-time supply chain around the world -- something Google Inc. doesn't do in its day-to-day Internet search business -- and handling the complexities of currency swings throughout global markets. CEO Tim Cook built his reputation at Apple for his ability to navigate those global operations.\n\n\"That would be a huge plus should they decide to manufacture cars,\" Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, said.\n\nHe said he remains skeptical that Apple wants to get into the actual business of selling cars, rather than just moving deeper into creating operating systems for automakers.\n\n\"Doing cars is not in Apple's wheelhouse,\" Bajarin said. \"It's more likely they are trying to create a richer, more immersive electronics experience tied to iOS where not only the audio system but the information and possibly new levels of security through sensors and cameras would be part of what they would offer to other carmakers.\"\n\nApple could be creating concepts, or reference designs, to integrate technology to demonstrate to automakers, he said.\n\nTo contact the author on this story: Tim Higgins at thiggins21@bloomberg.net To contact the editors on this story: Pui-Wing Tam at ptam13@bloomberg.net Marcus Chan at mchan239@bloomberg.net",

                    "body": "Thirty-one years after he helped oversee the iconic 1984 Macintosh ad, former Apple CEO John Sculley said there's still no one who can match Apple when it comes to marketing -- no matter how much money rivals pour into their campaigns.\n\nSculley was referring to Samsung, who took the smartphone crown thanks in part to its savvy \"Next Big Thing\" marketing campaign, which cemented its status as a credible competitor to Apple. But while Samsung may have a near-ubiquitous presence, it still can't beat Apple's ads when it comes to making consumers feel they have to have a product, said Scully, who's best known as the man who forced Steve Jobs out of Apple.\n\n\"Everybody talks about Apple. Nobody talks about Samsung, or Microsoft, for that matter,\" Sculley said. \"It's hard to be one of these experience brands. Apple was superb about it...To play Apple's game as a direct competitor, which is what Samsung has been doing, is really, really hard.\"\n\nWhile Sculley may be biased, his comments speak to the importance of a strong marketing campaign in the hypercompetitive battle for smartphone customers. Though marketing and a steady improvement in device quality helped Samsung reach the top the mountain, the company has recently lost market share and seen its profits dwindle as it gets squeezed by its rivals.\n\nSamsung spent about 15 percent more on marketing its mobile devices in the US than Apple in the first nine months of 2014, according to the most recent data available from market tracker Kantar Media. But Apple still has managed to grow its market share and outsell Samsung in recent months, while Samsung has struggled to top its previous performance with recent flagship products such as the Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Note 4.\n\nSculley noted that Samsung's industrial design is \"perfectly decent,\" but it hasn't managed to make consumers covet its devices and feel the way they do about their iPhones.\n\nSamsung declined to comment.\n\nThough Sculley has an infamous reputation, he was also known as a marketing genius who served as president of Pepsi-Cola. Since he himself was forced out of Apple in 1993, Sculley has advised and invested in companies, including low-cost handset vendor Obi Mobiles. Sculley even recently published a book, \"Moonshot!,\" to coach companies on how to avoid the fate of companies like BlackBerry.\n\n\"The more successful you are, the more at risk you become of being a victim of that success,\" Sculley said. \"One obvious example is Intel and Microsoft. In the 1990s they dominated personal computers...but both missed mobility.\"\n\nThat remark was part of a broader conversation Sculley had with CNET. Here are some other thoughts from the former Apple CEO:\n\nThe world of 'fashion electronics'\n\nPart of Samsung's problem, Sculley says, is that it's still not thinking of the consumer when it's building products, but instead it includes technology features just because it can. Apple is more thoughtful when creating products, he said, and that's particularly obvious when it comes to wearables.\n\n\"We're in the world now of fashion electronics,\" Sculley said. \"It's much less about the technology, it's about the fashion appeal of the products. I have no idea if Apple Watch is going to be successful or not, but certainly Apple has gone for the high ground with fashion. If a space is there for someone to build a fashion electronics brand for something you wear on the wrist, Apple's got the best shot at it.\"\n\nApple Watch keeps up with the times (pic... See full gallery 1 - 4 / 15 Next Prev\n\nFor Apple, this world represent new ground. Sculley noted that Apple has brought in talented people from the fashion industry. But the question remains about how the company will sell the product.\n\n\"This is where it gets them a little bit into new territory,\" he said. \"I can't tell if it's smart or not.\"\n\nStill, while Sculley owns multiple Macs, iPhones and iPads (including lining up to buy the iPhone 6 Plus while in Dubai), he's not going to be buying the first Apple Watch.\n\n\"For me it's, 'What do I do with it?'\"\n\nTim Cook is the right guy for the job\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook might have a few ideas for Sculley on what to do with Apple Watch, and so far in his tenure as CEO, he's doing all the right things, Sculley said.\n\n\"He's done a lot of really smart things and deserves a lot of credit,\" Sculley said. \"He didn't try to pretend he's going to be the next Steve Jobs, and he didn't try to superimpose his personality onto the products. He has taken Steve's brilliance and Steve's intuitive design and said we can continue to build on the foundations Steve left as his legacy.\"\n\nThis content is rated TV-MA, and is for viewers 18 years or older. Are you of age? Yes No Sorry, you are not old enough to view this content.\n\nPlay\n\nSculley also praised Jony Ive, Apple's head of design, who's been given a lot of control by Cook. And Cook has \"brought in people with great domain experience and things Apple didn't have before,\" such as Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre from Beats. The two joined Apple last year as part of Apple's $3 billion acquisition of the headset and streaming-music business.\n\n\"Apple clearly didn't buy Beats for its technology. It can figure out how to stream on its own,\" Sculley said. \"Cook understood that the relationships Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre had in the industry were more valuable than their technology.\"\n\nUsing Apple's $178 billion cash pile\n\nBeats was a smart acquisition by Apple, Sculley said. And while it was the largest purchase in Apple's 38-year history, it barely made a dent in Apple's cash pile, which totaled $178 billion at the end of 2014.\n\nSee also John Sculley spills the beans on firing Steve Jobs Former Apple CEO John Sculley recalls the Macintosh launch Apple rings up big holiday sales thanks to larger-screen iPhone 6\n\n\"Apple has never had an appetite to buy big companies, especially when I was there,\" Sculley said. \"The board had no interest in considering acquisitions, and there was nothing we missed.\"\n\nAt one point, Apple owned about 18 percent of Adobe and about 5 percent of AOL, Sculley said, and it even helped AOL make payroll. But Apple didn't consider buying them outright, he said. If Apple wanted to make another big acquisition today, PayPal could be a good option, Sculley said.\n\n\"It would certainly be a game changer for the industry, but maybe they don't need it and feel Apple Pay will be successful on its own,\" he said. \"My sense is they don't need to go out and buy another technology company. They need to look at other fields. Why didn't Apple buy Nest Labs instead of Google?\"\n\nIt's a far cry from about 20 years ago, when Apple could have been on the selling block itself. At that time, no one was interested in buying Apple, he said. With a market value of more than $740 billion as of Friday, now no one could afford to.",

As per the Verge and the Wall Street Journal, Project Titan, as it's called by Apple insides, is an all-electric car that will probably look like a minivan in its present version and has a group of a few hundred individuals developing it\n\nThe report alleged that it could take a few years until Titan would be set for production if Apple choses to run the project. The WSJ coverage asserts that Tim Cook approved Titan last year. The company employees have been reported for to have dropped by potential producers to assemble Apple cars. However, there is no certainty that the auto will be out and about.\n\nSo far, Apple has approved the setup of a 1,000-man team with workers from all through the company, the Journal reported. Operating at a private office a couple of miles from Apple's One Infinite Loop grounds in Cupertino, the group is now taking a shot at the outline. Also, on Friday, the Financial Times reported that the high tech business has been interviewing car experts to work in a new facility.\n\nReports around Apple's likely venture into the car business have been out since minivans covered by an X- shaped device were seen riding around the Bay Area at the beginning of this month And one of the vehicles is certainly registered with Apple, KPIX reported.\n\nDespite the fact that the blockbuster dispatch of the iPhone 6 pushed Apple to historical revenues in its latest quarter, the organization must produce an alternate top notch device if that it wants to maintain its development rate.\n\nHowever, few experts are skeptical that Apple will put up an auto of its own for sale. Despite the fact that Apple expanded its iOS to autos with CarPlay a year ago, expert Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research noted that a big part of the vehicle assembling is foreign to Apple. He is doubtful the firm would venture so far from its expertise. Instead, Dawson believes that Apple intends to develop its auto software, maybe helping clients track the execution of their vehicles.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook described last year's launch of CarPlay during a recent tech conference, noting that the organization has likewise discharged a service to help clients monitor their wellbeing and deal with their homes. Cook pleaded for a future of tech integration saying that people would prefer having the same platform for different elements off their lives, like mobiles, home, cars and so on.",

How about the iCar?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple has hired hundreds of people to work on a secret project - code name \"Titan\" - to develop an electric vehicle. The newspaper cites people familiar with the project who spoke under condition of anonymity.\n\nApple spokesman Tom Neumayr declined to comment.\n\nThe article says that the vehicle will resemble a minivan and that it would be branded as an Apple product.\n\nApple's industrial design team is staffed with several people with automaking experience, the article says. That group includes Marc Newson, a designer who once created a concept car for Ford.\n\nApple has confirmed that Newson is on its staff.\n\nIf Apple does sell an electric car, it will face some competitors.\n\nGeneral Motors announced on Thursday that it will build an electric car, the Chevrolet Bolt, with a 200-mile range at a factory near Detroit. The car will cost $37,500, not including a $7,500 federal tax credit, GM said. The car will be built starting in 2017.\n\nSilicon Valley automaker Tesla Motors plans to start selling a 200-mile-per-charge car about the same time. The price of Tesla's Model 3, including the tax credit, is likely to be well below $30,000 after the tax credit.\n\nNissan is already selling an electric car, the Leaf, though not many - 158,000 around the world.\n\nThe Journal notes that Apple is always experimenting with new products, many eventually abandoned. But it says the senior people involved in the electric car project suggest that it is serious venture.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "The very idea is enough to send Apple faithful and fanbois into a frenzy: an iCar! It appears Apple is working on its own electric car project - code-named \"Titan\" - and is intent on giving Tesla \"a run for its money.\"\n\nThere is no doubt about it, cars are the next frontier of tech after smartphones, cloud and tablet computers. Every tech company is labouring to interface with existing car companies, while some - note Google and Apple - are slyly working to reimagine the personal transport of the future.\n\nIn recent weeks evidence emerged that Apple was working on some kind of vehicle experiment as Apple-registered SUVs were spotted in California and New York festooned with cameras and LiDAR sensors, giving rise to speculation it was either working on a Street View mapping exercise for Apple Maps or even a self-driving car.\n\nNow it looks like Apple could be working on an Apple-branded electric vehicle that would compete with Tesla. An even more tantalising vision is an electric self-driving vehicle.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has revealed that Apple has several hundred people working on an Apple-branded electric car.\n\nCode-named \"Titan\" the initial prototype resembles a minivan and the project is being spearheaded by Apple's product design vice president Steve Zadesky, a former Ford executive.\n\nZadesky, it is understood, has been given permission to create a 1,000-strong team and Apple has hired the president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz R&D Johann Jungwirth and other seasoned auto industry execs to work at a top secret automotive research lab.\n\nApple is also believed to be locked in a poaching war with Tesla, one that Tesla is currently winning through 60pc salary increases and US$250,000 bonuses.\n\nTesla is currently riding on a wave of triumph, as orders for its new P85D - which comes with a beguiling new \"insane mode\" - skyrocket and the Elon Musk-headed company builds a gigantic mega factory to keep up with orders. It has even emerged that Musk - often compared to Steve Jobs - is pushing Tesla to create giant batteries to power homes.\n\nBut in moving towards electric cars, does Apple realise what it is taking on?\n\nElon Musk is often compared to Tony Stark, the Iron Man hero, but in reality he's a gutsy entrepreneur with a boundless imagination that involves not only electric vehicles but space exploration and trains that can zoom between mega cities in a matter of minutes.\n\nAs we all know the road to success is littered with failures and Musk in bringing Tesla to where it is today has had more than a few close scrapes.\n\nNear run things include successive last-minute funding rounds and bailouts, re-imagining the idea countless times, problems with drive trains, product recalls, to even laying off 10pc of the Tesla workforce in 2007 to get the project on the right track.\n\nToday the company is bringing in revenues of US$3bn and more but is still operating at a loss. But either way, it is heading in the right direction with quality cars that run on lithium-ion batteries and which are capable of ranges of 320km and capable of top speeds of 249km per hour.\n\nNot only that, but the cars are equipped with the latest in hi-tech gadgetry including radar and sonar technology.\n\nTesla is beginning to dabble in autonomous driving experiences and its Model S can detect road signs, lane markings, obstacles and other vehicles and new vehicles are capable of semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities.\n\nTesla's success has been hard fought, and it is nowhere near its destination.\n\nTraditional car manufacturers like Ford, Audi, BMW, Daimler and Mercedes-Benz are all trying to imagine what the future of transport, indeed car ownership will look like in the decades to come.\n\nEventually, the vision is autonomous driving within just a few short years of now.\n\nA recent conversation with the chief digital officer of Renault Patrick Hoffstetter indicated that car makers know there is an intrinsic link between smart devices and vehicles and the manufacturers are coming up with all kinds of ways of marrying the two, from apps that can unlock and start your car with your phone to cars that allow you to switch between driving and autonomous driving whenever it suits you.\n\n\"We see the car as the sixth screen,\" Hoffstetter said. \"Our vision of the autonomous car is not so much about a car that will drive you through the city, but more about giving you time with your infotainment. You are still driving the car but in some instances you will be able to be autonomous and retrieve your focus from pure driving in order to consume services.\n\n\"We don't talk about autonomous driving the same way most people in the media are talking about it. We believe you should also have the capacity to go back to driving much like an airline pilot or a train driver can enjoy automated functions but switch back to manual at any time.\"\n\nLate last year Google revealed just how advanced autonomous vehicles had become proving vehicles could not only sense other vehicles but also pedestrians possibly about to cross the road.\n\nIt is in discussions with motor giants Ford, Toyota, Daimler, Volkswagen and General Motors to bring self-driving cars to market by 2020.\n\nIn recent weeks, Google revealed its latest autonomous vehicles with built-in intelligence and sensors that take note of pedestrians likely to cross the street, for example.\n\nNot only that but Google is also about to take on Uber at its own game with a ride-sharing app that will actually link with its self-driving cars, so with an app you can summon a robot car to take you to the shops, work or home.\n\nUber is also working on R&D for its own self-driving vehicles and has established a lab in Pittsburgh to build its own fleet of autonomous vehicles. The lab is staffed by 50 scientists from Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute who had a hand in building the Mars Rover.\n\nOne of the mysterious Apple-registered minivans spotted in San Francisco and New York. Photo via Claycord.com\n\nApple has money. Lots of money. Having brought itself back from the brink in 1996 through deftly and correctly guessing the right trends in tech and creating quality products like the iPhone, the company recently recorded the highest profit in business history with profits of US$18bn arising from revenues of US$75bn during which it sold 74.5m iPhones and 21.4m iPad devices.\n\nNot only that but the company is the most valuable on the planet, with a market capitalisation that has just surpassed US$700bn.\n\nThe company has even commenced the construction of a giant US$848m, 130 megawatt solar farm in California that will produce enough energy to power its new spaceship headquarters and all of its retail stores in California, equal to 60,000 homes.\n\nSo what is the next frontier for Apple?\n\nThe very notion of an Apple Car, or an iCar if you will, is a tantalising one. When Apple builds something, it takes its time to get it right. The forthcoming Apple Watch is a case in point and Apple Pay comes at least two to three years on the heels of Google Wallet, for example.\n\nApple's focus on quality industrial design thanks to luminaries like Jony Ive is celebrated.\n\nThe company's unique approach to interface design and user experience is exemplary.\n\nSo an iCar is not totally out of the question, but building one and testing it and eventually bringing a vehicle to market is something that could years and could prove very expensive to accomplish.\n\nBut saying that don't forget Apple dabbled briefly with an alliance with Motorola before going it alone and changing technology history forever in 2007 with the iPhone, despite never having made a phone of its own before and in turn displacing the established computing and mobile phone giants forever. The iPhone was the ultimate disruption.\n\nTherefore Apple has the means, the know-how and the guts to try something truly disruptive with cars.\n\nYou could picture Del Boy and Rodney in one of these - the driverless Lutz 'Pathfinder' Pod which is being tested by the UK government\n\nTo date - with the exception of Tesla - electric cars have lacked style, even substance. Many of them look like golf carts, something Mr Bean wouldn't look out of place in or even that Trotter's Trading three-wheeler from Only Fools and Horses.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles haven't fared much better in the design stakes. Google's self-driving vehicle reminds me of Noddy's wheels while the driverless Lutz 'Pathfinder' Pod is positively poxy looking.\n\nMost of these vehicles are small, two-seater things that for now miss the potential of what autonomous driving could be all about. That's why reading of Apple's use of minivans sparks the imagination a little.\n\nIn the future we may not even own vehicles. Much like today with Uber and Hailo we may just have accounts that we will use to summon vehicles to bring us from A to B.\n\nMost people, freed from the need to propel themselves on long, lone journeys in saloon cars to work, will probably spend more time at home being productive or at leisure with their families.\n\nThey may travel alone if the need requires and a two-seater is fine or they may travel in groups and hence proportionately bigger and safer electrical or autonomous vehicles that can be summoned to carry groups on nights out or take entire families to and from the airport by tapping on a smartphone app would be ideal.\n\nPerhaps Apple has seen this future and is working on a bigger and broader strategy. The Cupertino tech giant could be biting off more than it can chew, or it could be embarking on the journey towards its biggest disruption yet.",

                    "body": "Apple's auto ambitions are shaping up to be far more broad than simply dominating the dashboard with maps and multimedia, with multiple sources tipping an autonomous, electric car project underway dubbed \"Titan\". The Tesla-challenging car would be a cocked-snook not only to the traditional auto industry, it's suggested, but key rivals like Google which are themselves working on self-driving technologies. Reports that Apple had raided top automakers for engineers and R&D specialists broke late last week, for what at the time was speculated as a more advanced version of CarPlay. Now, however, the scope of the rumor-worthy skunkworks seems to be far greater.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook reportedly gave the green-light to the Titan project roughly a year ago, with Vice President Steve Zadesky said to be leading the scheme. Cook signed off on a 1,000 person group, the WSJ reports, with Zadesky - who at one point worked at Ford before joining Apple in 1999, and who worked on mechanical design for numerous projects including iPod and iPhone - given free reign to borrow staff from elsewhere in the firm, as well as from outside.\n\nIn fact, while Apple is apparently happy to poach expertise from the traditional players in the auto industry, according to Reuters' source it's not especially bothered about collaborating with them.\n\n\"The don't appear to want a lot of help from carmarkers,\" the tipster says, suggesting that instead Apple has bypassed the mass market names and gone straight to their own suppliers.\n\nGoogle, which is said to have been rebuffed in its previous attempts to court the automakers, which balked at the level of its demands, is also believed to have approached suppliers independently on self-driving car tech.\n\nThe Apple Titan project is believed to be underway at a location near to, but off-site from, the company's current Cupertino base. There, sources tell the WSJ, research is underway into metals, robotics, and different materials that are all \"consistent with automobile manufacturing.\"\n\nWhile connected cars and electric powertrains are the most concentrated area of focus, it's said, Reuters' source says there's certainly an eye on how vehicles may eventually drive themselves.\n\n\"Fully automated driving is an evolution,\" the unnamed insider points out. \"Carmakers will slowly build the market for autonomous cars by first releasing connected and partially automated cars. Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\"\n\nOf course, Apple is declining to comment on the rumors - a request for more information went unanswered - and there are plenty of get-out clauses in case a fruit-branded car doesn't end up on forecourts. The sort of high-capacity battery technologies an EV would require could be just as instrumental in making longer-lasting MacBooks and iPhones, for instance.\n\nIn fact, there are plenty of ways the company could expand its automotive reach without having to produce an actual car of its own. Software is undoubtedly the key to autonomous vehicles - Ford, for instance, is developing an AI capable of real-time recognition of road signs and markings - and Apple's goal could well be to offer a solution there which other companies might license.\n\nA \"vehicle that resembler a minivan\" is supposedly the current state of the Titan research, potentially the same car spotted in the wild earlier this year with a full array of cameras. At the time, opinion was divided on whether that vehicle was indeed a self-driving prototype, or in fact capturing panoramic street-level photography for use in Apple Maps.\n\nApple would presumably need not only research but prototypes to test out any autonomous car software it was developing, including working with the LIDAR and other sensors involved, even if those prototypes never evolved into Apple-branded vehicles.\n\nDoing so, for instance, would likely demand that Apple move into owning its own factories and production lines, rather than licensing out manufacturing to other companies.\n\nNo matter what Apple Titan is, the fruits of the research are unlikely to be seen for some years, if ever. CarPlay is only now beginning to show up in commercial products, and automakers have proved as cautious about allowing third-parties into their dashboards as regulators have been about the complex legal and insurance environment should autonomous vehicles be allowed to co-exist with human drivers.",

It's all about autonomous driving,\" the source said.\n\nApple may be pursing mainly expertise rather than full-scale partnerships, a pattern that has a long history.\n\nIn 2005, two years before it released the iPhone, Apple worked with Motorola, then the world's second-largest mobile phone maker, to develop the Rokr, a phone with integrated iTunes music and media-playing features. Capable of only holding 100 songs, the phone flopped, and briefly called into question Apple's ability to break into new product categories.\n\nMore recently, in developing the soon-to-be-launched Apple Watch, the company held limited talks with Swiss watchmakers, but no broad-based alliance emerged from the discussions.\n\nInstead of partnerships, Apple pursued a go-it-alone strategy and turned to poaching talent from top watchmaking brands.\n\nAmong the high-profile hirings Apple has made from the auto industry was Johann Jungwirth, President & CEO, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America. Jungwirth could not be reached for comment.\n\nA spokesman for Daimler on Saturday said that the team of engineers which developed the Mercedes-Benz autonomous car remains intact and that Jungwirth was mainly specialized in integrating smartphone functionality and developing advanced user experiences.\n\nAccording to Jungwirth's Linkedin profile he joined Apple in September. At Daimler his responsibilities from March 2009 to September 2014 included overseeing Connected Car & UI Telematics, Autonomous Driving, Advanced User Experience Design, Powertrain & eDrive, Advanced Exterior Design and Mercedes Benz style, group research and regulatory affairs, the profile said.",

So it's perhaps little surprise that after successfully tackling personal computers, smartphones and watches, the buzz in some tech circles is that Apple has set its sights on building a car.\n\nWhile the idea may seem far-fetched - Apple CEO Tim Cook need only chat up Tesla founder Elon Musk to learn about the rough roads facing the upstart automotive manufacturer - a number of speculative reports suggest it's a possibility.\n\nThe Silicon Valley powerhouse is secretly hiring experts with auto backgrounds in an effort that would meet autonomous-car-crazed Google head on.\n\nThe most high profile Apple hire associated with the theory is Johann Jungwirth, formerly the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research and development division, according to a report in the Financial Times. The British newspaper's Friday report, citing unnamed sources, adds that top Apple executives including design guru Jony Ive have been meeting in a secret off-campus lab to discuss an automotive project.\n\nWhile such a venture could be focused on expanding the performance of the company's existing CarPlay technology - which syncs many features in an iPhone to a vehicle's infotainment system - \"I think it's (to build) a car,\" said the FT's source.\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report Friday, also citing unnamed sources, Apple has several hundred employees working on a project code-named Titan, which may be focused on a battery-powered minivan. If this were true, going from idea stage to Apple Cars on the road would require years of testing and regulatory hurdles.\n\nNonetheless, earlier this month Business Insider reported that an Apple employee emailed the publication saying simply, \"Apple's latest project is too exciting to pass up. I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.\"\n\nBryan Chaffin, founder of the Apple-focused site The Mac Insider, reported that \"a lot of people at the top in Silicon Valley consider it a given that Apple is working on a car.\"\n\nApple declined to comment.\n\nThe Cupertino company's crosstown tech rivals Google have been hard at work for years on a self-driving car. That mission inched closer to reality last month, when its gear-laden autonomous Lexus RX models were replaced by small white pods that look plucked from a science fiction comic book.\n\nGoogle may also be getting into the ride-hailing game along with Uber, suggesting that it may want to develop a network of pods linked together by an app.\n\nWhatever the truth of these Apple rumors, there's no denying the increasingly intertwined nature of the technology and automotive worlds. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, 10 car manufacturers dominated an entire hall.\n\nOne prominent CES attendee, Ford, recently opened a new Silicon Valley campus with a mission to ramp up staffing from 20 to 125 by year's end. The man they hired to head their newly expanded operation, Dragos Maciuca, is a former Apple engineer who previously had worked at BMW's Silicon Valley R&D lab.\n\nFord CEO Mark Fields made it clear at the new lab's unveiling that a lot of the work being done will focus on \"what transportation looks like in the future.\" That's a future Apple clearly wants to be a part of one way or the other, even if the current scuttlebutt proves to be hyperbole.\n\n\"The automotive industry is changing quickly because of technological advances, government regulations and even consumer preference, (which) is making it more challenging for the established players to retain dominance, while simultaneously creating opportunities for new companies,\" says Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.\n\n\"Automotive design and assembly remains a demanding and expensive foray, certainly one not to be entered lightly,\" he says. \"But the money flowing into the technology sector suggests a new car could emerge from this industry, with tech titans like Apple and Google being the most obvious candidates.\"\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.13wmaz.com/story/tech/2015/02/14/get-ready-for-the-apple-car-reports-say/23416133/",

This is to be seen since it appears to be connected with mysterious van sightings in Palo Alto.\n\nA mysterious van with cameras mounted on its roof was spotted in the Palo Alto region of California recently. This may have implications for the Apple electric car. As rumor has it, the van is being used to perform experiments in order to pave the way for Apple's electric car.\n\nYet there are also other voices in the wilderness. They say that the purpose of the mystery van is to chart out the surrounding regions for building Apple Maps. But it seems the electric car is still an initiative that is alive and well.\n\nMacRumors has posted the video footage of the mysterious Apple van driving past Juana Briones Park on Clemo Avenue which is a residential side street and it is located approximately 10 miles away from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino. Watch the video clip below.\n\nApple has obtained the services of many experts on automobiles regarding its top secret project. There is even talk of a self-driving vehicle somewhere in the works. Seeing the fact that other companies such as Google and Tesla are already engaged at a breakneck pace in alternative vehicles, Apple is not a company to be left behind. It has already made plans to increase its repertoire of products.\n\nApple's electric vehicle is meanwhile at the forefront of its schemata. The patent for the car has already been filed. It involves the use of computers in a car. Thus it is more of an electronic work station than a vehicle.\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is that within the next generation or so, there will be a 50% increase in the electronic and silicon-based components in vehicles whether they come from Tesla or Google or Apple.\n\nApple on the other hand has a style of not letting the public know about its pet projects up until the last moment. This silence and hushed-up attitude is something for which it has become especially famous.\n\nApple's notoriety for keeping things under wraps has provoked the nosey nature of the media to go into hyper drive. There are however no comments from Apple this time around too.\n\nThe Apple Watch is another component that is in the supply line. It will require the utmost confidence and care to make it functional and fit for public usage. As for the electric car or Apple Maps deal, maybe Apple is trying to kill two birds with one stone via its mystery van.\n\nThe sensors in the van might help out in devising new electronic interiors for the electric car and they may also help map the surrounding environs. Thus Apple may be playing out a dual policy with its strange vehicle in a strange land.",

                    "body": "Apple is exploring development of its own car, according to multiple reports.\n\nCEO Tim Cook approved development a year ago, according to Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Ramsey at The Wall Street Journal. Steve Zadesky, an Apple VP, has permission to hire 1,000 people to build an electric car.\n\nThis is fairly stunning news.\n\nApple makes high-margin computers that are replaced every 2-5 years. When people buy a car, they can own it for 10 years or more. (Though, leases are changing this, we suppose.)\n\nThe car business is not a great business. Tesla, the only company in the world making an electric car like Apple reportedly plans, reported a $US108 million net loss for the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nSo, why would Apple do it?\n\nThe best way to figure this out is to look at Cook's quotes. While Apple is largely a secretive company, its executives are refreshing honest, forthright, and thoughtful when they speak in public.\n\nFor instance, in 2013, speaking at the D Conference, Tim Cook was asked about Google Glass. He was largely dismissive of it, but he said, \"I think the wrist is interesting. The wrist is natural.\"\n\nHe then added, \"For something to work here,\" gesturing at his wrist, \"you first have to convince people it's so incredible that they want to wear it.\"\n\nA little over a year later, he revealed the Apple Watch.\n\nSo far, Cook has not said anything we can remember about the automotive industry. Nobody has really asked him since it seemed so far fetched.\n\nIn fact, the closest we may have to Cook alluding to an Apple Car, is when last September he said, \"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about. That haven't been rumoured about yet.\"\n\nHowever, just because he hasn't directly talked about an Apple Car, that doesn't mean he hasn't given hints about why Apple would be interested in doing a car.\n\nThe best way to think about this is to look at what he has to say about the TV industry.\n\nIn December of 2012, Cook was asked about the TV market. He said, \"When I go into my living room and turn on the TV, I feel like I have gone backwards in time by 20 to 30 years. It's an area of intense interest. I can't say more than that.\"\n\nHe reiterated that feeling last September saying, \"TV is one of those things that is stuck back in the 70s. Think about all the things that have changed ...and TV almost feels like you're rewinding the clock, the interface is terrible. It's awful.\"\n\nWhat would happen if you were to replace \"TV\" with \"Cars\" in those quotes? Would what Cook is saying make sense?\n\n\"[A car] is one of those things that is stuck back in the 70s. Think about all the things that have changed ...and [a car] almost feels like you're rewinding the clock, the interface is terrible. It's awful.\"\n\nAnd here's the other quote, changed up.\n\n\"When I go into my [garage] and turn on the [car], I feel like I have gone backwards in time by 20 to 30 years. \"\n\nDo those quotes make sense with car instead of TV in there? Definitely. In some ways, they make even more sense. It's 2015, and our cars are still running on gasoline. At least TV is now delivered through the internet, and there are video apps changing things.\n\nThere's been very little change for the car, a product that people use on a daily basis. It's the perfect target for a visionary company like Apple to attack.\n\nIn 2012, the White House started to increase fuel standards. Here, according to the White House, is what the auto industry was doing on its own:\n\nThanks to their poor fuel standards, cars are big polluters. Cook has repeatedly shown an interest in environmental issues.\n\n\"We know, in Apple, that climate change is real. And our view is that the time for talk has passed, and the time for action is now,\" said Cook this week at the Goldman Sachs technology conference.\n\nHe then announced plans to invest $US850 million in a solar power plant that will power all of Apple's California operations.\n\nAn electric car would help cut back on pollution. (Yes, some people will say that an electric car will be powered through dirty sources of energy, but that's silly. An electric car can be powered by solar energy. There is no solar-like alternative for fueling a gas-powered car.)\n\nThen, there's the technology and design aspects of making an electric car.\n\nThe interfaces for dashboards on cars today are a mess. Even Tesla, which is a Silicon Valley company with good design skills, has weak software.\n\nThe interiors on many cars are designed in a haphazard way that makes no sense. There's fake wood here, then silver lines there, then a perforated plastic over there.\n\nFormer Apple board member Mickey Drexler said, \"Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.\"\n\nHe also said that near the end of Jobs' life, they were talking about the Tesla Roadster, Tesla's first car. Jobs thought it was really cool. Drexler, however, was dismissive of the design. He said Jobs set him straight: \"Steve said, you just don't get it. The insides and the engineering of that car are brilliant. Anyone can design a great car, but they have the platform to do it.\"\n\nAt 1 hour, 17 minutes he talks about it:\n\nIt's not just Jobs' that had an active interest in cars.\n\nApple's SVP of internet services, Eddy Cue is on the board of Ferrari, which is getting ready to go public. Cue has been able to get a first hand look at how the high-end auto industry works.\n\nApple's SVP of marketing, Phil Schiller, loves cars. He lists \"cars\" as one of his top interests in his Twitter bio, and for a long time pinned a tweet of a car to the top of his profile.\n\nJony Ive, Apple's head of design, has a fleet of cars including Bentleys and Land Rovers.\n\nSo, clearly there is interest there from Apple.\n\nEventually, someone is going to ask Cook about the auto industry. And he'll probably give a fairly honest answer.\n\nUntil then, this is our best guess: He thinks cars are still stuck in the past, and Apple has an opportunity to change the world for the better by making an electric car.",

There are already hundreds of employees dedicated to the clandestine project, code-named \"Titan.\" That name, of course, will inevitably have to change, as it's owned by Nissan.\n\nThe project to build an Apple-branded electric vehicle is the result of CEO Tim Cook's approval nearly a year ago, according to The Wall Street Journal. Product design vice president and former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky was given the green light to hire a 1,000-person team from outside and inside the company. The hope is to build the equivalent of the iPhone for the electric vehicle market.\n\n\"Working from a private location a few miles from Apple's corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing,\" according to the WSJ, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAdditionally, Apple executives have reportedly met with Austria-based contract manufacturers for high-end cars. The company's industrial design team also includes former employees of European automakers, according to the WSJ.\n\nThe cost of manufacturing cars is titanic (pun intended), but flush with $178 billion in cash at the end of 2014, Apple seems capable of entering the game.\n\nWhile Apple's interest in building an electric car is serious, the ultimate result of Titan may not be a market-ready car. The research and development of electric car batteries and in-car electronics could be leveraged to improve Apple's other products, according to the WSJ. Benefits for Apple's CarPlay, the vehicle-friendly version of iOS, also seem likely.\n\nEarlier this month, there was a sighting of an Apple-leased minivan topped by numerous cameras in the Bay Area. A technology analyst said the minivan was equipped with too many cameras to make it a mapping car. Rather, he guessed it was a test for a self-driving vehicle. However, Apple is not one of the six companies owning the necessary permit to test a self-driving car.\n\nFor now, Apple has no plans to follow Google and Uber into the realm of self-driving cars, according to the WSJ report.",

Though Apple does not currently have a licence to test such vehicles themselves, it could be partnering with a manufacturer who does.\n\nIt comes at a time when autonomous cars are increasingly in the news. Last week the Department of Transport unveiled the first driverless vehicles that will be trialled on the streets of the UK, including a single-seater pod and a multi-person transporter that will both work on footpaths in cities across the UK. Bristol and Milton Keynes are among those taking part.\n\nInterestingly, Apple's head of design Jony Ive just so happened to be profiled in the New Yorker recently, and was noted as something of a car enthusiast, but criticised current car designs. \"There are some shocking cars on the road\", he said. \"One person's car is another person's scenery.\"\n\nSome might say it's handy for Apple that their design chief is a petrolhead.\n\nThese latest reports also come after the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Apple had set up a secret lab code-named Titan that was working on an electric car. Although Apple has declined to comment on any of the rumours, a mountain of speculation is building not too dissimilar to the frenzy surrounding the rumoured 'iWatch'. Apple of course then unveiled the Apple Watch in September.\n\nThe Cupertino-based firm has already dipped its toe in the car-tech market with Apple CarPlay, software that enables drivers to put useful iPhone functionality onto a special dashboard in selected car models for safer hands-free driving. It enables drivers to use Maps for directions, as well as Siri and play music stored on their iPhone too. Most of the world's leading car brands, among them the likes of BMW, Citroen, Nissan, Honda and Ford, have already signed up.\n\nCalifornia's Silicon Valley is quickly becoming inundated with futuristic car technology. Google is currently testing out its own autonomous on the streets of Mountain View, where the company has its headquarters. Tesla too has a driverless car, while the big car manufacturers, though not based in California, are also queuing up to show off their own take on the subject.\n\nMercedes had a very Minority Report-like concept car at International CES - the technology trade show - in January, and BMW, Audi and Tesla had their driverless technology on show too.\n\n2015 looks like the start of the driverless age, so it wouldn't be too much of a surprise to see Apple join in at some point in the future.",

It was printed just hours after a Financial Times article revealed that Apple was hiring automotive experts for a top-secret project.\n\nOf course, as the Journal points out, there is no guarantee that an Apple-branded electric vehicle will ever hit the roads. The company is known for investigating different types of technology and various potential products that never make it beyond the prototype stage. Also, even if they are serious, it would be years before the car is finished and passes safety certifications.\n\nHowever, the size of the project team and the senior executives rumored to be involved suggest that this is a serious effort on the company's part, the sources said. Top Apple brass have flown to Austria for meetings with auto parts supplier Magna Steyr, a division of Magna International that focuses on high-end vehicles. The company declined the Journal's request for comment.\n\nBringing in the big guns\n\nMashable added that Apple has apparently tapped executive and former Ford Motor Company engineer Steve Zadesky to head up the group, and that he has been overseeing the project for nearly a year. They have also hired Johann Jungwirth, former head of R&D at Mercedes Benz North America, and several members of the team previous worked with European automakers. Forty-six team members are former Tesla employees.\n\nThe Journal said that an unnamed source familiar with Apple's body of work told them that the company was looking to put its imprint on the electric vehicle market in much the same way that they did with the iPhone on the smartphone market. While the company has thus far managed to keep its growth from slowing, it may be under pressure to deliver the next big thing.\n\nOne added bonus to the project, one source told the WSJ, is that many Apple employees who were planning to leave the company have decided to stay and work on the new project instead. The experimental new car has been a good break from the pressures of annually churning out new versions of Apple's existing product line, that individual explained.\n\nThe Verge also points out that the project could also turn out to be a platform for testing other types of products and technology that the company is working on, citing its CarPlay service as an example. CarPlay is a service that allows drivers to access Apple services such as Siri and iTunes music through dashboard information systems, and more than two dozen car makers have said that they plan to use it, according to reports.",

Well, it seems like the most recent reports indicate that this wasn't Apple's plan! Instead, the company is building an electric car!\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal has reported recently, it seems like Apple has hired a couple of hundred employees, some from Tesla, as an effort to create an electric car, also known by its name of Project Titan.\n\nBased on the reports, it seems like Apple's CEO, Tim Cook actually approved the project around an year ago and placed the product design vice president, Steve Zadesky in charge of the entire project. However, the renderings which we have so far do not make this car a marvel in terms of design, as it looks somewhat like a minivan. Many people have begun wondering what Apple had in mind when they decided to build it in the form of a minivan. However, the large number of employees who are currently working on this project prove that the company is actually serious about it and that they will probably try entering the car industry sooner than anyone has expected so far.\n\nHowever, until Apple gives out a confirmation on whether this is true or not, project Titan remains a simple rumour which we may never actually get to see in person. However, it wouldn't really make sense to invest a large amount of money and get a team of a couple of hundreds or even a thousand employees working on a project that has no chances of hitting the streets at a point in time.\n\nBased on everything that has been outlined so far, together with the rumours sparking up last week when we discussed about the cards that had a weird technological system on top of them, it seems like this is something that we're going to hear about a lot more in the future! I'm also wondering whether Project Titan will be a simple electric car or actually become a driveless model, further promoting what Google has bene trying to build for a couple of years until now.\n\nWhat do you think about the Apple Car? Is this something that you'd like to hear more about? Do you think that Apple is completely serious about the project? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.",

Baker of the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Apple's head of M&A met with Elon Musk.\n\nThey wrote, \"such a high-level meeting between the two Silicon Valley giants involving their top dealmakers suggests Apple was very much interested in buying the electric car pioneer.\"\n\nElon Musk went on to confirm that he had been talking with Apple.\n\n\"We had conversations with Apple,\" he told Bloomberg's Betty Liu.\"I can't comment whether those revolved around an acquisition.\"\n\nMusk does not deny that there may have been talks. Instead he deflects, and says, \"If there was a scenario where it seemed like it would be more likely that we would be able to create the mass market sort of affordable compelling electric car, then possibly it would make sense to entertain those discussions. But, I don't currently see any scenario that would improve that probability so that's why it's very unlikely.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Apple CEO \"approved the car project almost a year ago,\" which is right when Apple was meeting with Tesla.\n\nThis is just speculation on our part, but it seems like Apple met with Tesla about a potential acquisition, or partnership. But, Musk may not have wanted to sell to Apple because his vision was not aligned with Apple's vision. Or maybe he didn't think Apple could bring much to the table.",

The head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley R&D unit has apparently become one of Apple's latest recruits, the inside sources reckon.\n\nAs we've previously reported, Apple has also won over staff from Tesla, with some engineers defecting, as even CEO of Tesla Elon Musk admits - with Cupertino offering massive salary increases to tempt folks.\n\nWhat's really striking, though, is that the FT report claims this isn't about CarPlay or in-car dashboard technology in general, but that Apple could be working on, or at least looking into, the possibility of its own car.\n\nOne source who has worked with Apple for a number of years told the FT: \"Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay. Today I think it's a car.\"\n\nAn alleged email from an Apple staff member said that Apple's latest project would give Tesla a \"run for its money\".\n\nOthers have predictably poured cold water on that idea. Manufacturing gadgets is one thing - but building and producing your own vehicle is another completely. That said, the profit margin Apple would be able to command might well be tempting...\n\nIf there is indeed a car in the works, it will be a long way down the line, mind you. The car, along with the smart home, are sectors Apple is looking to make a major impact in for the long-term.\n\nThe company certainly has plenty of cash to fuel experiments in whatever it fancies, particularly given the amount of dough the latest iPhones are raking in. Cupertino's big pile of cash is the reason why it can afford to offer such attractive salaries in terms of poaching...",

It's all about autonomous driving,\" the source said.\n\nApple may be pursing mainly expertise rather than full-scale partnerships, a pattern that has a long history.\n\nIn 2005, two years before it released the iPhone, Apple worked with Motorola, then the world's second-largest mobile phone maker, to develop the Rokr, a phone with integrated iTunes music and media-playing features. Capable of only holding 100 songs, the phone flopped, and briefly called into question Apple's ability to break into new product categories.\n\nMore recently, in developing the soon-to-be-launched Apple Watch, the company held limited talks with Swiss watchmakers, but no broad-based alliance emerged from the discussions.\n\nInstead of partnerships, Apple pursued a go-it-alone strategy and turned to poaching talent from top watchmaking brands.\n\nAmong the high-profile hirings Apple has made from the auto industry was Johann Jungwirth, President & CEO, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America. Jungwirth could not be reached for comment.\n\nA spokesman for Daimler on Saturday said that the team of engineers which developed the Mercedes-Benz autonomous car remains intact and that Jungwirth was mainly specialized in integrating smartphone functionality and developing advanced user experiences.\n\nAccording to Jungwirth's Linkedin profile he joined Apple in September.

The research is currently in progress at a secret lab in Silicon Valley and Apple declined to comment on the reports.\n\nAccording to Financial Times, the company had set up the lab soon after the launch of iPhones and the Apple Watch. The project was rumored to be named \"Titan\" that included several hundreds of researchers and the lab was located close to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. The company is likely to offer the contract to contract car makers Magna International as executives have visited one of their unit called Magna Steyr.\n\nApple would make its entry into the automobile market if it succeeds in developing a self-driving electric car though its main focus would remain on mobile and other devices.

While Apple often tests ideas that don't get released, the work underscores the company's long-held desire to play a greater role in the automotive space, which is ripe for more of a merging with users' digital lives.\n\n\"It makes a ton of sense,\" Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Cos., said Saturday. \"If you would've said 10 years ago, 'Apple is going to be in the car business,' I think people would've said you're crazy - because it would've been crazy - and today it's a much different company that's able to tackle these massive addressable markets.\"\n\nApple, with a market capitalization that's more than $700 billion, needs to continue growing sales in iPhones, its largest revenue generator, while also expanding into new markets, such as automobiles, if it's to reach a $1 trillion valuation, Munster said. He added that he doesn't think Apple would bring out a car in the next five years.\n\nNonetheless, Apple boasts some advantages versus other Silicon Valley companies with car ambitions. Tesla Motors Inc., which delivers less than 10,000 vehicles a quarter, surprised investors last month when Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the company wouldn't be profitable until 2020.\n\nThe automotive industry churns through cash at an astonishing pace. Apple, as it turns out, has a cash hoard of almost $180 billion. As Musk said last week, Apple is \"just running out of ways to spend money. They spend money like it's water over there and they still can't spend enough of it.\"\n\nWhile the old rule of thumb was that it cost about $1 billion to develop a new car, those costs are now being spread over more vehicles as traditional automakers work to use vehicle platforms for more models, said Dave Sullivan, an automotive industry analyst with AutoPacific. That would be one challenge for Apple, as would a lack of experience building cars, though Thilo Koslowski, vice president and automotive practice leader at Gartner, said they could acquire those manufacturing skills.\n\n\"It's well understood because it has been around for 100 years,\" he said of building cars. \"What isn't that well understood are the pieces that Apple would potentially bring to the table.\"\n\nApple has built its fortune on creating products that are compellingly designed and that integrate software in such a fashion that immerses users' lives deeper into the Apple world, further hooking them for future upgrades. And it already has car-suited technology ready to go.\n\n\"The car is one of the most important and critical pieces of the puzzle that you need to master if you want to interact with customers wherever they are,\" Koslowski said. \"It's pretty important to have a phone that's connected, and can show you your calendar and do all kinds of other things, but now extending it to this other device that happens to have four wheels.\"\n\nBloomberg",

That's the plan at least. In addition to a car, though, Reuters reports Apple is putting resources into creating a software platform that will run inside the cars of tomorrow.\n\nSources close to Apple's plans claim the company is less focused on manufacturing cars -- a la Tesla -- and more focused on developing a platform designed to one-up other high-profile car projects. Many big automakers are investigating the merits of autonomous cars, while Google is developing its own technology to tackle the utopian self-driving dream.\n\n\"It's a software game,\" Reuters said. \"It's all about autonomous driving.\"\n\nApple has reportedly enlisted a ton of folks with experience in the automotive industry, with sources saying the project is a once in a lifetime opportunity. In typical Apple style, the company is casually seeking advice from experts, but has decided to largely go at it alone. Yesterday's report from the WSJ said Apple has appointed former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky to lead the project.\n\nOne thing in particular Apple has identified in regards to software, according to Reuters, are the services usually associated with self-driving technology, including high-definition mapping, car-sharing, and electric car recharging services. So basically an entire ecosystem for your car, pretty much in line what we have for phones, TVs, computers, etc.\n\nThe world of self-driving technology is still a distant promise, but many companies have taken major steps toward making it a reality. It sounds like Apple doesn't want to miss out on the opportunity to explore its own solution. Whether that'll entail a full-blown minivan, or even an entire fleet of cars, remains to be seen.",

                    "body": "Earlier this month CBS news affiliate KPIX 5 in Concord, California reported on a Dodge Caravan they confirmed was leased to Apple. The Caravan itself wasn't the news however. It was what was on top: a roof-mounted system of what appeared to be cameras, motion sensors, or both. Local blog Claycord then posted photos of the Caravan and the Internet exploded. Could this be the fabled iCar Apple fans have wanted since they started throwing \"i\" in front of every product?\n\nAt first doubts we cast that this was proof that Apple is developing any kind of iCar. Many pointed to the structure on the top, which they said appears to have 12 cameras, and said that was evidence this vehicle was more likely a mapping vehicle like the kind Google uses to capture Street View images. Street View, of course, is a part of Google Maps that allow users to virtually walk down a street and see photos of what it actually looks like. Street View is one of the main (though there are several) advantages Google Maps has over Apple Maps. Though Apple Maps do offer Flyover--a feature that renders cities in 3D--it lacks the specificity of being able to see street level store fronts.\n\nApple Maps has long been lambasted for its lack of accuracy and their sparse features, so it would make sense that Apple would be looking to add a Street View-like feature into the mix. In order to do so, they would need to get their own cars fitted with cameras and literally drive them up and down streets capturing images. And from quick glance, the apparatus on top of this Dodge Caravan appears to be able to do just that.\n\nBut the theory that this vehicle was a mapping vehicle quickly came up against resistance when the blog that posted the original photos soon noted that Apple's Caravan looked similar to a self-driving Dodge Caravan seen in New York in 2014. On that Caravan was the same apparatus and it was noted that the cameras on that apparatus and the cameras on Apple's Caravan appeared to be pointing down at the corners of the vehicle, not outwards as they would on a vehicle that was capturing street-level images.\n\nCould these \"cameras\" not just be cameras, but also motion and spatial sensing equipment found in self-driving cars? And if that's the case, could Apple actually be working on a self-driving vehicle?\n\n\"Hundreds of people at Apple are said to be secretly working on a design for an electric people-carrier which has been given the code name Titan. So far, the technology firm has declined to comment on the project, but sources close to the company told the Wall Street Journal it wanted to revolutionise electric cars in the same way that the iPhone shook up the smartphone market,\" reports The Independent.\n\nAn automotive research lab was reportedly established at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside Apple's main Cupertino campus at the end of last year - suggesting that the final product may still be years away from release, the report added.\n\nThough it seems unlikely, it's not out of the realm of possibility. In January 2014 Apple board member and J. Crew Group CEO Mickey Drexler told a New School audience that Steve Jobs was keenly interested in developing a car. At the event Drexler said:\n\n\"Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.\"\n\nDrexler went on to reveal how at an Apple board meeting he had criticized Tesla cars for being ugly, but Jobs immediately shot back that Drexler didn't know what he was talking about. Jobs then told him that Tesla cars were beautifully designed on the inside and the company was building more than just a car -- they were building a platform.\n\nAnd when talking about Tesla, that's where things start to get really interesting. Just days ago Business Insider reported the following:\n\n\"Last week we reported on a mysterious Apple van making its way around San Francisco. After writing about how the van could be used for a self-driving car, we got an unsolicited email from an employee at Apple about 'vehicle development' at the company. This person said Tesla employees were 'jumping ship' to work at Apple.\n\n'Apple's latest project is too exciting to pass up,' the person said. 'I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'\"\n\nThis meshes with earlier reports that Apple was offering a $250,000 signing bonus and 60% salary increase for Tesla employees who came to work for Apple--something Elon Musk has said isn't accurate, but didn't deny completely.\n\nWith the Tesla hires and the images of an apparent self-driving car, it seems possible that Apple is at least working with autonomous car technology. Does that mean we'll see an iCar soon? It's unlikely. Such a product like that would require infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities Apple wouldn't be able to keep under wraps. Still, that doesn't mean Apple isn't working on something to do with self-driving cars. It's possible it's testing beta versions of its CarPlay software that give a driver greater control over their vehicles, including starting or stopping a car, rolling up windows, unlocking doors--and maybe even setting destinations and routes for self-driving cars.",

In the same year, its senior vice president, Phil Schiller, had also admitted that the company has been struggling with the idea even before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.\n\nLast year, Apple had also introduced a software system for auto-manufacturers, called the CarPlay.

Under his guidance, the company has made bold new moves in areas that Jobs wouldn't have ventured into, such as a large screen iPhone, and a phablet device seeing tremendous success.\n\nWhile details on the new project are scarce, the ambitious new idea sees the company make a shift from its current business model of selling electronic devices to car manufacturing.\n\nAccording to the report, the project code name is dubbed \"Titan\" with an estimated several hundred employees working to bring this exciting new idea into a reality.\n\nMore car manufacturers are looking at ways to bring self driving cars to the market along with some using semi trucks autonomously as a way to cut down on traffic accidents which will make for safer roadways.\n\nSelf driving cars, are a complex bit of engineering that requires a lot of research and development. Apple is a company that also specializes in software, and has an advantage by utilizing its own proprietary applications to carry out its autonomous goals.\n\nTo better compete against Tesla Motors, rumors have suggested that Apple has been hiring car experts for the project. The company has already made an entrance in the automotive field with its CarPlay services, which is available on just a few road cars via dashboard console.\n\nNothing has been confirmed from Apple, and many think that this is just nothing more than a rumor. An autonomous vehicle would take the company years to complete, and as with most of Apple's premium products, the price of admission won't be cheap which are all major factors for healthy profit margins.\n\nIt's a lot easier to spend money on a smartphone with short life cycles versus a car which people expect to last many years with low maintenance. Owning a car and a house are one of the most expensive items a person can get into, and if this rumor is to be true, it will be interesting to see how Apple's strategy plays out.\n\nStill, reports continue to swirl about how the tech giant is steadily recruiting auto industry experts and it's up to Apple to confirm or deny these claims.",

So, why is news leaking on it today?\n\nHere's his take, our emphasis added:\n\nAside from yesterday's articles on project Titan, we also note that a week ago, numerous blogs reported on Apple-owned vans with cameras mounted on top, driving in San Francisco and Brooklyn, which pointed to Apple potentially testing a Street View type product or self-driving car product. Given the WSJ article's report that Apple CEO Tim Cook approved project Titan a year ago, the question is why is this information coming out now? We believe the most logical answer is to provide investors with some insight into Apple's coming plans without making any public statements. History seems to be circular for Apple as many wonder if Apple can break the $1 trillion dollar market cap barrier, which is similar to the speculation when shares were at their highs after the iPhone 5 launch. We believe, at that time, the biggest concern from investors was that the company didn't have any products compelling enough to fuel belief in another leg to the model. We believe that floating the potential of a car now could be to help investors dream about the type of projects yet to come from Apple.\n\nFor what it's worth, here's our take: Good reporters break news, and that's what happened here.\n\nHowever, if you want a more conspiratorial angle, we have this: It helps Apple to recruit people if this information is out there. Imagine if Apple's recruiters are trying to poach people from car companies. Before the news hit, would those people really think Apple was serious about the car?\n\nFurther, it's really hard to make a car in total secrecy. It's a big device that needs to be perfected outdoors. It was hard to keep it totally under wraps.",

This might explain Apple's interest in poaching employees from Tesla. In any case it should all be taken with a grain of salt for now, but it definitely does seem like an interesting direction for Apple to be headed.",

It's all about autonomous driving,\" the source said.\n\nApple may be pursing mainly expertise rather than full-scale partnerships, a pattern that has a long history.\n\nIn 2005, two years before it released the iPhone, Apple worked with Motorola, then the world's second-largest mobile phone maker, to develop the Rokr, a phone with integrated iTunes music and media-playing features. Capable of only holding 100 songs, the phone flopped, and briefly called into question Apple's ability to break into new product categories.\n\nMore recently, in developing the soon-to-be-launched Apple Watch, the company held limited talks with Swiss watchmakers, but no broad-based alliance emerged from the discussions.\n\nInstead of partnerships, Apple pursued a go-it-alone strategy and turned to poaching talent from top watchmaking brands.\n\nAmong the high-profile hirings Apple has made from the auto industry was Johann Jungwirth, President & CEO, Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America. Jungwirth could not be reached for comment.\n\nA spokesman for Daimler on Saturday said that the team of engineers which developed the Mercedes-Benz autonomous car remains intact and that Jungwirth was mainly specialized in integrating smartphone functionality and developing advanced user experiences.\n\nAccording to Jungwirth's Linkedin profile he joined Apple in September. At Daimler his responsibilities from March 2009 to September 2014 included overseeing Connected Car & UI Telematics, Autonomous Driving, Advanced User Experience Design, Powertrain & eDrive, Advanced Exterior Design and Mercedes Benz style, group research and regulatory affairs, the profile said.",

The Financial Times also reported on the matter, saying the lab - which is very much akin to Google's own autonomous project - was set up late last year, just after Apple officially unveiled its upcoming smart watch and latest batch of iPhones. Now, Reuters also discussed with an unnamed senior auto industry source that has been made aware of Apple-carmakers discussions. \"They don't appear to want a lot of help from carmakers,\" said the source, as the Cupertino giant discussed its project with experts at automakers and automotive suppliers.\n\nOne fact seems clear from the reports coming in so far, including from Reuter's source - the mobile and computer developer is mulling the complete development of a vehicle, and is not interested in coming up with software or components. The person added that Apple is mainly focused on gathering advice on parts and production, with an accent on electrification and connected-car technologies - with the automated driving cited as a possible direction as well. \"Fully automated driving is an evolution. Carmakers will slowly build the market,\" commented the source. \"Apple is interested in all the potential ways you can evolve the car; that includes autonomous driving.\" So far, it remains to be seen if it will initially introduce an electric car or skip all steps and jump into the autonomous vehicle bandwagon.",

The company announced that they have now received the federal government's approval, and they will begin accepting payments this fall. Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke at the White House Summit on Cybersecurity and Consumer Protection on Friday and announced the move, which received backing from the United States government. Apple Pay will now be used for payment cards, and even admission to national parks according to Cook, and will be even more proof that the payment system - that raised questions at its original launch - is doing very well.\n\nApple Pay has earned its stripes with security. Cook noted while speaking, \"This is another product where security was not an afterthought.\" This news, too, comes the same week when Apple furthered their two-step authentication to iMessage and FaceTime, in order to improve security within those functions as well. Overall, it is been a mission for Apple since the data breach in the fall to deliver really on consumer security. While other companies are experiencing regular and deliberate attacks - Apple continues to pave the way when it comes to security - and in one of the most-challenging areas to make security functional.\n\nSee Also: Apple's secret car project spotted in Silicon Valley while Tesla poaches its talents.\n\nAnalysts believe that this will only improve Apple's already good standing with Apple Pay and will allow Apple to assert itself further as the best in the mobile payment space. However, with competition coming from other companies - it will be important for Apple to continue developing their base in terms of retailers who are working with them. This though is also a big deal for the federal government, as it shows signs that they are modernizing in how they approach accepting payments. This conference was a major move for the United States government, but also for Apple, who has a continually growing role in improving technology globally, and influencing the way technology is used in the world. Apple Pay will likely have payment methods expanded in the federal government to build that relationship even further. Since launching in October, Apple Pay has set itself as one of the most-dominant payment methods on the market.",

                    "body": "When people spotted suspicious cars and vans cruising the streets of Silicon Valley last week, it gave rise to some very interesting rumors recently. When vans moved around suspiciously with big clunky looking camera setups on their roofs, it fuelled rumors about the Apple iCar. These initial rumors also mentioned reports of a LIDAR equipped SUV prowling through the San Francisco Bay area. Google already has a name for itself when it comes to its company cars roaming the streets to map for Google street view. So, at that time it fuelled rumors that Apple may be up to a somewhat similar trick, especially when the Cupertino giant had come out in the open regarding its intention to build an independent Apple Maps system for its phones.\n\nBut when news trickled out, about Tesla engineers being picked up by Apple, it could not stop the rumor mongers coming up with this first instinctive anticipation. That Apple could be working on a car. Of course, the strangeness of this story, that of a technology company building a car, is not missed upon anyone.\n\nHowever, it also creates an interesting and exciting future for Apple who may just revolutionize the personal vehicle segment with something of an iCar like vehicle, the way Apple under Steve Jobs changed the world and how the world looked at mobile phones.\n\nMost of these rumors are based on employee information from Apple, which have confirmed suspicions of Apple is working on its own iCar. An employee had even written that Apple is working on something that 'will give Tesla a run for its money'. It became hard for most tech enthusiasts to not miss the apparent connections being driven at.\n\nThese rumors came out of the low grade churning mill and became a worldwide news, when only yesterday, even Britain's national newspaper, 'The Guardian' carried out a news report over Apple's unannounced intention to build an iCar that may be in development, as the newspaper added.\n\nAlthough, commentators have lampooned this recent news item, by comparing, how Apple's first attempts at car development could give rise to similar problems that were faced by the first Gen iPhone users. The issues that were noted, were frequent crashes, bugs, and the tendency by Apple to push Apple Maps, which apparently no one wants. Yet, enthusiasts are eager about this innovation that Apple may bring to the car industry and expect Apple to weave the same kind of magic and miracle which it did in the case of mobile phones.",

You don't really expect to hear about a car. You are now, because a couple of rumours appeared over the weekend regarding Apple's own automotive ambitions.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Apple has hundreds of people working on a project codenamed 'Titan'. It's supposedly involves developing an electric car, something that it's going to be developing over the next few years until it gets everything right. If it's true, it means Apple is in it for the long haul and plans on making Steve Jobs's 'iCar' dream a reality.\n\nA follow-up rumour from Reuters claims that this car will also be self-driving, and according to an anonymous source it's so that Apple is once again positioning itself to take on Google. But, unlike the report from the Wall Street Journal, Reuters is reporting that it's less about the actual car, and more about the software controlling it.\n\nBoth of those reports seem to conflict with each other, but it is more than possible that the car mentioned by the WSJ is a prototype that will be used to test Apple's own self-driving system. Similar to how Google has been doing things so far. From there it can sell the tech and associated systems to other car manufacturers to implement in their own vehicles.\n\nBoth points are unconfirmed rumours for now, and since it sounds like it's early days then we probably won't be hearing anything official for quite some time. Apple has been working on cars already with CarPlay, so expanding its focus certainly isn't a stretch of the imagination.",

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, that may indeed be a likely scenario, as \"people familiar with\" the tech giant's so-called Project Titan have told the news agency that there are hundreds of Apple employees working on an all-electric automobile project. The vehicle being created is said to resemble a minivan, and we're sure any resulting product would be the most stylish such box on wheels ever conceived.\n\nSteve Zadesky, a Vice President at Apple in product design who previously served as an engineer at Ford, is said to be leading the group. In September of last year, the Cupertino-based firm hired Johann Jungwirth from Mercedes-Benz, reportedly to work on Project Titan, and executives from Apple have met in Austria with Magna Steyr, a firm that has plenty of experience manufacturing automobiles for contract partners.\n\nRumors of a so-called iCar from Apple have appeared on these pages for years, but this time, the level of detail surrounding the reports lend an additional layer of credence to the notion that Silicon Valley may have another potential automaker on its hands. Indeed, reports of employee poaching between Apple and Tesla have circulated in recent weeks, with massive signing bonuses for those who choose to switch allegiances in the hotly-contested Silicon Valley job market.\n\nWe have no idea if Apple will indeed enter the electric car market, but the notion that it's dipping a few toes into the waters are anything but a shock. It's worth noting, too, that tech rival Google has similar interests in the automobile market. A report from Reuters suggests that Apple may follow Google into self-driving, autonomous automobile development. In any case, you can be sure we'll be paying rapt attention as the story unfolds.",

Yet that doesn't essentially mean Apple will invest its precious money in the tremendously muddled and costly automobile fabricating business. It could supply programming to progressively robotized and electronic vehicles made by others, as examiners anticipate Google will look in to taking charge from there onwards. On the other hand, as Apple has with different items, it could add to a configuration and outsource the assembling to others.\n\nThe Journal also reported that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook endorsed an auto extend a year back and put it in the consideration of Apple's Steve Zadesky, a previous Motor Co. engineer at Ford. Cook approved Zadesky to make a group of 1,000 specialists, as per the Journal's anonymous sources. Apple enlisted Johann Jungwirth, a previous Mercedes-Benz official, last September, the Journal reported.\n\nApple administrators have met with car producers in Austria, as indicated by the Journal, incorporating with Magna Steyr, situated in Graz and an auxiliary of Canadian Magna International.\n\nIf all this is true, the world can soon see an environment friendly battery operated car which will have the blessing of none other than Apple itself.",

Numerous reports from reliable sources including The Wall Street Journal and Reuters have since surfaced suggesting that Apple is working on its own self-driving car that will be powered by an electric engine, and these vans are believed to be a part of that project.\n\nNow, the first video of one of these cars has been posted.\n\nDON'T MISS: 10 million stolen passwords were just released - here's how to see if yours is one of them\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Apple is working on its own car. Not just car technology, as some have speculated, but an actual automobile that could some day be on the roads.\n\nIf Apple does release its own car someday, it will obviously look absolutely nothing like the \"Apple van.\"\n\nApple is apparently testing several Dodge Caravan minivans equipped with mysterious additional equipment. We have seen a few photos of the vans, which have an odd camera rig on the roof that was initially thought to be part of an initiative for Apple Maps similar to Google's Street View.\n\nAs is turns out, these rigs are apparently related to Apple's car efforts, which have seen the company hire a number of automobile industry experts away from Tesla in recent months. In fact, Apple is already in the process of building a massive team to work on these new efforts.\n\nWhile the exact purpose of the equipment on the vans Apple is testing remains unknown, the first video of the automobile comes from MacRumors and it's embedded below.",

Now it appears Apple will undertake an all-new project, reaching far beyond sleek laptops and do-it-all cell phones: electric cars.\n\nAccording to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple is working on a clandestine electric automobile program, codename \"Titan,\" which already staffs \"several hundred\" employees at a secret development center, away from Apple's Infinite Loop campus. The endeavor allegedly got the go-ahead from Apple CEO Tim Cook in the early part of 2014, and could swell to include 1,000 employees in the not-so-distant future. The reported shape of the secretive Apple EV? A minivan.\n\nRELATED: Take a closer look at Google's self-driving car\n\nThe report comes just days after mysterious Dodge Caravans fitted with cameras, LiDAR laser arrays, and other computer equipment were spotted roaming the San Francisco Bay Area. The vans, one of which was tracked through the California DMV back to Apple, are believed to be tasked with fine-tuning Apple's mapping service and likely aren't directly related to the 'Titan' project.\n\nThe report goes on to say that project is headed up by Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer and designer of the iPod and iPhone. He has free reign to poach employees from different parts of the company to add to his team. This news comes after earlier reports suggested that Apple had been aggressively pursuing engineers at Tesla with large pay bumps and bonuses.\n\nConsidering the project initiated no longer than a year ago, we likely won't see an Apple-branded EV for a number of years. But if and when we do, it could very well be a game-changer, facing up against the likes of the Tesla Model X and Chevrolet Bolt.",

The technology giant is reportedly working on developing a driverless car and other automotive technology that could compete with some of the major automotive names on the planet. While it may seem like a longshot, or something that Apple wouldn't at all be interesting in - now it's catching quite a bit of attention, after many outlets had been reporting that Tesla was poaching employees from Apple, and Elon Musk was offering significant signing bonuses to those individuals who were working for the company. The results showed that more employees who work at Tesla came from Apple previously, than any other company in the world - a stat that was particularly interesting when talking about the story.\n\nNow though, it would appear as though as Apple's Industrial Design studio adds more automotive experts and builds on the design team that is currently in place. Even more impressive is the fact that one of those team members at Apple has already created a design for BMW that doesn't look terribly futuristic but is apparently a design for a fabric covered car. It is been talked that Apple's interest in the automotive space is just as far as the industry is changing. While they are not necessarily interested in becoming the next Ford or General Motors - there is a very good chance that the company will want to get in the action of self-driving cars. At least to the point of contributing software or revolutionizing software that could be a top of the line for that type of activity.\n\nIt certainly wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination to see Apple as the company which could capitalize in this market since they already have a great deal of expertise in a number of the areas that would be critical to make an automotive project happen.

Ful... http://t.co/vOUPI1obDR pic.twitter.com/o0ltHqNqxR\n\n-- Driven Magazine (@DrivenNZ) February 15, 2015\n\nThere's a backstory to how the storm of rumors over an Apple-Tesla partnership or acquisition gained even more traction. Last week, a blog that follows the latest developments of the iPhone maker discovered a patent issued to Apple Electric Car, Inc. Instantly, many jumped to conclusions that it signaled Tim Cook and Company were officially developing an EV or sending word to Tesla that the market had a new sheriff in town. No so fast.\n\nOn the contrary, the patent was issued to a company based in Miami. Apple has its home in Cupertino. Moreover, the registration was about a golf car depicted with a touch-screen. The finding of the patent appears to be purely coincidental. However, there's more to the story.\n\nAccording to sources claiming to be in the know, Apple has a team of hundreds secretly testing an electric vehicle. The not-so-covert project is called Titan, citing insider reports. Reportedly, the buzz comes on the heels of Apple minivan sightings in Claycord, California. The vehicles are to said to have been equipped with special sensors linked to navigation. This sparked rumors that the company is exploring the development of a Street View or Tesla-type competitor to challenge the market leaders.\n\nNearly a year ago, news broke that Tesla's CEO met with Apple execs, possibly to discuss a takeover. And while Musk appeared to downplay rumors that his company was on the market, he didn't fully close the door on future possibilities.\n\n\"I could certainly see us potentially doing ... something that allows people to use Android or iOS applications, but that's somewhat peripheral to the fundamental goal of Tesla, which is to accelerate the electric car revolution.\"\n\nTesla's stock has been on a rocky road as of late with Wall Street investors. With falling oil and gas prices, analysts are not sure if consumers feel the need to give up on crude just yet.\n\nBottom line: an acquisition between Apple and Tesla has not been confirmed, despite numerous reports cropping up to suggest same. But with Musk's pledge to put thousands of satellites into space with his Space X program, perhaps it's time he parted company with a niche market and beat Virgin Airlines into space?\n\n[Photo by Kevork Djansezian /Stringer/Getty Images]",

As per the WSJ report, Apple has already hired \"hundreds\" of employees for its car project, and will probably increase the number to around 1,000 employees.\n\nApple first demonstrated its interest in the automotive sector in 2014, when it unveiled its CarPlay system which facilitates iPhones and iPads in communicating with dashboard displays on high-end cars from bigwig automakers like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW, and Chrysler, among others.\n\nHowever, as per the new reports from WSJ and FT, Apple apparently has plans underway to make a more substantial investment in cars, which will most likely include a new line of electric or autonomous vehicles.",

At the moment, Apple has not confirmed any of the rumors swirling around, but the project appears to have begun about a year ago after Apple CEO Tim Cook approved a project to design a minivan type vehicle.\n\nThe program is led by Ford Motor veteran and Apple VP Steve Zadesky and involves research into battery tech, robotics and metal production, and Johann Jungwirth, former head of R&D for Mercedes Benz, is supposedly working with the Apple team. Add to that some talent poached by Apple with bonus packages of $250,000, and it seems very likely that Apple is taking its EV project seriously.\n\nIt seems that every tech company feels compelled to dive into the automobile business these days. That makes a lot of sense, as the cars of tomorrow will be all about volts and kilowatts rather than cubic inches and gear ratios. Managing the flow of electrons inside complex digital devices is what these companies do best. Autonomous cars are the frontier, cars that employ ever more sophisticated electronic systems to guide us from point A to point B swiftly and safely, then park themselves and wait patiently until summoned for further duty from our smart phones.\n\nIn other words, the future's so bright, we gotta wear shades. Except for one thing. The whole grand construct depends on developing batteries powerful enough and cheap enough that all the citizens of the world to join in the revolution.\n\nThe trick today is not to build yet another electric car that only the wealthy can afford. The trick is to build affordable electric cars for the masses. It's not about being cool; it's about weaning the world off its self-destructive fossil fuel habit.\n\nIf Apple can help with that, then bravo for them. Whether they actually end up building automobiles may be irrelevant. If their research can unlock the secrets of economic storage batteries or help construct the infrastructure we will need to keep all those electric cars moving, that will be a major contribution to the quest.",

Though not exactly the first name that comes to mind when the auto industry is mentioned, sources have suggested that the Cupertino company's interest in self-driving cars extends far beyond quaint curiosity.\n\nCoupled with recent sightings of an unusual camera-laden van which was reportedly leased by Apple, it's apparently that Tim Cook and Co. do indeed have something vehicular other up their sleeves in one form or another.\n\nOf course, the immediate assumption would be one of Apple partnering up with other automakers in order to bring the brand's technology together with the market's best vehicles from a design and engineering perspective. Comparisons have been made for some time between the technology used by Tesla when going about the design of its vehicles and that synonymous with the Apple - building a car's computer system around iOS or a wholly new platform therefore not being a particularly far-fetched principle.\n\nAccording to sources quote by Reuters however, Apple has every intention of building the whole vehicle inside and out - mechanics and all.\n\nThis would of course represent no less than the biggest and most dramatic change of direction for the brand in the company's history, though could go some way to explain why Apple and Tesla are said to be embroiled in a rather frantic staff-poaching frenzy with each other right now. With the right designers on-board, Apple certainly has the expertise and financial resources to make an electric vehicle happen - one that could give Tesla's autos a serious run for their money.\n\nStill, even with 'hundreds' of employees apparently already working on the project, it all remains rumor and conjecture for the time being as Apple is yet to make any mention of the subject or answer any direct questions.",

Apple recently hired the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research and development unit, Johann Jungwirth, according to a LinkedIn profile.\n\nWhile his title on the site is Head of Mac Systems Engineering, the Financial Times reported he had joined the new research team. Apple, which like Google is trying to incorporate its software into cars, has recently tried to recruit from the automotive industry, two sources with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters.\n\nThe company has been trying to poach experts in fields such as robotics, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n\"Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay,\" FT quoted a person who has worked closely with Apple for many years as saying. \"Today I think it's a car,\" the person said.\n\nThe research lab was set up late last year, soon after Apple revealed its forthcoming smart watch and latest iPhones, the daily said.\n\nTrying to design and build an actual car would mark a change for the iPhone maker, which researches and discards plenty of projects but has so far mainly stuck to its core expertise in mobile and electronic devices.\n\nBut it's been open about wanting to integrate its core iOS software into automobiles. The connected car, or vehicles with a full range of Internet and software services beyond mere navigation and communications, is considered one of the ripest areas for expansion for technology companies.\n\nLast March, Apple unveiled CarPlay, which lets drivers access contacts on their iPhones, make calls or listen to voicemails without taking their hands off the steering wheel.\n\nAlong with HomeKit and HealthKit, the idea is to extend Apple's software dominance into industries including home devices, healthcare, and automobiles.",

The initiative, dubbed \"Titan,\" is exploratory in nature, said one person familiar with the matter, and may never result in Apple producing a car.\n\nSeveral auto industry observers say the idea is not as outrageous as it might seem.\n\n\"The industry is ripe for disruption right now,\" said Doug Newcomb, a long-time automotive industry journalist and president of the C3 Group, which hosts the Connected Car Conference. \"Car makers have been doing the same thing, pretty much, for the last 100 years -- selling a chassis with an engine. Cars have not changed that dramatically.\"\n\nAnd Apple has a history of shaking up entrenched industries, from the music business transformed by the iPod portable music player to the telecommunications world revolutionized by the iPhone. And it certainly has the cash to burn -- $178 billion in cash as of the end of December -- to invest in such blue-sky projects.\n\nThe company has made tentative moves into the automotive space with Car Play, an in-dash system that connects to Apple's iPhone and takes advantage of the smartphone's features, including driving directions and Siri's voice control. The stereo will be offered in a range of new vehicles made by more than 30 automakers.\n\nIt's the sort of experimentation Apple did in 2005, when the company partnered with Motorola and Cingular Wireless on a phone loaded with its iTunes software (the Rokr) before creating its own device, the iPhone. The partnership lent Apple insight into the workings of the industry.\n\nIncreasingly, cars are becoming computers on wheels. Semiconductors are pervasive in modern vehicles -- controlling systems under the hood, operating facets of the drive train, offering enhanced safety features such as collision warnings and parking assists and delivering in-vehicle entertainment.\n\nThilo Koslowski, leader of Gartner's automotive practice, said the industry that long ago mastered the mechanical side of transportation is becoming more and more dependent upon advances that come from software.\n\n\"I see this as an evolution that's happening,\" Kozlowski said. \"We're entering an era of the software-defined car. It will actually elevate the importance of companies that really understand software well. That's where Apple comes in.\"\n\nAuto executives seem to appreciate that their future hinges on closer ties with the technology world. No fewer than 10 automakers exhibited at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a trade show that typically showcases televisions and gadgets.\n\nFord CEO Mark Fields used the trade show to talk about the rise of semi-autonomous vehicles, which help people stay in their lanes or automatically adjust speeds based on traffic conditions, and the future of mobility.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, has been talking with major automakers about partnerships to build self-driving cars.\n\nBehind the scenes, Apple has been plotting a possible turn behind the wheel.\n\nLast year, it hired noted industrial designer Marc Newson, who created a concept car for Ford. It also lured about 50 employees who previously worked at Tesla, according to a report in Business Insider.\n\nA company spokesman declined to comment on reports of an Apple car. Though Chief Executive Tim Cook hinted, in a September television interview with Charlie Rose, that the company has many riddles wrapped in mysteries inside enigmas.\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" Chief Executive Tim Cook told Rose. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\"",

The state of the \"smart\" car is horrendous -- like, bad infomercial horrendous -- and it's time for someone to fix it.\n\nYesterday evening, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a secret project called Titan to develop \"an Apple-branded electric vehicle.\" Then, this morning, Reuters followed it up with a report saying that Titan is a self-driving car -- a software-focused system that will aim to win the autonomous vehicle wars.\n\nWhether or not Apple's car will be driven by a human or Siri (and whether or not it even makes it to market), one thing is very clear: In-car display technology is a problem that needs to be fixed. It's not that conventional automakers aren't building technology into their cars. It's that they're doing a horrible job.\n\nCompanies have rushed to integrate touchscreen interfaces and voice recognition into their cars, and in their hurry, they've forgotten to think about the people using them. This is something our sister sites, Jalopnik and Opposite Lock, have covered again and again. These are fragmented, frustrating systems: weird icons, inscrutable buttons, confusing or just downright bad voice recognition. Knobs. Sliders. Double click. They all seem to be unique. None of them seem to work that well. Most of us end up ignoring them. Or yelling at them.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, Ford has an in-car app for ordering from Dominos.\n\nIn a prescient post from almost a year ago, the product designer Geoff Teehan took a look at the state on in-car UX. \"Despite the growth and maturity of the design industry, I firmly believe that most automotive interfaces have actually gotten worse in recent years,\" Teehan wrote, listing the many reasons that UX in cars is particularly poor, from the exponential increase in functions in the dashboard to the stifling regulation carmakers must navigate.\n\nMeanwhile, most major carmakers are mostly ignoring the most interesting thing about how smartphones can help drivers: Diagnostics. Smaller startups, like Automatic, are building plug-and-play modules that read information from car engines and on-board computers and feed that through a mobile app, making driving safer and more gas-efficient. Automatic is, essentially, building a HealthKit for your car -- and it's hard to imagine Apple hasn't noticed the possibilities of extending its own software to the automobile, too.\n\nSo we've got a whole boatload of unsolved problems that mainly fall under the heading of user experience and software development -- two things that Apple is pretty damn good at. CarPlay, in a way, is a more superficial version of what an Apple car could be -- it's iOS laid over the car's computer as a veneer, though, and is still limited by the carmaker's own dashboard.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Apple is a company that developed, manufactured, and sold hundreds of millions of versions of a product that was completely foreign to consumers ten years ago. And it did this so deftly that it's hard to remember the iPhone ever seeming weird. This kind of design Apple specializes in is inherently invisible -- the fact that we don't notice it is what makes it so good.\n\nSo maybe Apple is working on a car. Maybe it will drive itself, maybe it won't. Maybe Titan will be abandoned before any of us ever see it, left to rot in a white-roomed graveyard of broken ideas. Maybe Google or Tesla will step up to solve this problem. But good lord, someone's gotta do it.",

Instead, I've stated I thought Apple's shareholders and customers would be better served by it spending its earned money on new products - either by acquisition or by internal investment.\n\nOf all the possible investments or acquisitions they could make, I argued that the most attractive prize would be the electric car company Tesla.\n\nLate Friday, a report emerged in the Wall Street Journal that Apple has over 1000 engineers currently working on a new project to build its own car.\n\nThis is a big deal. It's even more of a shock to me that Tim Cook has decided to build vs. buy.\n\nBy choosing to internally develop a car, Apple is making a big bet: that they can make a better car than Tesla - even if it doesn't ship for years - at a much smaller cost that what buying Tesla would cost them (likely $35 billion or more after factoring in the premium they'd have to pay in order to get Elon Musk to sell).\n\nBuilding versus buying has always been the modus operandi of Apple. When I originally argued that Apple was being too complacent by choosing to return capital to shareholders instead of more aggressive product development and M&A, it provoked a strong response from two camps.\n\nIn one camp was large shareholders like Carl Icahn and others on Wall Street who believe Apple has way too much cash on hand to use it productively and therefore it should return the excess cash to shareholders. They argue that Apple can walk and chew gum at the same time: they can aggressively pursue their product development roadmap as well as return excess cash to shareholders. (Tim Cook said recently that he believes the same argument. After a certain buffer, he's happy to return excess cash to shareholders.)\n\nIn the second camp would be large Apple bloggers or strategists like John Gruber (who called me \"Action Jackson\" for my perceived advice to Apple of buying lots of companies right away), PED and Ben Thompson. They argued that the return of cash does no harm to Apple's long-term product roadmap. They also pointed out that Apple just doesn't do large acquisitions and if they did it might end up destroying the culture at Apple which is such a source of competitive advantage for the company.\n\nPage 1 / 3 Continue",

Seg\u00fan este diario, algunos ejecutivos de Apple habr\u00edan volado ya a Austria para reunirse con fabricantes de coches de gama alta.\n\nApple ha coqueteado en numerosas ocasiones con la idea de desarrollar un coche durante los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Phil Schiller, vicepresidente senior de marketing de Apple, declar\u00f3 en 2012 que los ejecutivos de la firma llegaron a discutir la opci\u00f3n de construir un coche propio, algo que qued\u00f3 confirmado cuando ese mismo a\u00f1o Mickey Drexler, miembro del consejo de Apple asegur\u00f3 que estaba entre los deseos de Steve Jobs de desarrollar un veh\u00edculo con el logo de Apple.\n\nLa compa\u00f1\u00eda de Cupertino tiene tanto la tecnolog\u00eda para fabricar un coche el\u00e9ctrico como la experiencia de gesti\u00f3n de una inmensa cadena de suministro. Apple ha investigado mucho sobre la tecnolog\u00eda de bater\u00edas para su uso en sus iPhones, iPads y Macs. y el sistema de mapas que lanz\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2012 podr\u00eda ser utilizado para la navegaci\u00f3n.

La empresa tambi\u00e9n ha llevado a cabo 'fichajes' de peso del campo de la automoci\u00f3n en fechas recientes, como el ex consejero delegado de I+D de Mercedes Benz en Norteam\u00e9rica, Johann Jungwirth, y ha contactado a la divisi\u00f3n austriaca de la empresa canadiense de componentes Magma.\n\nSeg\u00fan la revista Wired, Apple tiene 46 empleados que han trabajado en Tesla, y cientos-si no miles-que vienen del sector de la automoci\u00f3n Hace poco m\u00e1s de un a\u00f1o, Mickey Drexler, miembro del consejo de administraci\u00f3n de Apple, declar\u00f3 que, si el fundador de la empresa, Steve Jobs, viviera, \"querr\u00eda hacer un iCar\", en referencia al h\u00e1bito de Apple de poner la \"i\" min\u00fascula precediendo a muchos de sus productos, como iPod, iPhone, iTunes o iPad.\n\nEl 'iCoche', si es que se acaba llamando as\u00ed-por ahora, el nombre del proyecto es 'Titan'-, tardar\u00e1 a\u00f1os en llegar. Presumiblemente, integrar\u00e1 su propio software con el de los productos de Apple, de modo que el coche y, pongamos por caso, el tel\u00e9fono, est\u00e9n integrados, como ya est\u00e1n haciendo otras empresas como, por ejemplo, Google con los termostatos y las alarmas contra incendios con Nest. En principio, el coche de Apple parece destinado a competir directamente con Tesla.\n\nAhora bien, que Apple est\u00e9 investigando la posibilidad de construir un veh\u00edculo no quiere decir, ni mucho menos, que vaya a hacerlo. La empresa tiene la tecnolog\u00eda y el dinero, pero carece de la experiencia en esa industria. No tiene canales de distribuci\u00f3n. Y no tiene contactos con proveedores. En 2014 se hizo p\u00fablico que Apple hab\u00eda estado negociando la compra de un paquete de acciones en Tesla, pero que las conversaciones no hab\u00edan llegado a buen puerto. Google emplea coches Toyota y Roush para el Google Car, que no necesita conductor y que espera comercializar en unos a\u00f1os. Lo que s\u00ed le sobra a Apple es el dinero: la compa\u00f1\u00eda tiene 179.000 millones de d\u00f3lares (157.000 millones de euros) de liquidez. M\u00e1s de la mitad de esa cifra est\u00e1 fuera de EEUU ya que, si lo repatr\u00eda, deber\u00e1 pagar impuestos. A pesar de que Apple est\u00e1 llevando a cabo un masivo programa de dividendos, la empresa sigue acumulando reservas.\n\nSin embargo, la mera investigaci\u00f3n en ese sector puede ser muy \u00fatil para Apple. En primer lugar, todo lo que tenga que ver con bater\u00edas es clave para una compa\u00f1\u00eda que vive fundamentalmente de la fabricaci\u00f3n de dispositivos que almacenan energ\u00eda que obtienen de un enchufe. En segundo t\u00e9rmino, la integraci\u00f3n de elementos inform\u00e1ticos en los coches es una de las claves de la industria del motor. Finalmente, Cook es un experto en log\u00edstica. Y, aunque no llega a los extremos de los coches, Apple es una empresa que fundamentalmente dise\u00f1a y ensambla, dejando la fabricaci\u00f3n subcontratatada a terceros.\n\nApple, siguiendo su la opacidad que es habitual en ella -y en los dem\u00e1s gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos- no ha confirmado ni desmentido la noticia. Pero eso no ha aplacado la especulaci\u00f3n. Seg\u00fan la agencia de noticias Reuters, el veh\u00edculo en el que est\u00e1 trabajando la empresa de la manzana s\u00ed ser\u00e1 aut\u00f3nomo, es decir, no necesitar\u00e1 conductor.",

                    "body": "Apple Inc. puede estar ya en condiciones de convertirse en un fabricante de autom\u00f3viles mundial en muchos aspectos mientras que otras empresas de Silicon Valley no lo est\u00e1n.\n\nLa empresa de tecnolog\u00eda con sede en Cupertino, California, puso a unos cientos de empleados a trabajar en un proyecto secreto para desarrollar un autom\u00f3vil el\u00e9ctrico, dijo una persona familiarizada con el asunto.\n\nApple, con una capitalizaci\u00f3n de mercado que es m\u00e1s de US700.000 millones, tiene que seguir creciendo en ventas de iPhones, su mayor generador de ingresos, a la vez que expandirse en nuevos mercados, tales como autom\u00f3viles, si se trata de llegar a una valoraci\u00f3n de US1 bill\u00f3n, dijo Gene Munster, analista de Piper Jaffray Cos. A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que \u00e9l no cree que Apple pueda lanzar un coche en los pr\u00f3ximos cinco a\u00f1os.\n\nSin embargo, Apple cuenta con algunas ventajas frente a otras empresas de Silicon Valley con ambiciones de autom\u00f3viles. Tesla Motors Inc., que ofrece menos de 10.000 veh\u00edculos por trimestre, sorprendi\u00f3 a los inversores el mes pasado cuando el m\u00e1ximo responsable ejecutivo, Elon Musk, dijo que la empresa no ser\u00eda rentable hasta el a\u00f1o 2020.\n\nLos puntos fuertes de Apple como potencial fabricante de autom\u00f3viles incluyen:\n\n1. US178.000 millones\n\nLa industria del autom\u00f3vil se mueve a trav\u00e9s del efectivo a un ritmo asombroso. Apple, como resulta ser, tiene una reserva de efectivo de casi US180.000 millones. Como dijo Musk la semana pasada, Apple se est\u00e1 \"quedando sin maneras de gastar el dinero. Gastan el dinero como si fuera agua y a\u00fan as\u00ed no pueden gastarlo suficientemente\".\n\nMientras que la antigua regla de oro era que costaba alrededor de US1.000 millones desarrollar un coche nuevo, esos costos est\u00e1n siendo distribuidos en m\u00e1s veh\u00edculos ya que las automotrices tradicionales trabajan para utilizar plataformas de veh\u00edculos para m\u00e1s modelos, dijo Dave Sullivan, analista de la industria automotriz de AutoPacific.\n\nEso ser\u00eda un desaf\u00edo para Apple, al igual que la falta de experiencia en la construcci\u00f3n de autos, aunque Thilo Koslowski, vicepresidente y l\u00edder de la pr\u00e1ctica de automoci\u00f3n en Gartner, dijo que podr\u00edan adquirir aquellas habilidades de fabricaci\u00f3n.\n\n2. El \u00faltimo dispositivo m\u00f3vil\n\nApple ha construido su fortuna sobre la base de la creaci\u00f3n de productos que est\u00e1n dise\u00f1ados de manera atractiva y que integran el software de tal manera que sumergen de manera mas profunda la vida de los usuarios en el mundo de Apple, comprometi\u00e9ndolos m\u00e1s para futuras actualizaciones. Y ya cuenta con tecnolog\u00eda adaptada a los autom\u00f3viles - software de mapas, por ejemplo - lista para usar.\n\n\"El coche es una de las piezas m\u00e1s importantes y cr\u00edticas del rompecabezas que se debe dominar si se quiere interactuar con los clientes dondequiera que est\u00e9n\", dijo Koslowski. \"Es muy importante tener un tel\u00e9fono que est\u00e9 conectado, y que puede mostrarle su calendario y hacer todo tipo de otras cosas, pero ahora extendi\u00e9ndolo a este otro dispositivo que tiene cuatro ruedas\".\n\n3. Muchachos de coches\n\nApple tiene una mezcla \u00fanica de ejecutivos con experiencia en tecnolog\u00eda y veh\u00edculos. La empresa contrat\u00f3 durante mucho tiempo ingenieros del espacio de la automoci\u00f3n, a menudo con experiencia en la gesti\u00f3n de la cadena de suministro, tecnolog\u00eda de bater\u00edas y experiencia en la interfaz de usuario.\n\nLuca Maestri, director financiero de Apple, pas\u00f3 20 a\u00f1os en General Motors en las \u00e1reas de finanzas y operaciones. Eddy Cue, el influyente vicepresidente s\u00e9nior de software de Internet, es un entusiasta de coches y miembro del consejo directivo de Ferrari. Steve Zadesky, vicepresidente de dise\u00f1o de productos iPhone, que lidera el esfuerzo de Apple para el proyecto de los coches, pas\u00f3 tiempo trabajando en Ford a principios de su carrera.\n\nMarc Newson, un prestigioso dise\u00f1ador industrial que se uni\u00f3 al equipo de dise\u00f1o secreto de Apple el a\u00f1o pasado, hizo un concepto de coche de alto perfil para Ford en 1999.\n\n4. Red Minorista\n\nUna de las fortalezas - y debilidades - de los fabricantes de autom\u00f3viles tradicionales ha sido su red de distribuidores. Es dif\u00edcil abrir frentes de tienda en todo el mundo lo suficientemente r\u00e1pido como para obtener la escala necesaria para vender veh\u00edculos. En los EE.UU., se a\u00f1aden complejidades tales como las leyes estatales sobre las franquicias, que generalmente proh\u00edben a los fabricantes vender coches directamente a los clientes.\n\nEso es algo que Tesla ha tratado de cambiar dr\u00e1sticamente. En lugar de vender a trav\u00e9s de los distribuidores autorizados, el fabricante de autom\u00f3viles con sede en Palo Alto, California opera sus propias salas de exposici\u00f3n - que fueron creadas por un ex ejecutivo de Apple - y toma pedidos a trav\u00e9s de Internet. La iniciativa ha provocado la ira de los distribuidores con franquicia y el fabricante de autom\u00f3viles entr\u00f3 en conflicto con grupos de concesionarios el a\u00f1o pasado en Georgia, Missouri, Nueva Jersey, Nueva York, Ohio y Pensilvania antes de alcanzar acuerdos.\n\nApple, por supuesto, ya cuenta con una red minorista gigante a trav\u00e9s de sus cientos de tiendas de Apple en todo el mundo, desde Brasil hasta Suecia y Turqu\u00eda.\n\n5. Apple act\u00faa globalmente\n\nEl negocio de la automoci\u00f3n tiene una complejidad global como algunas otras industrias, con temas de regulaci\u00f3n, marketing y log\u00edstica que pueden hacer tropezar el negocio de capital intenso en cualquier d\u00eda.\n\nApple, que dise\u00f1a sus productos en California, pero depende de contratistas para ensamblarlos en su mayor\u00eda en Asia, est\u00e1 acostumbrada a dirigir una cadena de suministro a tiempo en todo el mundo - algo que Google Inc. no hace en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda de su negocio de b\u00fasqueda de Internet - y al manejo de las complejidades en las oscilaciones de la moneda en todo los mercados globales.\n\nEl m\u00e1ximo responsable ejecutivo, Tim Cook, construy\u00f3 su reputaci\u00f3n en Apple por su capacidad para navegar esas operaciones globales. \"Eso ser\u00eda una gran ventaja si se deciden a fabricar coches,\" dijo Tim Bajarin, presidente de Creative Strategies.",

Seg\u00fan el diario Financial Times, Steve Zadesky, que lleva trabajando en Apple 16 a\u00f1os en el desarrollo de los iPod y iPhone, ser\u00eda la persona al frente de la nueva unidad de la compa\u00f1\u00eda, de acuerdo a fuentes cercanas a la empresa. El peri\u00f3dico precisa que el nuevo laboratorio habr\u00eda sido creado a finales del pasado a\u00f1o y que en cualquier caso har\u00edan falta a\u00f1os para que el nuevo producto fuera realidad, y que al igual que otros proyectos de Apple podr\u00eda no ver la luz nunca.\n\nTambi\u00e9n el diario The Wall Street Journal ha informado sobre los supuestos planes automovil\u00edsticos de Apple. El diario estadounidense, aludiendo a fuentes no identificadas, public\u00f3 el viernes que Apple se refiere a los trabajos encaminados a la creaci\u00f3n de un autom\u00f3vil el\u00e9ctrico como Proyecto Tit\u00e1n. La compa\u00f1\u00eda creada por Steve Jobs no ha querido comentar las informaciones publicadas.\n\nTanto Apple como otras compa\u00f1\u00edas tecnol\u00f3gicas est\u00e1n ya de alg\u00fan modo presentes en la industria del autom\u00f3vil. Apple y Google lanzaron el pasado a\u00f1o sus plataformas aplicables al autom\u00f3vil, que suponen el aprovechamiento de la tecnolog\u00eda de la telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil e internet a la conducci\u00f3n. Apple cuenta con CarPlay y Google con Android Auto. Ambas compa\u00f1\u00edas negocian con decenas de fabricantes de autom\u00f3viles para incluir sus tecnolog\u00edas en los coches.\n\nSeg\u00fan datos de la consultora especializada en automoci\u00f3n SBD y del GSMA (Groupe Speciale Mobile Association) el 90% de los veh\u00edculos que salgan al mercado hasta 2020 contar\u00e1n con alg\u00fan elemento de conectividad. Estas novedades supondr\u00e1n un mercado valorado en 39.000 millones de euros en 2018, un 300% m\u00e1s de los 13.000 millones que movi\u00f3 en 2012.\n\nGoogle anunci\u00f3 a mediados del pasado a\u00f1o un prototipo de coche aut\u00f3nomo, que no precisa la interacci\u00f3n humana para la conducci\u00f3n. Anteriormente la compa\u00f1\u00eda hab\u00eda mostrado proyectos de conducci\u00f3n aut\u00f3noma en conjunto con Toyota, en modelos Prius adaptados. La propuesta de Google es un veh\u00edculo de dimensiones reducidas. Los coches de Google no tienen pedales, volante ni, obviamente, asiento del conductor. Los prototipos que ha construido el gigante tecnol\u00f3gico a trav\u00e9s de acuerdos con distitnas compa\u00f1\u00edas tienen capacidad para dos pasajeros, seg\u00fan desvel\u00f3 en mayo el cofundador de la empresa Sergei Brin en una conferencia en California.",

Seg\u00fan el peri\u00f3dico estadounidense The Wall Street Journal, cientos de empleados de la empresa de la manzana han empezado a trabajar en un proyecto llamado \"Tit\u00e1n\": una minivan 'smart'.\n\nFuentes del portal afirman que desde hace un par de d\u00edas autom\u00f3viles con extra\u00f1os dispositivos instalados han sido vistos en el campus de Apple.

Aunque su cargo en la compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tim Cook es el de jefe de sistemas de ingenier\u00eda de Mac.\n\nA\u00fan no hay muchos datos sobre este autom\u00f3vil.

Al rumor inicial lanzado por el WSJ se uni\u00f3 pronto el de Reuters, que pon\u00eda el foco en el coche aut\u00f3nomo. L\u00f3gico.\n\nLa opci\u00f3n de un coche de Apple me parece m\u00e1s que lejana, pero ah\u00ed tenemos a Tesla como referente de uno de los pocos segmentos que ahora mismo se pueden considerar innovadores y hasta sexy tecnol\u00f3gicamente hablando. Tiene un coche, no vende como los grandes fabricantes, pero sin embargo ya se le relaciona con el futuro del coche y lo m\u00e1s importante, con la idea de liderazgo sobre c\u00f3mo debe ser ese coche de los pr\u00f3ximos 25 a\u00f1os. Y a Apple seguro que esa imagen le tienta.\n\nPero en el mundo del coche, especialmente el\u00e9ctrico y conectado, nada es sencillo.\n\nM\u00e1s all\u00e1 del coche del futuro en s\u00ed, la primera gran batalla que se est\u00e1 librando es de liderazgo. Ya enfrentamos a los fabricantes tradicionales con los nuevos y m\u00e1s tecnol\u00f3gicos, y sin duda que el camino hasta llegar al coche que conduzcamos en 25 a\u00f1os va a estar plagado de disputas.\n\nA favor de un coche del futuro gestionado principalmente por empresas que es lo que han estado haciendo estos \u00faltimos 100 a\u00f1os hay bastantes argumentos. El principal nos dice que a lo largo de este tiempo han sabido incorporar nuevas tecnolog\u00edas manteniendo la seguridad. Pero, \u00bfpodemos seguir con este ritmo en la era smart y las startup?\n\nLa percepci\u00f3n que tiene el usuario indica que no. Para ellos, en el coche del futuro lo que realmente va a importar y marcar diferencias es el control, la seguridad, la innovaci\u00f3n y la fiabilidad, perdiendo peso los aspectos relativos al motor, la transmisi\u00f3n y el dise\u00f1o. As\u00ed que ah\u00ed son las empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas las que est\u00e1n llamadas a ser l\u00edderes y no creo que Apple no quiera estar entre ellas.\n\nSi asumimos que el coche del futuro estar\u00e1 liderado por empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas, \u00bfse puede permitir Apple no estar entre ellas?\n\nEn ese cambio que debe venir con el coche del futuro, como hemos dicho, las tecnol\u00f3gicas llevan las de ganar a priori, pues de ellas va a depender parte de la ciudad que est\u00e9 preparada para que por ellas circulen estos avanzados veh\u00edculos. Y ellas son las que tienen la capacidad actual para configurar esa ciudad.\n\nAunque actualmente el debate sobre el futuro del coche va m\u00e1s encaminado en una lucha entre el coche el\u00e9ctrico y el h\u00edbrido enchufable, el verdadero valor a nivel tecnol\u00f3gico e hist\u00f3rico est\u00e1 en el coche aut\u00f3nomo. Y ah\u00ed tanto empresas cl\u00e1sicas como las tecnol\u00f3gicas aspiran a ser los l\u00edderes de un mercado que pr\u00e1cticamente hay que crear de cero.\n\nEl caso m\u00e1s conocido es el de Google. La compa\u00f1\u00eda est\u00e1 desarrollando su propio coche m\u00e1s de cara a conocer un mercado donde los datos e informaci\u00f3n en tiempo real es parte esencial (y ah\u00ed quieren seguir siendo los reyes) que a construir el suyo propio. Otras grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas como Intel o Qualcomm no est\u00e1n tampoco paradas.\n\nPero en el lado tradicional nadie se queda parada. Nissan tiene su desarrollo en marcha desde hace a\u00f1os con la misi\u00f3n de poder ofrecer una soluci\u00f3n real en 2020. Y Ford es una de las compa\u00f1\u00edas que m\u00e1s novedades han mostrado en ese campo. Tambi\u00e9n para ese a\u00f1o coloca la posibilidad de los primeros modelos factibles Tesla.\n\nApple es \"sospechosa\" de estar ya trabajando en un coche el\u00e9ctrico y otro aut\u00f3nomo\n\nEn general, los desarrollos de los fabricantes cl\u00e1sicos est\u00e1n siendo progresivos, contando en primer lugar con avances de cara a mejorar la seguridad al volante por medio de un conocimiento del entorno y dejando cada vez m\u00e1s el control de la conducci\u00f3n al propio coche, pero sin pensar todav\u00eda en un coche aut\u00f3nomo de la misma forma que compa\u00f1\u00edas como Google.\n\nDentro de todo el softwate y tecnolog\u00eda que debe incluir el coche aut\u00f3nomo, los mapas son clave. De Apple no ha quedado un recuerdo precisamente dulce de su llegada a este mercado, pero como otros gigantes (Nokia por ejemplo), a buen seguro que son conocedores del valor que este servicio puede tener en el futuro del coche aut\u00f3nomo.\n\nEl coche el\u00e9ctrico es el futuro inmediato. Aunque por coste todav\u00eda se siguen considerando dentro de las gamas m\u00e1s altas (algo que aprovechamos para decir que encaja en Apple), no ser\u00e1 as\u00ed siempre. Curiosamente Tesla, el fabricante que abandera ese coche aspiracional el\u00e9ctrico de gama alta como es el Model S, tiene la misi\u00f3n de conseguir popularizar el veh\u00edculo el\u00e9ctrico. Y su arma es su megaf\u00e1brica de bater\u00edas, con la que est\u00e1 creando bastante hype pero que no le basta. De ah\u00ed su movimiento con las patentes.\n\nEs precisamente en la autonom\u00eda y tecnolog\u00eda de las bater\u00edas donde est\u00e1 la verdadera diferencia con el coche el\u00e9ctrico. Los fabricantes cl\u00e1sicos los saben y todos tienen pensado plantear alternativas al Model S de Tesla, entre ellos, Audi. Pero por ahora solo Tesla ofrece esa experiencia gracias a su red de estaciones de carga r\u00e1pida y el cambio extra-r\u00e1pido de bater\u00edas.\n\nLo m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil en la mente de todo es que Apple acabe comprando a Tesla para entrar de verdad en el negocio del coche el\u00e9ctrico\n\nSi miramos fr\u00edamente a Tesla, como apunta Calacanis y se ha venido rumoreando desde hace un tiempo, Apple parece condenada a acabar comprando a Tesla. No ser\u00eda barato, unos 75.000 millones de d\u00f3lares, ni inmediato, pues Calacanis apunta a dentro de un par de a\u00f1o, con Tesla ya en el mercado con una foto completa y competitiva.\n\nComo parte de las razones que pueden llevar a Apple a completar la compra de Tesla est\u00e1 el \u00e9nfasis alrededor de las energ\u00edas renovables, segmento que tambi\u00e9n ir\u00e1 acaparando el t\u00e9rmino de smart pr\u00f3ximamente.\n\nDe todo lo dicho sobre el posible coche de Apple me quedar\u00eda con una realidad: junto con el hogar, es el siguiente nicho que va a adoptar el t\u00e9rmino smart. Y como pas\u00f3 con los tel\u00e9fonos, seguro que Apple quiere estar ah\u00ed. Y para hacerlo han de trabajar en todas las posibilidades, m\u00e1xime una compa\u00f1\u00eda que no tiene problemas precisamente de liquidez.\n\nLo m\u00e1s inmediato que conocemos de la relaci\u00f3n de Apple con el coche se llama Carplay, y aunque por ahora no es m\u00e1s que un puente entre coche y smartphone, el futuro nos deparar\u00e1 un sistema operativo que gobernar\u00e1 la mayor\u00eda de aspectos del coche. L\u00f3gico pues que Apple tenga proyectos para conseguir comprender de la mejor forma posible este mercado que, como pas\u00f3 con el smartphone, es nuevo para ellos.\n\nPor ahora el otro equipo en el que el sistema operativo tiene pendiente confirmarse, el televisor, pese a los insistentes rumores, no cuenta con la aportaci\u00f3n de Apple.",

Tambien se habr\u00eda unido al proyecto Johann Jungwirth, antiguo Director ejecutivo de i+D en Mercedes, por lo que todo parece indicar que el Cupertino esta trabajando en un coche.\n\nSe calcula que ya podr\u00edan haber cientos de personas trabajando en secreto en el coche el\u00e9ctrico, aunque el dise\u00f1o toadav\u00eda se encuentre en los primeros estadios de desarrollo.

No est\u00e1 del todo claro si a la compa\u00f1\u00eda de la manzana le interesar\u00eda producir el coche y de que manera. Por un lado Apple no cuente con una planta de fabricaci\u00f3n de automoviles, aunque si tiene suficiente dinero como para ponerla en marcha. Por otro lado, ir\u00eda en contra de la politica de Cupertino, que siempre ha confiado en productores externos para manufacturar sus productos.\n\nDe un modo u otro, Apple ya se ha puesto en contacto con fabricantes de componentes de veh\u00edculos de lujo como Magma, por lo que el coche ser\u00e1 de todo menos utilitario. Esperando m\u00e1s datos, entrar en el mercado del autom\u00f3vil podr\u00eda suponer un punto de inflexi\u00f3n para la compa\u00f1\u00eda, que podr\u00eda incluso beneficiarse de los resultados del proyecto (materiales, bater\u00edas, circuitos,...) aunque este nunca llegue a los consumidores.",
