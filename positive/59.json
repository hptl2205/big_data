                    "body": "The murder trial of Amanda Knox recorded another dramatic chapter last night when a Florence court found both her and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito guilty of the November 2007 murder of English student Meredith Kercher in Perugia.\n Knox was given a sentence of 28\u00bd years, while Sollecito received a 25-year sentence.  Neither defendant, however, will go to prison immediately as both sets of defence lawyers announced they will appeal the verdict.  For the time being, Sollecito's passport has been withdrawn, and no action has been taken against Knox because she is living in her home city of Seattle in the United States.\n Knox did not attend the retrial, however, having gone home to the United States after the previous appeal.  \"I am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict.  Having been found innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system,\" Knox said in a statement.\n Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno confirmed that her client would appeal to Italy's highest court, and Knox's lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said he was \"stunned\".  The court will publish the reasons for its verdict in 90 days.\n For Kercher's family, who had pushed to have the appeal verdict overturned, the reaction was equally raw.  \"We didn't know what to expect.  We are still in shock,\" said Stephanie Kercher, Meredith's sister, after the ruling was read.\n If final appeals are heard, neither Knox nor Sollecito, who was banned from leaving Italy, would face arrest or jail time until a final verdict by the highest court.\n Judicial ride\nOn November 1st, 2007, 21-year-old Meredith Kercher, a Leeds university exchange student, was found half naked in a pool of blood in the Perugia house she shared with Amanda Knox.  Her body bore knife wounds.\n Knox and Sollecito, who were arrested four days after the murder, have been on a very Italian, helter-skelter judicial ride involving four trials over seven years in which, by turns, they have been found guilty and then not guilty.\n Knox, who said she was \"afraid\" to return to Italy because she might be \"wrongfully convicted\", was not in court last night.  Speaking from her home in Seattle she told her defence lawyers that she was \"horrified\" at the court's sentence.\n If this sentence were to be upheld at a forthcoming appeal, then a delicate legal problem would present itself with the Italian state having to decide either to issue an extradition request or an international arrest warrant for Knox.  Many commentators believe Italy would be unwilling to adopt such a course of action and the US even more unwilling to implement it.\n Call for guilty verdicts\nIn his closing remarks to the court, prosecutor Alessandro Crini had called for guilty verdicts for both Knox and Sollecito, arguing that the murder had occurred in the context of \"an explosive mine of sex, drugs and alcohol\".\n This Florence trial represents the fourth \"level\" at which this case has been tried.  In the first ruling in December 2009, a Perugia court sentenced Knox and Sollecito to 26 and 25 years respectively for their alleged involvement in the murder.\n That original conviction was overturned in October 2011 when Knox and Sollecito were acquitted after an appeals hearing, in part because of the testimony of court-appointed forensic investigators.  They ruled that the original Perugia inquiry had been riddled with serious errors.  In particular, forensic experts questioned the validity of DNA evidence taken from Ms Kercher's bra and from the alleged murder weapon.\n Four years in prison\nThat court ruling set Knox free after four years in prison, allowing her to return home to Seattle.\n Any suggestion that Knox's dealings with the Italian justice system had ended with the 2011 appeals ruling, though, were shattered last March when a second supreme court appeals hearing overturned the October 2011 verdict, ordering a retrial of both Knox and Sollecito.\n Knox's credibility was badly damaged when, shortly after her arrest, she wrongfully accused Patrick Lumumba, a Congolese-born musician, of the killing.  Ivorian Rudy Guede, who was found guilty of Meredith Kercher's murder, was sentenced to 16 years in a separate trial in December 2010.",

The judge in Florence ordered for Sollecito's passport to be seized and for him to be arrested.\n It was not clear when extradition proceedings will begin against Knox between Italy and the United States.  Knox, 26, and Sollecito, 29, have the option of appealing the new verdict to the Supreme Court.\n Kercher, then 21, of south London, was found dead with her throat cut in an apartment she shared with Knox and Sollecito in the city of Perugia in 2007.\n The latest trial was the second time Knox and Sollecito have been found guilty of killing Kercher.  Prosecutors claimed she was killed during a sex game gone wrong.\n Knox was represented by lawyers in Florence, Tuscany, but stayed in the United States during proceedings.  Sollecito had been in court throughtout, but was not present for the verdict, reportedly because he was \"too stressed.\" \"\nIn court for the verdict were Kercher's siblings, brother Lyle and sister Stephanie, who told reporters before the verdict: \"something terribly tragic has happened and we can't even begin to convey that to anyone else.\" \"\nAmerican citizen Knox was originally convicted of killing Kercher in 2009 by a court in Italy.  The verdict was overturned on appeal in 2011 and Knox and Sollecito were freed, after spending a total of four years behind bars.\n They were cleared of murder after doubts were raised about the methods used by police to gather DNA from the crime scene.  Heavy criticism was aimed at police for their handling of the murder investigation.\n But a second trial was ordered by Italy's Supreme Court after prosecutors argued that vital DNA evidence was ignored at the pair's appeal in 2011.  Questions were also raised about how the relatively inexperienced judges in the appeal conducted proceedings.\n Homeless drifter Rudi Guede was convicted of killing Kercher in a separate trial and was jailed for 16 years.\n Knox had been feeling \"serene\" ahead of the retrial verdict, her lawyer said.  Carlo Dalla said Knox's innocence \"was rock solid and it allows us to await the verdict with serenity\".\n Knox, dubbed \"Foxy Knoxy\" in parts of the media for her behaviour in the aftermath of Kercher's death, returned home to Seattle following her acquittal.  She has not attended the latest court proceedings.\n Her former boyfriend and co-defendant Sollecito has been present, except at the verdict.  He ran a campaign to raise funds for his defence costs after he ran out of money.  He told the court there was no motive for him to have committed \"such an atrocious act\" as killing Kercher.",

It's really hard to say what we expect the verdict to be,\" said her brother Lyle, 34.\n \"We are not going to get closure today, so there won't be any celebration on our part, but it's hopefully a step towards reaching a conclusion,\" he said.\n \"To lose someone you love so dearly is hard enough, especially in the way she died, but that has been compounded by the fact that it has gone on for six years and three months.\" \"\nKnox, Sollecito and a third person, drug dealer Rudy Guede, were initially convicted for the crime, which prosecutors said was the result of a sex game turned violent due to tensions between Kercher and Knox.\n Guede is now the only one of the three still in prison after exhausting his appeals but investigators say that multiple stab wounds on the body from two different knives indicate he could not have acted alone.\n Knox and Sollecito have always protested their innocence and Guede has changed his story several times but maintains he did not commit the murder although he was in the house when it happened.\n Prosecutors have asked for Knox to be given a 30-year sentence and Sollecito 26 years, saying the punishment should be harsher for her because she initially accused someone else of the crime, bar owner Patrick Lumumba.\n Knox says the accusation of Lumumba, as well as her since retracted memory of hearing Kercher's screams, were due to intimidating police interrogation tactics.\n Knox now says she was at Sollecito's house that night.\n The two served four years for the murder and were acquitted in 2011 but the supreme court overturned that ruling in 2013, sending the case back for re-trial.\n Thursday's verdict might still not be the final word in the long-running case since both the prosecution and the defence have the right to appeal again.\n Knox explained her absence in an email to the court in which she told jurors: \"I am not a monster\".\n If she is convicted, experts doubt that Knox could ever be extradited to Italy, but she may not be able to travel freely outside the United States if Italy issues an international warrant for her arrest.\n A guilty verdict could see Sollecito arrested in court and thrown back in jail or stripped of his passport to stop him fleeing Italy pending another appeal.",

Photo: AP\nKnox, who is in the United States and would have to be extradited to serve her sentence, said she was frightened and saddened by what she called an \"unjust\" verdict.\n Advertisement\nShe attacked the \"overzealous and intransigent prosecution\" and \"prejudiced and narrow-minded investigation\" and said she had been wrongfully prosecuted.\n \"Having been found innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system.  The evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Knox said in a statement released by her spokesman.\n Stephanie Kercher (R) and Lyle Kercher (L), the sister and brother of Meredith Kercher, react as the verdict is read.  Photo: AFP\n\"There has always been a marked lack of evidence.  My family and I have suffered greatly from this wrongful persecution,\" she said in the statement sent by spokesman David Marriott.\n Lawyers for Knox and Sollecito announced they would appeal to Italy's highest court.\n After nearly 12 hours of deliberations, the court reinstated the guilty verdict first handed down against Knox and Raffaele Sollecito in 2009.  The verdict had been overturned in 2011 and the pair freed from prison, but Italy's supreme court vacated that decision and sent the case back for a third trial in Florence.\n Murdered British student Meredith Kercher.  Photo: Getty Images\nPresiding Judge Alessando Nencini ordered the 29-year-old Sollecito's passport revoked but made no requests for Knox's movements to be limited, saying she was \"justifiably abroad.\" \"\nKnox and Sollecito spent four years in prison after being found guilty in 2009 of the 2007 murder of Miss Kercher, who was found with multiple stab wounds and her throat slit in the house she shared with Knox in the town of Perugia in central Italy.\n The two were acquitted in 2011 but the supreme court overturned that ruling in 2013, sending the case back for re-trial as Italy does not have laws against \"double jeopardy\" - prosecuting someone for a crime of which he or she had been acquitted.\n Knox did not travel to Italy for the trial and experts doubt she could ever be extradited back to Italy, but the Seattle resident may not be able to travel freely outside the United States if Italy issues a warrant for her arrest.\n Gabriele Giambrone, managing partner of Anglo-Italian law firm Giambrone Law, said it was \"very unlikely\" Knox would be extradited to serve her sentence.\n \"The US will do everything to protect their own citizens, they will mount every challenge possible so I don't think she'll serve any time in an Italian jail,\" said Mr Giambrone, who is not involved in the case.\n Legal experts estimate the case could continue until the end of 2015, though it could be brought forward if fast-tracked.\n Kercher, a 21-year-old Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found half-naked with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, central Italy, in November 2007.\n Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini said at the original trial that Knox had masterminded a drug-fuelled sex game involving Sollecito and Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast native who grew up in Italy, which turned violent, leading to the murder.\n Guede was found guilty in a separate \"fast-track\" trial in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years.  His jail term was reduced to 16 years in a 2009 appeal.  His trial found that he did not act alone because of the number and variety of Kercher's more than 40 wounds.\n Knox first told police she was inside the villa at the time of the killing and that screaming from Kercher's room alerted her to the crime scene.  She also initially named the owner of a bar where she had worked as the possible killer.  The bar owner, Patrick Diya Lumumba, was arrested and later released after a witness confirmed his alibi.  Knox later altered her story and said her original account had been coerced by the police.\n Prosecutor Alessandro Crini had requested a 30-year prison sentence for Knox, of which four were for slander, and 26 years for Sollecito, saying the murder may have been rooted in arguments about the house's cleanliness and sparked by a row over a toilet left unflushed by Guede that night.\n As with Knox, Sollecito has always denied any wrongdoing, saying all he and his girlfriend wanted at the time was to be isolated in their \"little fairy tale.\" \"\nThe original Knox trial in 2009 garnered global media attention and divided opinion along national lines, while failing to clarify what really happened on the night of the murder.  US newspapers including the New York Times argued for acquittal while UK dailies portrayed Knox as a seductive temptress with a violent streak.  Her family and friends described her as a creative and industrious student who, while eccentric, would never harm anyone.\n Sollecito's lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said during the first appeals trial that Knox was more a Jessica Rabbit than a femme fatale, explaining that like the cartoon-film character she's not \"bad, she's just drawn that way.\" \" Sollecito didn't act out of love for his girlfriend and was not Knox's \"puppy\", Ms Bongiorno told the court this month in defence arguments.\n Kercher's family were there to hear the verdict.\n \"We didn't know what to expect.  We are still in shock,\" said Stephanie Kercher, Meredith's sister, after the ruling was read.\n Agenices",

Members of Miss Kercher's family were there to hear the verdict.\n The co-accused were originally found guilty of murder in 2009, and were handed jail terms totalling more than 50 years.\n They were cleared nearly two years later - but the appeal court ordered a fresh trial in March last year.\n Today, after lengthy deliberations, the court heard that both were guilty.\n It is unknown whether the duo will appeal the decision, or whether Knox could be extradited from the US to Italy.\n Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, is serving a 16-year sentence over the death - though the courts have said he did not act alone.\n Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, central Italy, in November 2007.\n Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone awry.\n Knox and her former boyfriend Sollecito have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not even in the apartment on the night Miss Kercher died.\n Knox was convicted of the murder in December 2009 along with Sollecito following a high-profile trial, with Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito 25.\n The pair were later cleared in 2011 after an appeal court found the prosecution lacking and criticised large swathes of the case against them.\n Italy's highest criminal court, the Court of Cassation, ruled last March that an appeal court in Florence must re-hear the case against Knox and Sollecito for the murder.\n Knox, who now lives in Seattle, said she would not attend due to being unable to afford to travel to Italy and remained in the US for the duration of the retrial.\n Knox was given a sentence of 28 years and six months, and Sollecito - who has had his passport withheld - received a 25-year term.\n Speaking outside the court, Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, said she will launch an appeal against the decision.\n But he said the telephone line \"went dead\" as he told his client of the verdict.\n Mr Ghirga said: \"For those that, like me, are convinced that Amanda is innocent, it is a very difficult time.\n \"We have to respect the verdict but we will challenge them.\n \"We're very sad at the moment.\n \"We will definitely try everything.  This is not the final word.\n \"The road to the next appeal is quite difficult but we are ready for a new battle.\" \"\nSollecito's solicitor, Giulia Bongiorno, said she had not spoken to her client yet.\n She said: \"He was prepared for any outcome.  He is totally astonished why the court keeps changing mind in this way.\n \"The court gives credit to rumours.\n \"This is not a surprise.  They (Knox and Sollecito) have always been considered the murderers.\" \"\nMiss Kercher's brother Lyle, who was in the court for today's verdict, said he would not be able to forgive those responsible for his sister's death.\n In an interview with Sky, Mr Kercher said: \"I think you'd have to be a very strong-willed - arguably religious - person to find that forgiveness.\n \"I think it is so easily forgotten what happened to Meredith.\n \"When I read reports even now, I find myself skimming past the paragraphs that refer to what actually happened to her because it is so horrific.\n \"I think anybody would just need to read in detail or know what happened to her to then question themselves - could they ever forgive someone who did that to their sister or daughter?\"\nSpeaking after the verdict, Mr Kercher said: \"No matter what the verdict, it was never going to be a case of celebrating anything.\n \"That's probably the best we could have hoped for.\" \"\nIn a statement issued by Knox, read by Sky News, she said she was \"frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict\".\n She said the grief of the Kercher family \"will follow them forever\" and said they \"deserve respect and support\".\n The statement went on: \"I am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict, having been found innocent before.  I expected better from the Italian justice system.\n \"The evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Rather nothing has changed.  There has always been a marked lack of evidence.\n \"My family and I have suffered greatly from the wrongful persecution.\" \"\nKnox said this has \"gotten out of hand\".\n \"Most troubling is that it was entirely preventable,\" she said.\n She described the investigation as \"prejudiced and narrow-minded\".  She said there was an \"unwillingness to admit mistakes\", and added that there was a \"reliance on unreliable testimony and evidence\".\n Knox said there was a \"character assassination\" as well as \"inconsistent and unfounded accusatory theory\", along with \"counter-productive and coercive interrogation techniques that produced false confessions and inaccurate statements\".\n She added: \"Clearly a wrongful conviction is horrific for the wrongfully accused, and it is also terribly bad for the victim, their surviving family and society.\" \"",

Sollecito is in court today and could be promptly arrested if they are found guilty.\n On the day the deliberations began, an Italian journalist who is writing a book about the murder wrote that Knox has given him a letter addressed to the Kercher family to be given to the Kerchers if they are willing to accept it.\n Roberto Costantini wrote in Corriere della Sera today that he spoke with Meredith Kercher's sister Stephanie several days ago about the letter.\n He quoted Stephanie Kercher replying to the offer of the letter, \"I will have to think.

                    "body": "An Italian court said last night that Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, are guilty of Meredith Kercher's murder.  It has been an ongoing trial, with acquittals and rulings overturned for just over six years.  The 26-year-old American is reportedly shocked by the verdict but will not leave for Italy by choice.\n Kercher, Knox and others were sharing a flat in Italy at the time of the incident.  In November 2007, Kercher was found brutally murdered and her flatmates were arrested on suspicion of murder.  According to police, she was found with her throat slashed and 40 stab wounds in her body.  It was 11 months before Knox and her boyfriend at the time were charged with sexual assault and murder.  By 2009, they were both found guilty but appealed.\n Two years later they were released from prison after an acquittal.  The court decided that the DNA evidence was questionable, which has been something raised at the current trial.  She returned home to her family in the United States, where she was when she heard about the new guilty verdict.\n On March 26, 2013, Knox and Sollecito heard that the Italian Supreme Court had decided to overturn the acquittals.  It led to a new trial, which came to an end last night.  Many people raised the question of double jeopardy, but the law in Italy over this is quite lax.  Just because Knox was acquitted, does not mean that she cannot be tried again with the same evidence, unlike in the United States, according to Decoded Science.\n The trial came to an end with the Italian court saying that Knox and Sollecito were guilty of murder and she was sentenced to 28 years, with Sollecito facing 25 years.  The 26-year-old watched the verdict announced on live television in her home in Seattle.  She explained to the media that she is \"saddened\" by the unjust verdict, after already being found innocent.\n Her parents were also saddened and angry at the decision.  Curt Knox explained that the evidence supports his daughter's innocence and it was surprising for the court to rule the opposite way.  The evidence shows that the student was never in the room, so would not have been able to commit the crime.\n For now, Knox is remaining in the United States.  She has no plans to travel to Italy voluntarily, which will lead to a battle between the American and Italian officials.  Her lawyer, Ted Simon, explained that there is another appeals process, so extradition is not something to speak about yet.  Sollecito has not been arrested, but is having his passport taken from him.  He remains in Italy and the officials want it to remain that way.\n The Kercher family want to close this chapter of their lives, but that cannot happen until 2015 when the right to appeal comes to an end.  Lyle Kercher, the brother of the victim, stated that nothing will bring his sister back but that a conviction will help them \"move on.\" \" They are not exactly happy that the Italian court says Knox is guilty of murder, because it does not change the events that have happened.",

                    "body": "Amanda Knox arrives at court during her appeal trial in 2011.  Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\nFLORENCE -- Lawyers for Amanda Knox delivered their closing arguments in the retrial of the Seattle native and her Italian former boyfriend who have been accused of killing a British student in 2007.\n An Italian appeals court in Florence will announce its verdict later Thursday in what will be the latest development in a long-running legal saga for Ms. Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who have both maintained their innocence in the murder of Meredith Kercher.\n Luciano Ghirga, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Knox, said another man, Rudy Hermann Guede, acted alone in murdering Ms. Kercher.  \"We're firm [in our conviction] of a lack of evidence [to incriminate Ms. Knox],\" he told an appeals court.\n Ms. Knox, now 26 and studying creative writing at the University of Washington, declined to attend the retrial in Florence, saying she was afraid she wouldn't get a fair trial.  Neither she nor Mr. Sollecito, 29, was obliged to attend, but Mr. Sollecito made a few appearances in court and was present for the closing arguments.  Both deny charges of murder and sexual assault and say they are innocent.\n \"The prosecution has succeeded before in convincing a perfectly sound court...to convict innocent people,\" Ms. Knox said in an email to the court during the trial.  Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were convicted of murder and sexual assault in 2009 but an appeals court overturned the ruling in 2011.\n The Case of Amanda Knox\nU.S. student Amanda Knox, her Italian former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and key events in their trial for the 2007 murder and sexual assault of U.K. student Meredith Kercher.\n View Graphics\nShould the Florence appeals court convict Ms. Knox, she could appeal at least one more time, said another of her lawyers, Carlo Dalla Vedova.  If she loses all appeals, Italy could seek her extradition.  Italian prosecutors can also appeal if the verdict goes against them, meaning a final decision is likely at least a year away.  Mr. Sollecito's lawyers also plan to appeal a guilty verdict.\n It is unclear whether the U.S. would agree to send Ms. Knox back to Italy.  One issue in that decision would be the interpretation of double jeopardy, the U.S. legal principle whereby a suspect can't be tried twice for the same crime, say experts.\n Italian law doesn't consider a conviction final until the appeals process has been exhausted regardless of the number of times a defendant has been put on trial.\n In an interview with Italian daily newspaper la Repubblica earlier this month, Ms. Knox said she would resist extradition if the appeals end in a guilty verdict.  \"In that case, I will be...a fugitive,\" she said.\n The mystery surrounding Ms. Kercher's death and the subsequent arrest of Ms. Knox, Mr. Sollecito and other suspects grabbed the attention of the world's media and sharply divided public opinion in Italy and the U.S.\nIn November 2007, Ms. Kercher was found dead in an apartment she shared with Ms. Knox in Perugia, a university town in central Italy.  The 21-year-old student had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed, with her body also showing signs of sexual assault, according to the prosecution.\n Enlarge Image\nMembers of the media stand outside the justice palace during Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito's retrial session in Florence on Thursday.  Reuters\nIn 2008 a court convicted Mr. Guede, an Ivory Coast national who had briefly known Ms. Kercher, for her murder, sentencing him to 16 years in prison.  The ruling suggested he didn't act alone, though other possible suspects who might have taken part in the murder weren't identified.\n Mr. Guede, whose DNA was found on the body, said he was in the apartment but denied killing Ms. Kercher, saying he had been framed by Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito.\n In his arguments Thursday, Ms. Knox's lawyer Mr. Dalla Vedova said Mr. Guede had entered the apartment when it was empty and was caught off guard when Ms. Kercher returned.  He tried to rape her, and when she resisted, he killed her, said Mr. Dalla Vedova.\n In 2009, Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were convicted of murder and sexual assault and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison, respectively.  But an appeals court overturned the ruling in 2011 and Ms. Knox was freed from prison, where she had spent four years, and returned to Seattle.\n Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito have since then both published books and made television appearances.  On one television program, Ms. Knox said she and Mr. Sollecito had been at his place for the entire night of the murder.\n The reversal in the case raised questions about the credibility of Italy's justice system.  Some critics in the U.S. blasted the handling of the case as ham-handed and highlighted the multiple appeals and the retrial as emblematic of an intractable and unfair system.  The Italian government hasn't commented on the trial, but it has sought to reform the system in recent years.\n In a surprise decision last year, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a retrial, arguing that the reasoning behind the 2011 reversal had been \"contradictory.\" \" A new trial began in an appeals court in Florence in September.\n During this retrial, the defense returned to questions about the reliability of forensic evidence that had been raised during the first trial.  Back then, experts argued that DNA evidence found on a knife -- the alleged murder weapon -- was insufficient to link it to Ms. Knox.\n Public Prosecutor Alessandro Crini has called for Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito to be each sentenced to 26 years in prison.  Mr. Crini said the violence that led to Ms. Kercher's death erupted from an argument between the two roommates about cleanliness in the apartment.  He dropped the argument prosecutors used in the previous trials that the killing was the result of a sex game gone wrong.\n Mr. Crini said Thursday that he would likely appeal if the court finds the pair not guilty.\n Write to Gilles Castonguay at gilles.castonguay@wsj.com",

It was this trial that concluded on Thursday.\n From the start, the case, one of the highest-profile murder trials in recent Italian history, has been played out as much in the media as in court, with bloggers and journalists sifting through evidence and weighing in for or against Knox and Sollecito.\n Initially portrayed as a sex-obsessed party girl, Knox has seen a steady transformation of her image, helped by a sophisticated publicity machine that has portrayed her as a victim of a faulty justice system.\n Knox's lawyers have made stinging criticisms of police procedures, the handling of evidence from the crime scene and the conduct of the prosecution.\n They argued that only one person is guilty of the murder: Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year sentence for sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher.\n His trial found that he did not act alone because of the number and variety of Kercher's more than 40 wounds.\n While the initial case had argued that Knox and Sollecito killed Kercher in a sex game gone awry, the prosecution has moved away from this interpretation in the current appeal.\n The retrial has focused on a re-examination of DNA evidence.\n In closing defense arguments, Sollecito's lawyer argued that a trace of his client's DNA on a metal hook on Kercher's bra clasp was there due to contamination, because it was not collected from the crime scene until more than a month after the murder and was repeatedly touched.\n The defense and prosecution contest whether Kercher's DNA was on the blade of a kitchen knife from Sollecito's apartment, which had been used by Knox.",

It was this trial that concluded on Thursday.\n From the start, the case, one of the highest-profile murder trials in recent Italian history, has been played out as much in the media as in court, with bloggers and journalists sifting through evidence and weighing in for or against Knox and Sollecito.\n Initially portrayed as a sex-obsessed party girl, Knox has seen a steady transformation of her image, helped by a sophisticated publicity machine that has portrayed her as a victim of a faulty justice system.\n Knox's lawyers have made stinging criticisms of police procedures, the handling of evidence from the crime scene and the conduct of the prosecution.\n They argued that only one person is guilty of the murder: Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year sentence for sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher.\n His trial found that he did not act alone because of the number and variety of Kercher's more than 40 wounds.\n While the initial case had argued that Knox and Sollecito killed Kercher in a sex game gone awry, the prosecution has moved away from this interpretation in the current appeal.\n The retrial has focused on a re-examination of DNA evidence.\n In closing defence arguments, Sollecito's lawyer argued that a trace of his client's DNA on a metal hook on Kercher's bra clasp was there due to contamination, because it was not collected from the crime scene until more than a month after the murder and was repeatedly touched.\n The defence and prosecution contest whether Kercher's DNA was on the blade of a kitchen knife from Sollecito's apartment, which had been used by Knox.\n (Additional reporting by Silvia Ognibene and Antonio Denti, writing by Steve Scherer; editing by Kevin Liffey and Matthew Lewis)",

                    "body": "The six-year saga that has been the trial of Amanda Knox and her former boyfriend Rafaele Sollecito for the murder of English student Meredith Kercher in Italy in 2006 has taken another dramatic turn after the guilty verdict imposed in 2009 and overturned in 2011 was reinstated by the court of appeal in Florence yesterday.\n The pair were sentenced to lengthy jail terms: Knox to serve 28 years and six months and Sollecito to serve 25 years.  But sentences still have to be confirmed and further appeals are expected.  Knox, who heard the news at home in Seattle has indicated she would have to be \"dragged kicking and screaming\" back to Italy and would fight extradition.\n And so another chapter opens in a drama that has played out in the full glare of media from the moment Knox was first arrested over Kercher's killing in 2007.  And in Knox much of the news media has constructed the femme fatale of its dreams.\n Knox has been painted by many as the very model of a modern celebrity criminal, voted woman of the year by an Italian TV station in 2008 and in 2012 making Maxim magazine's list of the top 100 sexiest women.  Along the way, she accrued a number of other trappings of fame, notably fan mail and marriage proposals - which prompted a somewhat flattered, somewhat perplexed response.  In an ironic diary entry, she cast herself as one of the most ancient of celebrities, prized for her beauty and little else: Helen of Troy.  The swift and wide proliferation of websites, blogs and discussion boards devoted to the crime gives an indication of just how much interest the case, and Knox in particular, provoked.\n From a very early stage, the idea of Knox as femme fatale gained traction as journalists shaped the slim established facts - and the much more dense material of supposition and rumour - into a suitable product for media consumption: a beautiful young woman apparently involved in a brutal sexual assault and murder.  \"I am not the femme fatale criminal fantasy they describe.  This person does not exist,\" Knox protested to Italian TV in October last year.\n Unfortunately for \"Foxy Knoxy\", it always had been a case about a femme fatale, from the moment that footage of her kissing Sollecito outside her apartment, just hours after the murder, was disseminated around the world.\n By the time the counterspin began to churn, with the PR firm hired by her family pointing out that the nickname had been given to her as a child on the soccer pitch, it was already far too late.  While Sollecito and the other accused (and swiftly convicted), Rudy Guede, soon receded into the background, Knox was handed the role of celebrity murderess.\n One of Sollecito's lawyers even suggested that, \"being with a beautiful girl, he allowed himself to be drawn into giving her an alibi\".  Journalists in court reported that Knox frequently flirted across the court room with Sollecito, who later felt it necessary to insist he was \"not a dog on a lead - at the beck and call of Knox\".  The prosecution repeatedly cast Knox as prime architect and eager participant in the killing, and some of the press lapped it up.\n Knox has been spared no hyperbole: one lawyer called her \"a diabolical, Satanic, demonic she-devil\".  Though she has found her defenders in the media, some of the \"quality\" press has followed a similar line to the tabloids.  At times a value system has been mobilised that condemns Knox for what it perceives to be an unhealthy, immoral promiscuity.  When a writer in the Observer suggests that leaving a vibrator in a transparent washbag and enjoying one-night stands meant Knox \"knew no boundaries\", one is prompted to ask where, exactly, we are locating those boundaries - and what century we are in?\n Above all, however, it's not the sex, it's the violence.  Violent male offenders are understood to be conforming to well-established patterns of behaviour, even if their crimes provoke horror and revulsion.  But female agents of violence are, in the words of writer Ann Lloyd, \"doubly deviant, doubly damned\": they have not only broken the law, they have transgressed the \"rules\" of what is understood to be acceptable female behaviour.  A criminologist described Knox as a \"gap-year Rose West\" in the Daily Express, and a former chair of the British Psychoanalytic Association likened her supposed nonchalance in court to Radovan Karadzic's \"preening behaviour\" during his trial.\n The femme fatale meme is one means by which society has historically sought to rationalise the violent woman, to make her \"make sense\" when she seems to depart so radically from accepted notions of femininity.  It is a construct that provokes powerful and confused emotions.  On the one hand, she excites feelings of desire in the heterosexual male; on the other, she also inspires fear, and very often her erotic charge is magnified considerably precisely because of the threat she contains.\n The coverage of the murder of Kercher swiftly cast Knox in this role.  One defence lawyer felt obliged to go out of her way in an appeal hearing in 2011 to protest that Knox \"may have femme fatale looks, but is not a killer\".  Like that famous parody of 1940s noir femmes fatales, Jessica Rabbit, Giulia Buongiorno suggested, Knox was not bad - she had just been \"drawn that way\".\n The figure of the beautiful-but-lethal woman has always been \"drawn that way\", from Basic Instinct back to Eve tempting Adam.  The enduring patriarchal myth of the femme fatale embodies abiding male fears and fascination with the idea that female charm conceals indelible evil.\n It may be that this has had little or no bearing on the verdict; nevertheless, it is significant and troubling that such stereotypes continue to circulate and be drawn upon so deeply as the media constructs images of women on trial for murder.\n Journey though the courts\nNovember 2, 2007: The body of Meredith Kercher, a 21-year-old British student living in Italy, is found in her Perugia apartment.  Kercher shared the apartment with Amanda Knox, an American student, as well as two Italian roommates.\n Kercher's cause of death is a stab wound to her neck.  Tests reveal evidence of sexual activity before her death.\n November 6: Knox, her boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and bar owner Diya \"Patrick\" Lumumba are arrested.  Knox accused Lumumba of being complicit in the murder, but she later recanted that statement.\n He was released two weeks later.\n December 6: Rudy Hermann Guede, an Ivory Coast national, is extradited from Germany and put in jail on arriving in Italy in connection with the murder.\n October 28, 2008: Guede sentenced to 30 years in prison after being convicted of murder following a separate fast-track trial.  His sentence is reduced to 16 years on appeal.\n December 4, 2009: Knox and Sollecito are found guilty of murder and sexual violence.  Knox receives a 26-year prison sentence and Sollecito a 25-year sentence.\n October 3, 2011: Knox and Sollecito are ordered to be released from jail immediately after an appeals court overturns their murder convictions.\n March 26, 2013: The highest criminal court in Italy orders a retrial for Knox and Sollecito after reversing an appeals court's reversal of their convictions.\n January 31, 2014: An Italian court convicts Knox and Sollecito for Kercher's murder.  Knox, now 26 and who was in Seattle while the court verdict was reached, was sentenced to 28 years.\n Lawyers for Knox and Sollecito, 29, vow to appeal to Italy's highest court, a process that will take at least a year.",

After the verdict was read, the defendants' lawyers said they plan to appeal.  Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito have both maintained their innocence.\n \"I am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict,\" said Ms. Knox in a statement.  \"The evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Rather, nothing has changed.  There has always been a marked lack of evidence.\" \"\n\"It's a painful development, but it's simply one development,\" said Giulia Bongiorno, who represented Mr. Sollecito.\n Ms. Kercher's brother Lyle was present with their sister Stephanie for the verdict.  The ruling \"was the best we could have hoped for,\" he told reporters.  \"No matter what the verdict is there will never be a case for celebrating anything.\" \"\nThe mystery surrounding Ms. Kercher's death and the subsequent trial have electrified public opinion since Ms. Kercher was found dead in an apartment she shared with Ms. Knox in Perugia, a university town in central Italy where both were exchange students.  The 21-year-old had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed, with her body also showing signs of sexual assault, according to the prosecution.\n The following year, a court convicted Rudy Hermann Guede, an Ivory Coast national who had briefly known Ms. Kercher, for her murder, sentencing him to 16 years in prison.  The ruling suggested he didn't act alone, though other possible suspects who might have taken part in the murder weren't identified.\n Mr. Guede, whose DNA was found on the body, said he was in the apartment but denied killing Ms. Kercher, saying he had been framed by Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito.\n In 2009, Ms. Knox and Mr. Sollecito were convicted of murder and sexual assault.  But an appeals court overturned the ruling in 2011.  Ms. Knox was freed from prison, where she had spent four years, and returned to Seattle.\n Then, in a surprise decision last year, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a retrial, arguing that the reasoning behind the 2011 reversal had been \"contradictory.\" \" A new trial began in an appeals court in Florence in September.\n Ms. Knox, now 26, declined to attend the retrial in Florence, saying she was afraid she wouldn't get a fair trial.  Neither she nor Mr. Sollecito, 29, was obliged to attend, but Mr. Sollecito made a few appearances in court.  He wasn't present for the verdict, and Italian authorities will take away his passport in the coming days.\n On Thursday, the judges handed down a sentence of 25 years in prison for Mr. Sollecito and 28 for Ms. Knox.  Ms. Knox's sentence was two years longer than her 2009 sentence, although the judges didn't immediately explain that decision.\n Seven years of twists in the case have raised questions about the credibility of Italy's justice system.  Some critics in the U.S. blasted the handling of the case as ham-handed and highlighted the multiple appeals and the retrial as emblematic of an intractable and unfair system.  The Italian government hasn't commented on the trial, but it has sought to overhaul the system in recent years.\n During this retrial, the defense returned to questions about the reliability of forensic evidence that had been raised during the first trial.  Back then, experts argued that DNA evidence found on a knife -- the alleged murder weapon -- was insufficient to link it to Ms. Knox.\n Prosecutors instead argued the murder stemmed from an argument between the roommates about cleanliness in the apartment, dropping allegations used in the previous trials that the killing was the result of a sex game gone wrong.\n If Ms. Knox wins her next appeal, which will take months to hear, prosecutors can in turn appeal that verdict.  But if the American student loses all appeals, Italy could seek her extradition.\n It is unclear whether the U.S. would agree to send Ms. Knox back to Italy.  In light of the multiple appeals and trials in Italy, a U.S. judge may invoke the principle of double jeopardy, whereby a suspect can't be tried twice for the same crime, say experts.\n Instead, Italian law doesn't consider a conviction final until the appeals process has been exhausted regardless of the number of times a defendant has been put on trial.\n In an interview with Italian daily la Repubblica earlier this month, Ms. Knox said she would resist extradition if the appeals end in a guilty verdict.  \"In that case, I will be...a fugitive,\" she said.\n Source:www.online.wsj.com",

                    "body": "FLORENCE, Italy -- U.S. student Amanda Knox and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are guilty of the 2007 murder of Briton Meredith Kercher, an Italian court ruled Thursday in the latest twist in a six-year legal saga.\n Knox was sentenced to 28 1/2 years - 18 months less than the prosecution had asked.  Sollecito was to be imprisoned for 25 years, confirming the punishment inflicted at the end of the couple's first trial, in 2009.  The prosecution had asked for 26 years.\n \"I am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict,\" Knox said in a written statement.  \"Having been found innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system.  The evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \"\nDefense lawyers said they would turn to Italy's top appeals body to invalidate Thursday's convictions.  \"The ping pong will continue,\" Sollecito lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said.\n Knox and her ex-boyfriend were found guilty of several other crimes, including sexual assault, theft and simulating a crime.  Kercher's cellphones and some money were stolen, and a burglary was staged on the murder scene, prosecutors charged.\n In Italy rulings can be appealed twice, and jail sentences are normally not enforced until the process is exhausted.  This means there is currently no requirement for Knox to leave her Seattle home to face Italian justice.\n The 26-year-old allowed herself be tried in absentia, and is determined to fight any extradition attempt.  Sollecito, who also does not face immediate jail, was stripped of his passport, as the court accepted that he was at risk of fleeing the country.\n \"It was never going to be a case of celebrating anything.  It's probably the best we could have hoped for,\" said the victim's brother, Kyle Kercher, speaking in the courtroom, next to his sister Stephanie.\n The court, announcing its decision Thursday night, took almost 12 hours to deliberate.  As usual in Italy, it did not immediately explain its reasoning: Written motivations are to be published within three months.\n Judges had to ascertain whether the defendants were accomplices of Rudy Guede, a small-time drug dealer who was convicted of Kercher's murder in 2010 after two rounds of appeal.

                    "body": "Florence, Italy (Alliance News) - US student Amanda Knox and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are guilty of the 2007 murder of Briton Meredith Kercher, an Italian court ruled Thursday, in the latest twist in a six-year legal saga.\n Knox was sentenced to 28 years and a half - 18 months less than the prosecution had asked.  Sollecito was to be imprisoned for 25 years, confirming the punishment inflicted at the end of the couple's first trial, in 2009.  The prosecution had asked for 26 years.\n \"I am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict,\" Knox said in a written statement.  \"Having been found innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system.  The evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \"\nDefence lawyers said they would turn to Italy's top appeals body to invalidate Thursday's convictions.  \"The ping pong will continue,\" Sollecito lawyer Giulia Bongiorno said.\n Knox and her ex boyfriend were found guilty of several other crimes, including sexual assault, theft and simulating a crime.  Kercher's mobile phones and some money was stolen, and a burglary was staged on the murder scene, prosecutors charged.\n In Italy rulings can be appealed twice, and jail sentences are normally not enforced until the process is exhausted.  This means there is currently no requirement for Knox to leave her Seattle home to face Italian justice.\n The 26-year-old let herself be tried in absentia, and is determined to fight any extradition attempt.  Sollecito, who also does not face immediate jail, was stripped of his passport, as the court accepted that he was at risk of fleeing the country.\n \"It was never going to be a case of celebrating anything.  It's probably the best we could have hoped for,\" said the victim's brother, Kyle Kercher, speaking in the courtroom, next to his sister Stephanie.\n The court, announcing its decision at around 10 pm (2100 GMT), took almost 12 hours to deliberate.  As usual in Italy, it did not immediately explain its reasoning: written motivations are to be published within three months.\n Judges had to ascertain whether the defendants were accomplices of Rudy Guede, a small-time drug dealer who was convicted of Kercher's murder in 2010 after two rounds of appeal.  Those rulings found that he did not act alone, leaving the search open for more culprits.\n Offering a motive, Prosecutor Alessandro Crini suggested that Kercher and Knox, who were flatmates, used to argue about housecleaning.  One violent confrontation was said to have taken place in the presence of Sollecito and Guede, leading to her murder.\n Crini presumed that the deadly row was triggered by Guede not flushing the toilet during a visit to Knox and Kercher's flat.

                    "body": "Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Amanda Knox, who was convicted by an Italian appeals court yesterday of murdering a U.K. student in 2007, probably will have to wait several months before a definitive ruling in the case, a criminal lawyer said.\n Knox, 26, who returned to the U.S. two years ago as a free woman after a court tossed out her 2009 murder conviction, was sentenced in absentia to 28 years and six months in jail for murder and slander by an eight-person jury.  Her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito got a 25-year jail term.\n Yesterday's verdicts are not final because lawyers for Knox and Sollecito said they will appeal to Italy's highest court.  \"It will take months, they may schedule it around October or November,\" said Andrea Castaldo, a criminal lawyer and professor at the University of Salerno, about a possible hearing at Italy's top court.\n The defendants' lawyers must wait until the Florence appeals court publishes its reasons for yesterday's verdict, which could take as long as three months.\n An eventual extradition filing by Italy to the U.S. can be made after a final conviction by Italy's top court or sooner if authorities request \"precautionary measures\" such as an arrest, Castaldo said.  Also, her lawyers could seek to block the extradition, claiming that Italy's judicial process violated her U.S. constitutional right against being tried twice for the same crime.\n British Student\n\"It really hit me like a train,\" Knox, a Seattle native, told ABC's Good Morning America in an interview today, according to the broadcaster's website.  \"I will never go willingly back to the place where ...  I'm going to fight this to the very end.  It's not right and it's not fair.\" \"\nKnox and Sollecito were convicted for killing British student Meredith Kercher in 2007.  Sollecito was located today about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Italian border with Slovenia, according to Giovanni Belmonte, a police official in the nearby city of Udine.\n The police went to a hotel in the town of Venzone to notify Sollecito of the foreign travel ban imposed on him yesterday by the Florence court, Belmonte said.\n Sollecito voluntarily followed the agents to the police station and was scheduled to be released as soon as paperwork was completed, Belmonte said.  Sollecito's lawyers Giulia Bongiorno and Luca Maori didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment.\n Exchange Student\nBefore the death of her housemate, Knox was an exchange student in Perugia, a university town of 170,000 in central Italy known for its Baci chocolates.  She was originally sentenced to 26 years, and served almost four years in prison before the verdict was overturned in October 2011.  Sollecito, now a 29-year-old computer studies graduate, was sentenced to 25 years in jail in the first ruling in 2009 and found not guilty on appeal in 2011.\n On March 26 last year, Italy's highest court approved a prosecutor's request to void the appeals court verdicts and try the pair again.\n Kercher, a 21-year-old London native and Leeds University exchange student, was found dead in her bedroom, half-naked and with her throat slashed, on Nov. 2, 2007, in the house she shared in Perugia with Knox and two other women.\n Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini said at the original trial that Knox had masterminded a drug-fueled sex game involving Sollecito and Rudy Guede, an Ivory Coast native who grew up in Italy, which turned violent, leading to the murder.\n Crime Scene\nGuede was found guilty in a separate \"fast-track\" trial in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years.  His jail term was reduced to 16 years in a 2009 appeal.\n Knox first told police she was inside the villa at the time of the killing and that screaming from Kercher's room alerted her to the crime scene.  She also initially named the owner of a bar where she had worked as the possible killer.  The bar owner, Patrick Diya Lumumba, was arrested and later released after a witness confirmed his alibi.  Knox later altered her story and said her original account had been coerced by the police.\n Prosecutor Alessandro Crini had requested a 30-year prison sentence for Knox, of which four for slander, and 26 years for Sollecito, saying the murder may have been rooted in arguments about the house's cleanliness and sparked by a row over a toilet left unflushed by Guede that night.\n Like Knox, Sollecito has always denied any wrongdoing, saying all he and his girlfriend wanted at the time was to be isolated in their \"little fairy tale.\" \"\n--Editors: Kevin Costelloe, Dan Liefgreen",

                    "body": "Picked up near Austrian border after found guilty with Knox\n(By Christopher Livesay) (ANSA) - Florence, January 31 - Raffaele Sollecito raised suspicions he was trying to flee Italian justice on Friday when police stopped him after a brief trip to Austria, just hours after a Florence court found him guilty along with his American ex-girlfriend Amanda Knox in the 2007 murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher.\n At dawn police caught up with the 29-year-old at the Carnia hotel in Venzone, 40 kilometers from the Austrian border, to notify him he was banned from leaving the country while awaiting an appeal trial at the supreme court.\n The information technology graduate from Puglia reportedly was with his girlfriend, driving in a Mini Cooper registered to her father's company.\n Later at a police station, officers said he confessed to \"driving in Austria, then coming back to Italy\".\n \"I stopped there to rest,\" he said, according to police.\n He later told his lawyers \"I never thought of fleeing, not in the past nor now\".\n Attorney Luca Maori said his client went to police \"on his own accord\" to hand over his passport.\n He said Sollecito was visiting his girlfriend in the northeastern border region of Friuli because he was \"stressed\" by court proceedings that lasted over 12 hours Thursday.\n Rather than being detained, Sollecito was at the police station \"as bureaucratic issues were being taken care of,\" said the lawyer.  In a fourth verdict on the case, Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the stabbing murder of Kercher on the night of November 1-2, 2007 at the flat she shared with Knox in the medieval city of Perugia, central Italy.  He denies any wrongdoing, and has testified that he was having sex with Knox the night of the murder at his home.\n In an interview with ANSA Friday, Sollecito asked people for empathy.\n \"I'd like others to put themselves in my shoes.\n I won't talk about the verdict,\" he said.\n Knox, who remained in her hometown of Seattle for the appeals trial, was sentenced to 28 years and six months - three and a half years more than Sollecito because of her libel of a local bar owner she initially fingered, Patrick Lumumba.  Before the verdict was read Thursday she reiterated she has no intention of returning to Italy in a series of interviews with the Guardian.\n \"I'm definitely not going back to Italy willingly.\n They'll have to catch me and pull me back kicking and screaming into a prison that I don't deserve to be in.\n I will fight for my innocence\", Knox told the British daily.\n Knox said she had been in touch with Sollecito during the six-month appeals trial in Florence but she denied reports that he asked her to marry him to gain US citizenship and escape imprisonment.\n \"It is not true.\n I don't know where that came from,\" she said.\n The Seattle-based student, 26, said she was lucky she had been able to return to America and worried for Sollecito.  \"He's really scared and really vulnerable,\" she said.\n \"I think he feels abandoned by his own country.\n Where's he going to run and hide?  It's a shame that more people aren't fighting to protect him\".\n She said it would \"drive me crazy\" if Sollecito was jailed while she remained free.  Knox said she had been irreparably damaged by the case.\n \"I don't even know what my place is anymore.\n What's my role in society?  Who am I, after everybody has branded me?\".\n Knox and Sollecito are appealing the verdict to Italy's supreme court.\n A third man, Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede, was sentenced to 16 years in a separate trial.\n Guede, whose DNA was found inside Kercher and all over the flat, did not implicate Knox and Sollecito, whose DNA was not found at the crime scene.\n Tiny traces of Knox's DNA were found on the handle of kitchen knife found in Sollecito's kitchen, with smaller traces of Kercher's on the tip.\n Defence experts argued these findings were inconclusive but the Florence appeals court did not agree.  In her first interview after the verdict, she told American television that she felt \"hit by a train\" and \"could not believe\" what was happening.  Wearing newly bobbed hair and a pink sweater, Knox told ABC News she is \"not prepared\" to return to Italy, would never want to return, and will fight \"to the end\".  Legal experts say that extradition is possible under a 1984 bilateral treaty between the United States and Italy, one that takes precedence over a ban in the US constitution against \"double jeopardy\", or being tried again on the same criminal charges once a person has been acquitted of them in court.",

                    "body": "Best-selling American author Amanda Knox is currently awaiting the verdict of her retrial in Italy, where she remains accused by prosecutors of murdering her friend and housemate Meredith Kercher back in 2007.  Knox has previously been tried, convicted and then later saw her conviction overturned before Italy's highest court insisted on a retrial.  The Amanda Knox retrial verdict is expected to be reached and announced Thursday.  Stay with us: we will update this page with the verdict as soon as it is announced.  UPDATE: Verdict reading pushed back.  Now expected 2 p.m. EST US time.\n Knox and her boyfriend at the time, Raffaele Sollecito, were both charged with the crime and, in 2009, found themselves convicted in Kercher's killing.  In 2011, their convictions were overturned by a jury due to a lack of evidence.\n Amanda Knox Retrial Verdict: American Likely Won't Return to Italy Even if Convicted\nAfter four years behind bars in Italian custody, Knox and Sollecito were released.  In 2013, Italy's Supreme Court stated they wanted both defendants in the case retried as they didn't feel all evidence was considered by the acquitting jury.  That trial began in September 2013 and is expected to result in a verdict on Jan. 30.  In a recent interview, Knox said she would hole up at her mother's Seattle home to \"[await the verdict] with my heart in my throat.\" \"\nFollowing her release from the Italian prison where she says she suffered indignities such as being told she was HIV positive (she wasn't and isn't) and having male authority figures sexually harass her for years, Knox sought a book deal, received an offer of $4 million and wrote a memoir titled, \"Waiting To Be Heard,\" which saw success as much for its true crime grit and Knox's girl-next-door appeal.\n From the start, Amanda Knox has professed her innocence.  \"I must repeat to you.  I'm innocent.  I did not rape, I did not steal ...  I did not kill Meredith,\" Knox said in a court statement sent from the US for use in the retrial.  \"There is no scientific proof that puts me in the crime scene.\" \"\nEven if the Amanda Knox retrial verdict results in another conviction for the pretty brunette, it is doubtful the US would extradite the young author.  It seems equally unlikely Knox would volunteer to jet across the Atlantic to subject herself to a prison term that seems almost voluntary at this point.\n Co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, who has also since penned his memoir, won't have such an easy 'out' if found guilty in Kercher's murder; he is an Italian citizen and is in-country for the legal proceedings.  If there is a new conviction, Sollecito will be taken into custody to serve whatever sentence the court hands down; barring further appeals, of course.  Stay tuned for our live verdict watch updates.",

A Florence appeals panel was subsequently designated by Italy's supreme court to address issues it raised about the acquittal.\n Knox and Sollecito are expected to file appeals with the Supreme Court.  Legal experts said a further trial could take place if new evidence is made available.\n Much of the attention has focused on Knox, 26, who has remained in Seattle during the latest trial, citing her fear of \"the universal problem of wrongful conviction,\" according to her statement emailed to the Florence court.  Her representatives say she is concentrating on her studies at the University of Washington.\n She told Italian state TV in an interview earlier this month that she would wait for the verdict at her mother's house \"with my heart in my throat.\" \"\nIn a statement to the court in closing arguments, Knox's lead attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was confident his client would be vindicated.\n \"The knowledge about Amanda is innocence is rock-solid and it allows us to wait for the verdict with complete serenity,\" Dalla Vedova said.  \"It is impossible for the court to convict someone because they are 'probably' guilty or 'may be' guilty.\" \"\nLegal experts have said that if Knox is again convicted, Italy may seek her extradition, but probably not before a final judgment has been made.  If that happens, it is not clear how that may play out.\n \"Italy would usually refuse to extradite someone convicted of murder to the U.S. based on human rights grounds, because of the death penalty,\" said Argia Bignami, a Rome-based attorney and frequent commentator on criminal justice issues.  \"But that is not relevant for an extradition request to Italy from the U.S.\n\"But an extradition request is not automatic,\" she continued.  \"That's a further step that must be taken, and it's not at all clear how U.S. authorities would react to such a request or what would happen if they refused.\" \"\nUnlike Knox, Sollecito has said he would be in the courtroom when the verdict is announced.\n Some Italians said they are bothered by the fact that Knox refused to come back for the trial.\n \"I have no opinion about guilt of innocence of these two, but it doesn't seem fair that one (Knox) stays at home, while Sollecito is brave enough to appear to hear the judgment,\" said 66-year-old Sabrina Vincente, a retired law firm office manager.  \"They either committed the crime together or they did not.  It's not just to think the punishment would be given to only one half of the couple.\" \"\nContributing: Gary Strauss in McLean, Va., Associated Press\nSHARE 5 CONNECTTWEETCOMMENTEMAILMORE",

The lawyer for Sollecito, who attended the final hearing but learnt the outcome at home later that night, said his client was \"annihilated\" by the verdict.\n The presiding judge Alessandro Nencini ordered the confiscation of Sollecito's passport pending the expected appeal to the Italian supreme court.\n Italy may now seek the extradition of Knox, in line with a treaty in place between both countries.

This is the third time the pair have been tried for the killing of Miss Kercher, who died in Perugia in 2007.\n Originally convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 50 years in jail, a retrial cleared Knox and Sollecito in 2011, however an appeal for a retrial was granted early last year, leading to Thursday's reinstatement of the guilty verdicts.\n Drug dealer Rudy Guede is already serving a 16-year sentence over Miss Kercher's death, though it has not been decided whether Knox will be extradited from the US to Italy to serve her sentence.\n TOP STORIES TODAY Scarlett Johansson ditches Oxfam over SodaStream row 'Making migrants pay \u00a32k on entry would increase tolerance' Troops sent into deal with Somerset floods WATCH: Paxman speaks to Jesus and Mo cartoon creator This cat really hates junk mail\nMore from the Press Association:\nMiss Kercher, a 21-year-old Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, central Italy, in November 2007.  Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone awry.\n Knox and her former boyfriend Sollecito have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not even in the apartment on the night Miss Kercher died.  Knox was convicted of the murder in December 2009 along with Sollecito following a high-profile trial, with Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito 25.\n The pair were later cleared in 2011 after an appeal court found the prosecution lacking and criticised large swathes of the case against them.  Italy's highest criminal court, the Court of Cassation, ruled last March that an appeal court in Florence must re-hear the case against Knox and Sollecito for the murder.\n Knox, who now lives in Seattle, said she would not attend due to being unable to afford to travel to Italy and remained in the US for the duration of the retrial.  Knox was given a sentence of 28 years and six months, and Sollecito - who has had his passport withheld - received a 25-year term.\n Speaking outside the court, Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, said she will launch an appeal against the decision.  But he said the telephone line \"went dead\" as he told his client of the verdict.  Ghirga said: \"For those that, like me, are convinced that Amanda is innocent, it is a very difficult time.\n \"We have to respect the verdict but we will challenge them.  We're very sad at the moment.  We will definitely try everything.  This is not the final word.  I am very upset by this decision.  We continue to be brave, we have plenty of courage.\n \"The road to the next appeal is quite difficult but we are ready for a new battle.\" \"\nSollecito's solicitor, Giulia Bongiorno, said she had not spoken to her client yet.

They (Knox and Sollecito) have always been considered the murderers.\" \"\nMiss Kercher's brother Lyle, who was in the court for today's verdict, said he would not be able to forgive those responsible for his sister's death.  In an interview with Sky, Mr Kercher said: \"I think you'd have to be a very strong-willed - arguably religious - person to find that forgiveness.\n \"I think it is so easily forgotten what happened to Meredith.  When I read reports even now, I find myself skimming past the paragraphs that refer to what actually happened to her because it is so horrific.  I think anybody would just need to read in detail or know what happened to her to then question themselves - could they ever forgive someone who did that to their sister or daughter?\"\nLoading Slideshow Amanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nAmanda Knox Verdict Reactions\nLoading Slideshow Nov. 2, 2007\nBritish student Meredith Kercher, 21, is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130326/eu-italy-knox-chronology/\" target=\"_blank\">found murdered</a> in the Perugia, Italy apartment she shares with 20-year-old Amanda Knox, an American student.

Dijo que era \"injusta\" y el resultado de un proceso radicalizado y de una investigaci\u00f3n intransigente que trabaj\u00f3 para que el \"tribunal de justicia prevaricara\".\n \"Esto se ha salido de las manos\", dijo.  \"Habiendo sido declarada inocente anteriormente, esperaba una mejor actuaci\u00f3n del sistema de justicia italiano\".\n Tras casi 12 horas de deliberaciones, el tribunal ratific\u00f3 el veredicto anunciado originalmente contra Knox y Sollecito en el 2009 por la muerte de Meredith Kercher.  El fallo hab\u00eda sido revocado en el 2011 y la pareja fue puesta en libertad, pero la Corte Suprema italiana derog\u00f3 esa decisi\u00f3n y remiti\u00f3 el caso nuevamente a un tribunal de Florencia.\n Kercher, de 21 a\u00f1os, fue hallada sin vida el 2 de noviembre de 2007 en un charco de sangre en la rec\u00e1mara del apartamento que compart\u00eda con Knox en la ciudad italiana de Perugia, donde ambas estudiaban.  Hab\u00eda sido degollada y violada.\n Knox y Sollecito, quienes hab\u00edan empezado una relaci\u00f3n amorosa unos d\u00edas antes, fueron arrestados en el transcurso de la semana siguiente.  Un tercer acusado, el marfile\u00f1o Rudy Guede, fue declarado culpable en un juicio separado y cumple una condena de 16 a\u00f1os por el homicidio.\n Knox y Sollecito alegaron que estuvieron en el departamento de \u00e9l la noche del homicidio, donde fumaron marihuana, vieron una pel\u00edcula y sostuvieron relaciones sexuales.\n Expertos han dicho que es improbable que Italia solicite la extradici\u00f3n de Knox antes de que el veredicto sea definitivo.  Si la sentencia se ratifica, le seguir\u00eda un largo proceso de extradici\u00f3n en el que el Departamento de Estado norteamericano decidir\u00eda si entrega a Knox a las autoridades italianas para que termine de cumplir su sentencia.\n Sollecito estaba en el tribunal el jueves por la ma\u00f1ana, pero no se present\u00f3 a la lectura del veredicto.  Sus abogados dijeron que estaban asombrados por el fallo y la sentencia de 25 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel, y que apelar\u00edan.\n \"No hay ni una pizca de prueba\", dijo el abogado Luca Maori.\n El juez Alessando Nencini orden\u00f3 que se le revocara el pasaporte a Sollecito, pero no pidi\u00f3 traslado de Knox, reconociendo que ella estaba \"en el exterior con justificaci\u00f3n\".\n Los hermanos de Kercher estaban en el tribunal para escuchar el veredicto y dijeron que el resultado fue lo mejor que pod\u00edan esperar.\n \"Es dif\u00edcil sentir algo en este momento porque sabemos que habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s apelaciones\", dijo el hermano, Lyle Kercher.  Al preguntarle si se sent\u00eda satisfecho, respondi\u00f3 que \"no importa cu\u00e1l sea el veredicto, nunca va a ser una ocasi\u00f3n para celebrar\".\n Te recomendamos estos art\u00edculos:\nMr. Cash sufre ca\u00edda en vivo Firma \"poder\" para callar su condici\u00f3n de salud Grave el comediante Luis Ra\u00fal",

Actualmente reside en la ciudad de Seattle, en el noroeste del pa\u00eds.\n clic Lea tambi\u00e9n: Tribunal de apelaciones declara culpable a Knox\nPoco despu\u00e9s de conocerse el veredicto que la condena a 28 a\u00f1os y medio de c\u00e1rcel, la estadounidense emiti\u00f3 un comunicado desde Seattle en el que dice que est\u00e1 \"entristecida y asustada\".\n An\u00e1lisis, David Willis, BBC Washington Desde su puesta en libertad en octubre de 2011, Amanda Knox ha intentado retomar su vida donde la dej\u00f3.\n De regreso a la comunidad en la que creci\u00f3 en las afueras de Seattle, Knox se matricul\u00f3 de nuevo en la Universidad de Washington para estudiar escritura creativa y, excepto una breve serie de entrevistas para promocionar su autobiograf\u00eda titulada \"Esperando a ser escuchada\", ha intentado pasar inadvertida.\n Pero por mucho que haya buscado el anonimato, Knox sigue siendo fuente constante de fascinaci\u00f3n para la prensa sensacionalista que sigue todos sus pasos.\n Knox rechaz\u00f3 regresar a Italia para el nuevo juicio, citando lo que en su blog calific\u00f3 de \"humo y espejos\" de la fiscal\u00eda, pero contin\u00faa defendiendo su inocencia, y escribe: \"No soy una asesina, no mat\u00e9 a Meredith ni particip\u00e9 en su muerte, ni tengo conocimiento previo o especial de lo que sucedi\u00f3 aquella noche.  Yo no estaba all\u00ed y no tuve nada que ver con ello\".\n Knox asegura que Rudy Guede, un traficante de drogas que cumple 16 a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n por la muerte de Kercher, actu\u00f3 solo.\n \"Habiendo sido declarada inocente antes, esperaba algo mejor del sistema de justicia italiano\", dijo Knox en el comunicado.\n El largo camino de la extradici\u00f3n El fallo del tribunal pone en el tapete la extradici\u00f3n de Knox a Italia, quien rehus\u00f3 ir a ese pa\u00eds para seguir el proceso.\n Sin embargo, el veredicto de este jueves debe ser confirmado por el Tribunal Supremo para hacerse oficial -ya que habr\u00e1 impugnaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan anunciaron ya los abogados de Knox- un proceso que puede tomar meses.\n El corresponsal de BBC en Washington, Taylor Brown, dice que Italia probablemente presentar\u00e1 una solicitud de extradici\u00f3n para traer a Amanda Knox de vuelta.\n Seg\u00fan la prensa italiana, aunque es posible, no est\u00e1 claro que EE.UU. acceda a extraditar a Knox a Italia.\n Knox ha dicho que su \"sentido com\u00fan\" le sugiere no volver a Italia por voluntad propia, a pesar de su profesada inocencia.\n Stephen Vladeck, profesor de Derecho de la Universidad Americana en Washington DC, dijo a la BBC que el que Amanda Knox sea extraditada a Italia o no, es una cuesti\u00f3n que depender\u00e1 de los fundamentos jur\u00eddicos de la solicitud y del inter\u00e9s pol\u00edtico de EE.UU. en el caso.\n Una vez que Italia presente una solicitud, EE.UU. tendr\u00e1 que decidir si el caso recae bajo su tratado de extradici\u00f3n, explica Vladeck.\n \" El que Amanda Knox sea extraditada a Italia o no, es una cuesti\u00f3n de la base jur\u00eddica de la solicitud y del inter\u00e9s pol\u00edtico de EE.UU. en el caso.  \"\nStephen Vladeck - Universidad Americana\nAun cuando no hay \"ninguna raz\u00f3n para pensar que EE.UU. tiene un inter\u00e9s espec\u00edfico\" en bloquear la extradici\u00f3n, Vladeck dice que los pa\u00edses pueden efectivamente trancar el camino, mediante una variedad de interpretaciones \"creativas\" de los tratados de extradici\u00f3n.\n Si EE.UU. concede la petici\u00f3n de Italia, Knox puede luchar contra su extradici\u00f3n en una corte de EE.UU., citando entre otras cosas normas internacionales de derechos humanos.\n Pero Vladeck piensa que en este caso no se aplica el principio conocido como double jeopardy -o la cosa juzgada- un derecho contemplado en la legislaci\u00f3n estadounidense que estipula que un acusado no puede ser enjuiciado dos veces por un mismo delito.\n \"No hay nada en el tratado que obligue a Italia a ce\u00f1irse al sistema legal de EE.U UU\", concluye Vladeck.\n clic clic Lea tambi\u00e9n: El futuro que le espera a Amanda Knox",

El Supremo italiano anul\u00f3 el a\u00f1o pasado la sentencia absolutoria, dictaminada por un tribunal que integraban seis vecinos de Perugia y dos magistrados, y orden\u00f3 que se repitiera todo el proceso.  Knox, compa\u00f1era de piso de la v\u00edctima, no ha regresado a Italia y su condena podr\u00eda provocar un entuerto diplom\u00e1tico para EE UU si ella decidiera luchar contra su extradici\u00f3n.\n Knox y Sollecito fueron inicialmente condenados a 26 y 25 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel, respectivamente, por la violaci\u00f3n y asesinato -- los forenses identificaron 43 pu\u00f1aladas en su cad\u00e1ver -- de Kercher, que ten\u00eda 21 a\u00f1os.  Los familiares de la estudiante brit\u00e1nica y la fiscal\u00eda de Perugia recurrieron la absoluci\u00f3n de Knox y su novio, alegando que el tribunal no hab\u00eda tenido en cuenta el 70% de los elementos de prueba.  El veredicto de octubre de 2011 se emiti\u00f3 en un clima de presi\u00f3n medi\u00e1tica y pol\u00edtica que llev\u00f3 a la entonces secretaria de Estado de EE UU, Hilary Clinton, a interesarse por su compatriota.\n Si ambos vuelven a ser declarados culpables -- la acusaci\u00f3n pide 30 a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n para Knox y 26 para Sollecito -- podr\u00edan recurrir al Supremo.  Los instructores del caso encontraron ADN del novio en un sujetador de Kercher, as\u00ed como restos de sangre y pisadas de Knox en el piso que compart\u00edan, pruebas que fundamentaron su condena en 2009.  Sin embargo, el veredicto de 2011 cuestion\u00f3 los mecanismos empleados para obtener las muestras.  Rudy Guede, un amigo com\u00fan natural de Costa de Marfil que les acompa\u00f1\u00f3 aquella noche, ha sido condenado en un proceso separado a 16 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel.\n Knox, que ahora tiene 26 a\u00f1os y reside en Seattle -- se march\u00f3 apenas unas horas despu\u00e9s de su puesta en libertad -- ha mandado un escrito de cinco p\u00e1ginas al tribunal para justificar su negativa a regresar a Italia: \"Yo no viol\u00e9, no rob\u00e9, no plane\u00e9, no instigu\u00e9 y no mat\u00e9 a Meredith.  No estoy presente en la corte porque tengo miedo de que la vehemencia de la acusaci\u00f3n les impresione, que el humo entre en sus ojos y les ciegue\".\n Sollecito, de 29 a\u00f1os, sigue en Italia y dijo en noviembre que \"no ten\u00eda sentido\" que le estuvieran procesando por \"una atrocidad como esa\".  Esperar\u00e1 en su domicilio el veredicto, seg\u00fan informa AFP a instancias de su padre.  Quienes s\u00ed estar\u00e1n presentes en la corte ser\u00e1n los familiares de la estudiante brit\u00e1nica.",

El nuevo juicio es la consecuencia de la anulaci\u00f3n, el a\u00f1o pasado, de su absoluci\u00f3n por parte de un tribunal de casaci\u00f3n.\n Knox y Sollecito, fueron condenados en primera instancia en 2009 a 26 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel por el asesinato de Kercher, cuyo cuerpo semidesnudo fue encontrado en un charco de sangre en la casa que compart\u00eda en Perugia con la estudiante estadounidense.\n Seg\u00fan los fiscales, el crimen fue la consecuencia de un juego sexual que termin\u00f3 en tragedia por la rivalidad entre Knox y la v\u00edctima.\n En 2011, en el juicio en apelaci\u00f3n, ambos fueron absueltos del crimen.  Pero dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, en marzo 2013, ese veredicto fue anulado por el tribunal de casaci\u00f3n.\n Tras ser liberada, Knox regres\u00f3 a Seattle y no volvi\u00f3 a presentarse ante la justicia italiana porque no quer\u00eda ponerse \"entre las manos de los que quieren enviarme a prisi\u00f3n por algo que no hice\", dijo en una entrevista reciente a The New York Times.\n Este jueves, tras el veredicto, Knox dijo estar \"asustada y triste\"\n\"Estoy asustada y triste por este injusto veredicto.  Ya me hab\u00edan declarado inocente y esperaba algo mejor de la justicia italiana\", dijo en un comunicado.\n \"Las pruebas y la teor\u00eda acusatoria no justifican un veredicto m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de una duda razonable.  Sin embargo, nada ha cambiado.  Siempre ha habido una evidente falta de pruebas.  Mi familia y yo hemos sufrido mucho por esta injusta persecuci\u00f3n\", continu\u00f3.\n En la madrugada del 2 noviembre de 2007, Meredith Kercher, de 21 a\u00f1os, fue hallada semidesnuda en un charco de sangre en el apartamento que compart\u00eda con Knox en Perugia, una ciudad universitaria medieval del centro de Italia.\n El cuerpo de la v\u00edctima ten\u00eda marcas de haber sido acuchillado 47 veces y la autopsia demostr\u00f3 que Kercher, una estudiante de la universidad de Leeds, tambi\u00e9n fue violada.\n Tras el fallo de este jueves es poco probable que Knox sea extraditada desde Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan los expertos, incluso si se confirma la condena en el tribunal supremo.",

Ahora se espera que la justicia italiana pida su extradici\u00f3n, lo que seg\u00fan los observadores dif\u00edcilmente ocurrir\u00e1.\n En el aula tambi\u00e9n estaban presentes Stephanie y Lyle Kercher, hermanos de la v\u00edctima, acompa\u00f1ados de sus abogados.\n Por ahora Sollecito no podr\u00e1 salir del pa\u00eds, mientras su abogada, Giulia Bongiorno anunci\u00f3 que impugnar\u00e1n la sentencia.\n Meredith, que compart\u00eda el departamento de estudiante con Amanda, fue asesinada la noche del primero de noviembre de 2007, aparentemente porque se neg\u00f3 a participar en una org\u00eda de sexo y drogas.\n Hasta ahora el \u00fanico encarcelado por el crimen es Rudy Guede, originario de Costa de Marfil, que en un proceso paralelo fue sentenciado a 16 a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n.\n A la lectura de la sentencia asisti\u00f3 Patrick Lumumba, un m\u00fasico residente en Perugia y originario de la Rep\u00fablica del Congo, a quien Knox acus\u00f3 inicialmente del delito, pero que tras ser absuelto la demand\u00f3 por difamaci\u00f3n.\n Knok tambi\u00e9n fue demandada por calumnia por varios polic\u00edas, a los que acus\u00f3 de haberla golpeado mientras estaba detenida en la c\u00e9rcel de Perugia.\n El caso inspir\u00f3 varios libros y una pel\u00edcula para televisi\u00f3n titulada Amanda Knox, dirigida por Robert Dornhelm.",

Los hechos ocurrieron en Perugia, en el centro de Italia.  Seg\u00fan la reconstrucci\u00f3n de los hechos realizada por los fiscales, Kercher fue apu\u00f1alada por negarse a participar del juego.

Knox y Raffaele Sollecito esperan el veredicto que determinar\u00e1 su presunta culpabilidad este jueves.\n Sin embargo, la pareja no estar\u00e1 en la corte para escuchar la decisi\u00f3n, sino a miles de kil\u00f3metros de distancia en EU, a donde llegaron luego de que una corte de apelaciones diera marcha atr\u00e1s con el caso en 2009.\n \"Me convertir\u00e9 .. .  en fugitiva\", le dijo este mes Knox al diario italiano La Repubblica, cuando se le pregunt\u00f3 qu\u00e9 har\u00eda si es declarada culpable\".\n El cuerpo semidesnudo de Kercher, de entonces 21 a\u00f1os, fue encontrado con la garganta cortada en la casa que compart\u00eda en ese entonces con Knox en Perugia, Italia.\n Desde entonces, el caso ha atra\u00eddo la atenci\u00f3n del p\u00fablico en EU, Gran Breta\u00f1a e Italia, sobre todo por la fascinaci\u00f3n ante las versiones encontradas y las preguntas sobre la verdadera actitud de Amanda Knox.\n Un sue\u00f1o se convierte en pesadilla\nLa hermana de Amanda Knox, Deanna, la describe como una joven que hizo lo posible por irse a estudiar a la Universidad de Extranjeros de Perugia, y convertir un sue\u00f1o en realidad.\n Poco despu\u00e9s de que Amanda se instal\u00f3 en una villa de cuatro habitaciones con vistas a un peque\u00f1o valle, Meredith Kercher se mud\u00f3 a compartir alojamiento con ella y se hicieron amigas.  Semanas despu\u00e9s, esa casa se convertir\u00eda en la escena de un crimen, en el que Kerchner falleci\u00f3 y Knox qued\u00f3 como la principal sospechosa del asesinato.\n Los fiscales en Perugia dijeron que Knox dio instrucciones a su entonces novio, Raffaele Sollecito y a otro hombre al que gustaba, Rudy Guede, de sostener a Kechner antes de que Knox le cortara la garganta.\n Tanto Knox como Sollecito fueron detenidos en 2009 y sentenciados a largos periodos en la c\u00e1rcel.  Guede, un vagabundo de Costa de Marf\u00edl, fue enjuicidado por separado y actualmente cumple una sentencia de 16 a\u00f1os.\n Despu\u00e9s de que la evidencia se revisara, una corte de apelaciones anul\u00f3 la detenci\u00f3n de los estudiantes en octubre de 2011, citando una falta de pruebas en su contra, por lo que ambos fueron liberados.  El caso revivir\u00e1 17 meses despu\u00e9s frente a una corte de apelaciones de Florencia.\n Raffaele Sollecito ya public\u00f3 sus memorias sobre el caso, tituladas Atado por el honor: mi viaje al infierno y de regreso con Amanda Knox.  En este libro, Sollecito dice que se sent\u00eda incomodo con el \"comportamiento extra\u00f1o\" de Amanda despu\u00e9s de la muerte de Kechner, e indica que los fiscales usaron esto en contra de ambos.  El recuento completo de los hechos seg\u00fan Amanda Knox no se conoce hasta ahora.\n Las dos versiones sobre Knox\nAlgunos periodistas han pintado una imagen de Amanda Knox como una estudiante demasiado confiada y algunos apuntan que la guiaron mal en el sistema judicial de Italia.  Otros medios la presentan como una joven silenciosa y manipuladora, que intenta salirse con la suya.\n Los amigos y familiares de Knox dicen que no hay nada en su pasado que indique que fuera capaz de matar a alguien, mucho menos a una amiga.  Uno de sus amigos dijo a CNN que Knox era la clase de persona que sacar\u00eda a una ara\u00f1a de la casa en lugar de matarla.\n Knox mostr\u00f3 inter\u00e9s desde peque\u00f1a por aprender otros idiomas y experimentar diferentes culturas, seg\u00fan su madre, Edda Mellas.  Amanda consider\u00f3 irse a estudiar a Escocia, Austria y Alemania antes de decidirse por Italia, un pa\u00eds al que nunca hab\u00eda ido y en donde hablan un idioma que ella no hab\u00eda estudiado.\n Al comenzar las clases, Knox envi\u00f3 correos electr\u00f3nicos a su familia sobre las actividades que realizaba con Kercher y Sollecito, el joven ingeniero que conoci\u00f3 en un concierto de m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sica.\n \"Estaba encantada con \u00e9l.  Primero porque era extranjero, dulce y muy amable e inteligente.  Exactamente, del tipo de mi hermana\", dijo Deanna Knox.  \"Era muy emocionante, yo quer\u00eda saber m\u00e1s sobre \u00e9l y s\u00f3lo llevaban dos semanas saliendo cuando todo sucedi\u00f3\".\n Sollecito, en el epilogo de su libro, dijo que hab\u00eda visitado a Knox en Seatlle despu\u00e9s de que fueron liberados, pero estaba nervioso porque no sab\u00eda si \"deb\u00edan vivir sus vidas y dejarse en paz\".  A\u00fan no est\u00e1 claro si ambos aparecer\u00e1n en la corte juntos una vez m\u00e1s.",

En el segundo juicio del c\u00e9lebre crimen de Perugia, despu\u00e9s de que el Supremo italiano anulara la absoluci\u00f3n del primero y ordenara repetirlo, la estadounidense Amanda Knox fue considerada culpable del asesinato de la brit\u00e1nica Meredith Kercher, de 22 a\u00f1os, en noviembre de 2007 en un piso de estudiantes.\n La joven, que estaba en Italia con una beca Erasmus, muri\u00f3 de una cuchillada en la garganta.  El otro acusado, novio de Knox por entonces, Raffaelle Sollecito, italiano, fue condenado a 25 a\u00f1os.  La sentencia recoge casi en pleno la petici\u00f3n del fiscal, que ha explicado el crimen como resultado de las malas relaciones entre compa\u00f1eras de apartamento y no, como en el primer juicio, con un juego er\u00f3tico que termin\u00f3 mal.  El detonante habr\u00eda sido una discusi\u00f3n a altas horas de la madrugada sobre la limpieza de la casa.\n Sollecito estaba en la sala, aunque al final la abandon\u00f3 en la larga espera de la sentencia, que se retras\u00f3 hasta las diez de la noche.  Knox, en cambio, recibi\u00f3 la noticia en su casa de Seattle, en Estados Unidos, y no tiene intenci\u00f3n de volver a Italia, donde ya pas\u00f3 cuatro a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel.  \"Estoy asustada y triste\", declar\u00f3 al conocer el fallo.  El tribunal orden\u00f3 retirar el pasaporte a Sollecito para evitar el riesgo de fuga.\n Hace unos meses, tras la petici\u00f3n fiscal, se fue a la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, pa\u00eds sin convenios de extradici\u00f3n con Italia, aunque luego opt\u00f3 por regresar.  Es dudoso que vuelva Amanda Knox, pero, de momento y hasta la sentencia firme, no est\u00e1 obligada.  A la espera de la apelaci\u00f3n, sigue un culebr\u00f3n que ha tenido mucho eco por la gran atenci\u00f3n de los medios norteamericanos, por lo misterioso del caso y tambi\u00e9n porque Knox es mona y ha sido retratada como un personaje diab\u00f3lico.  \"Soy distinta a como me han pintado\", insisti\u00f3 ayer en una \u00faltima entrevista.  La historia ya tiene hasta una pel\u00edcula.",

La Corte Suprema les dio la raz\u00c3\u00b3n y orden\u00c3\u00b3 el nuevo proceso concluido hoy ante la Corte de Apelaciones de Florencia.\n Por la ma\u00c3\u00b1ana de este jueves Sollecito, acompa\u00c3\u00b1ado de familiares, estuvo presente en el aula, a la que no regres\u00c3\u00b3 para la lectura de la sentencia.\n Knox anunci\u00c3\u00b3 desde su residencia de Seattle que no se presentar\u00c3\u00ada pues tem\u00c3\u00ada que los jueces fueran 'cegados'y la condenaran nuevamente.  Ahora se espera que la justicia italiana pida su extradici\u00c3\u00b3n, lo que seg\u00c3\u00ban los observadores dif\u00c3\u00adcilmente ocurrir\u00c3\u00a1.\n En el aula tambi\u00c3\u00a9n estaban presentes Stephanie y Lyle Kercher, hermanos de la v\u00c3\u00adctima, acompa\u00c3\u00b1ados de sus abogados.\n Por ahora Sollecito no podr\u00c3\u00a1 salir del pa\u00c3\u00ads, mientras su abogada, Giulia Bongiorno anunci\u00c3\u00b3 que impugnar\u00c3\u00a1n la sentencia.\n Meredith, que compart\u00c3\u00ada el departamento de estudiante con Amanda, fue asesinada la noche del primero de noviembre de 2007, aparentemente porque se neg\u00c3\u00b3 a participar en una org\u00c3\u00ada de sexo y drogas.\n Hasta ahora el \u00c3\u00banico encarcelado por el crimen es Rudy Guede, originario de Costa de Marfil, que en un proceso paralelo fue sentenciado a 16 a\u00c3\u00b1os de prisi\u00c3\u00b3n.\n A la lectura de la sentencia asisti\u00c3\u00b3 Patrick Lumumba, un m\u00c3\u00basico residente en Perugia y originario de la Rep\u00c3\u00bablica del Congo, a quien Knox acus\u00c3\u00b3 inicialmente del delito, pero que tras ser absuelto la demand\u00c3\u00b3 por difamaci\u00c3\u00b3n.\n Knok tambi\u00c3\u00a9n fue demandada por calumnia por varios polic\u00c3\u00adas, a los que acus\u00c3\u00b3 de haberla golpeado mientras estaba detenida en la c\u00c3\u00a9rcel de Perugia.\n El caso inspir\u00c3\u00b3 varios libros y una pel\u00c3\u00adcula para televisi\u00c3\u00b3n titulada 'Amanda Knox', dirigida por Robert Dornhelm.",

                    "body": "Obama nombra al vicealmirante de la Armada, nuevo jefe de la NSA\nEstados Unidos tendr\u00eda pocos argumentos para negar la extradici\u00f3n a Italia de la estudiante estadounidense Amanda Knox, condenada de nuevo este jueves en juicio de apelaci\u00f3n por el asesinato de Meredith Kercher en 2007.\n \"Si esta decisi\u00f3n es confirmada, creo que ella ser\u00e1 extradita a Italia\", afirm\u00f3 a la AFP el profesor de derecho de Harvard, Alan Dershowitz, mientras que los abogados de la joven anunciaron su intenci\u00f3n de recurrir a la Corte Suprema de Italia.\n El tribunal de apelaciones de Florencia conden\u00f3 el jueves a Knox y a su exnovio italiano Raffaele Sollecito a 28 a\u00f1os y seis meses y a 25 a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n, respectivamente.  En 2009, en un fallo de primera instancia, Knox y Sollecito fueron condenados en primera instancia a 26 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel.  La joven estadounidense permaneci\u00f3 cuatro a\u00f1os en una c\u00e1rcel de Italia.\n Sin embargo, en 2011, en el juicio en apelaci\u00f3n, ambos fueron absueltos del crimen, que entonces fue atribuido a un juego sexual que termin\u00f3 mal.  Pero dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, en marzo de 2013, ese veredicto fue anulado por el tribunal de casaci\u00f3n y el caso volvi\u00f3 a juicio.\n El cuerpo de Kercher, de origen brit\u00e1nico, fue encontrado semidesnudo en un charco de sangre en la casa que compart\u00eda en Perugia, Italia, con la estudiante estadounidense.  Knox, de 26 a\u00f1os, quien sigui\u00f3 el proceso desde Seattle, su ciudad natal, dijo sentirse \"asustada y triste por el injusto veredicto\".\n El \"sistema judicial italiano, a pesar de que no me gusta es un sistema leg\u00edtimo.  Tenemos un tratado (de extradici\u00f3n) con Italia y no veo c\u00f3mo se puede rechazar,\" afirm\u00f3 el profesor Dershowitz.  \"Estados Unidos es el pa\u00eds que m\u00e1s extradita en el mundo\", y viceversa , \"que requiere la mayor cantidad de extradiciones\", precis\u00f3.\n \"Estamos buscando traer (al exanalista de la NSA Edward) Snowden, \u00bfc\u00f3mo se ver\u00eda demandar la extradici\u00f3n de Snowden, pero negar la misma a una joven acusada de asesinato?\", insisti\u00f3 Dershowitz.  Knox tiene el derecho de tomar acciones legales en contra de su extradici\u00f3n, \"pero las posibilidades de \u00e9xito no son muy grandes\", dijo de su lado el profesor de Derecho Internacional de la Universidad de Hofstra, Julian Ku.\n Si hubiera una solicitud de extradici\u00f3n de la justicia italiana, el Departamento de Estado debe trasladar la petici\u00f3n al Departamento de Justicia para proceder al arresto y detenci\u00f3n de la joven.\n \"La \u00faltima palabra la tiene el Departamento de Estado\", dijo Ku, \"\u00e9ste puede decir que el juicio no se basa en s\u00f3lidos principios de la justicia\", pero deber\u00eda tener \"elementos muy fuertes para bloquear la extradici\u00f3n\", dijo el experto, quien \"nunca tuvo la impresi\u00f3n de que el juicio fue injusto\".  Sin embargo, para que todo esto ocurra debe haber un pedido oficial de extradici\u00f3n por parte de Italia.\n El profesor de Derecho de la Universidad Americana en Washington DC, Stephen Vladeck, ha se\u00f1alado a la BBC que lo m\u00e1s probable es que Italia presente una solicitud de extradici\u00f3n para traer a Amanda Knox de vuelta.  \"Que Amanda Knox sea extraditada a Italia o no, es una cuesti\u00f3n que depender\u00e1 de los fundamentos jur\u00eddicos de la solicitud y del inter\u00e9s pol\u00edtico de EEUU en el caso.  Una vez que Italia presente una solicitud, EE.UU. tendr\u00e1 que decidir si el caso recae bajo su tratado de extradici\u00f3n\", explica Vladeck.\n \"El que Amanda Knox sea extraditada a Italia o no, es una cuesti\u00f3n de la base jur\u00eddica de la solicitud y del inter\u00e9s pol\u00edtico de EE.UU. en el caso\".  Aun cuando no hay \"ninguna raz\u00f3n para pensar que EE.UU. tiene un inter\u00e9s espec\u00edfico\" en bloquear la extradici\u00f3n, Vladeck dice que los pa\u00edses pueden efectivamente trancar el camino, mediante una variedad de interpretaciones \"creativas\" de los tratados de extradici\u00f3n.\n Si EE.UU. concede la petici\u00f3n de Italia, Knox puede luchar contra su extradici\u00f3n en una corte de EEUU, citando entre otras cosas normas internacionales de derechos humanos.  Pero Vladeck piensa que en este caso no se aplica el principio conocido como double jeopardy, o la cosa juzgada, un derecho contemplado en la legislaci\u00f3n estadounidense que estipula que un acusado no puede ser enjuiciado dos veces por un mismo delito.  \"No hay nada en el tratado que obligue a Italia a ce\u00f1irse al sistema legal de EE.U UU\", concluye Vladec",
