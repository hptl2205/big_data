                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has confirmed the president's choice to run the Pentagon.\n\nThe vote Thursday was 93-5 for Ash Carter. He'll replace Chuck Hagel and be Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years.\n\nCarter faces the unenviable task of steering the military as the United States battles Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, and deals with crises in Ukraine and the drawdown of the war in Afghanistan.\n\nHis confirmation comes as Republicans and Democrats have reacted negatively to the president's draft proposal for authorizing force against the extremists.\n\nThe 60-year-old Carter is a physicist by training. He served as the Pentagon's No. 2 official from 2011 to 2013.\n\nHagel struggled with Obama's insular group of national security advisers. He announced in November he was stepping down.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's choice to run the Pentagon earned the support Thursday of the Senate's top Republican, who called on the nominee to \"speak truth to power\" to both Congress and the commander in chief.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would back the nomination of Ashton Carter, who would be Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years. The 60-year-old Carter, a physicist by training, is on track to secure Senate confirmation.\n\nIn offering his endorsement, McConnell said Obama administration policies have weakened the country's ability to battle al-Qaida and its affiliates, the Taliban and the Islamic State group. He said Obama has been inflexible about breaking his campaign promises to draw down forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and close the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that holds suspected terrorists.\n\n\"If I could place one demand on him,\" McConnell said of Carter, \"it would be to leave his successor with our armed forces in a better position to deal with global threats than they are today.\"\n\nMcConnell said his support for Carter is conditioned on this question: \"The incoming secretary needs to have the courage to speak truth to power - to Congress, yes, but also to his commander in chief.\"\n\nWhile moving ahead on Carter, Senate Republicans delayed a committee vote on Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee for attorney general. Lawmakers said they had more questions for Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York who would become the nation's first black female attorney general if confirmed.\n\nDemocrats complained that Lynch is being held to a double standard compared to other nominees and said her nomination should be approved immediately. Her confirmation is expected after Congress' one-week recess.\n\nCarter would replace Chuck Hagel, the Vietnam War veteran and former Republican senator from Nebraska who struggled with Obama's tight-knit group of national security advisers.\n\nCarter served as the Pentagon's second-ranking official from 2011 to 2013, spent two years previously as the department's technology and weapons-buying chief and was assistant secretary of defense for international security policy during Bill Clinton's administration.\n\nAs defense secretary, he will face the unenviable task of steering the military as the United States tries to defeat Islamic State militants, stop Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine and wind down the war in Afghanistan. He also will face smaller Pentagon budgets.\n\nHis expected Senate confirmation comes as the administration is seeking new congressional authority for its military campaign against the Islamic extremists.\n\nWhile he has the resume for the job, it's unclear whether Carter would find more success than Hagel in jelling with Obama's inner circle. The president's relationship with the Pentagon has often been strained.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, alluded to that divide on Thursday in reiterating his support for Carter, saying he would cast his vote with \"sincere hope and, sadly, little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\nAt his confirmation hearing last week, McCain told Carter he hoped he would push back on any attempt by the White House to micromanage the Defense Department, or over-centralize U.S. foreign and defense policies.\n\n\"I'll be entirely straight and upfront with the president and make my advice as cogent and useful to him in making his decisions as I can,\" Carter promised.\n\nCarter told the committee he was inclined to support providing defensive lethal aid to Ukrainians battling Russian-backed separatists. He also said he would consider recommending a change of plans for withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 if security conditions worsen. About 10,600 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan.\n\nCarter said 2,106 American service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Finishing the job there is very important,\" he said.",

                    "body": "President Barack Obama's choice to run the Pentagon earned the support Thursday of the Senate's top Republican, who called on the nominee to \"speak truth to power\" to both Congress and the commander in chief.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would back the nomination of Ashton Carter, who would be Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years. The 60-year-old Carter, a physicist by training, is on track to secure Senate confirmation.\n\nIn offering his endorsement, McConnell said Obama administration policies have weakened the country's ability to battle al-Qaida and its affiliates, the Taliban and the Islamic State group. He said Obama has been inflexible about breaking his campaign promises to draw down forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and close the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that holds suspected terrorists.\n\n\"If I could place one demand on him,\" McConnell said of Carter, \"it would be to leave his successor with our armed forces in a better position to deal with global threats than they are today.\"\n\nMcConnell said his support for Carter is conditioned on this question: \"The incoming secretary needs to have the courage to speak truth to power -- to Congress, yes, but also to his commander in chief.\"\n\nWhile moving ahead on Carter, Senate Republicans delayed a committee vote on Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee for attorney general. Lawmakers said they had more questions for Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York who would become the nation's first black female attorney general if confirmed.\n\nDemocrats complained that Lynch is being held to a double standard compared to other nominees and said her nomination should be approved immediately. Her confirmation is expected after Congress' one-week recess.\n\nCarter would replace Chuck Hagel, the Vietnam War veteran and former Republican senator from Nebraska who struggled with Obama's tight-knit group of national security advisers.\n\nCarter served as the Pentagon's second-ranking official from 2011 to 2013, spent two years previously as the department's technology and weapons-buying chief and was assistant secretary of defense for international security policy during Bill Clinton's administration.\n\nAs defense secretary, he will face the unenviable task of steering the military as the United States tries to defeat Islamic State militants, stop Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine and wind down the war in Afghanistan. He also will face smaller Pentagon budgets.\n\nHis expected Senate confirmation comes as the administration is seeking new congressional authority for its military campaign against the Islamic extremists.\n\nWhile he has the resume for the job, it's unclear whether Carter would find more success than Hagel in jelling with Obama's inner circle. The president's relationship with the Pentagon has often been strained.\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, alluded to that divide on Thursday in reiterating his support for Carter, saying he would cast his vote with \"sincere hope and, sadly, little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\nAt his confirmation hearing last week, McCain told Carter he hoped he would push back on any attempt by the White House to micromanage the Defense Department, or over-centralize U.S. foreign and defense policies.\n\n\"I'll be entirely straight and upfront with the president and make my advice as cogent and useful to him in making his decisions as I can,\" Carter promised.\n\nCarter told the committee he was inclined to support providing defensive lethal aid to Ukrainians battling Russian-backed separatists. He also said he would consider recommending a change of plans for withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 if security conditions worsen. About 10,600 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan.\n\nCarter said 2,106 American service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Finishing the job there is very important,\" he said.",

Carter will replace Chuck Hagel, the former Republican senator who had a rough relationship with Obama's insular group of national security advisers.\n\nCarter will be Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years, joining a line of succession that began with Robert Gates and included Leon Panetta and Hagel. In a statement, Obama welcomed the bipartisan vote and Carter's return to the president's national security team.\n\nOne of Carter's first tasks will be helping to win support for Obama's call to Congress for new authority to use force against the IS extremists. Republicans and Democrats have reacted negatively to Obama's draft proposal, criticizing both its limitations and vagueness.\n\nIn endorsing the 60-year-old Carter, Republicans expressed little hope that he would have better success in jelling with Obama's inner circle than Hagel did. The former Republican senator and Vietnam War veteran was often the outsider and he announced in November he was stepping down.\n\nThe president's relationship with the Pentagon has often been strained.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who backed Carter, said he \"needs to have the courage to speak truth to power -- to Congress, yes, but also to his commander in chief.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, alluded to the divide between the White House and Pentagon, saying he had \"sincere hope and, sadly, little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\nWhile moving ahead on Carter, Senate Republicans delayed a committee vote on Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee for attorney general. Lawmakers said they had more questions for Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York who would become the nation's first black female attorney general if confirmed.\n\nDemocrats complained that Lynch is being held to a double standard compared to other nominees and said her nomination should be approved immediately. Her confirmation is expected after Congress' one-week recess.\n\nCarter served as the Pentagon's second-ranking official from 2011 to 2013, spent two years previously as the department's technology and weapons-buying chief and was assistant secretary of defense for international security policy during Bill Clinton's administration.

Armenpress reports, citing the USA Today that Carter, 60, succeeds Chuck Hagel who never really recovered from a bruising confirmation fight in 2013. Carter, by contrast, easily navigated his confirmation hearing and won unanimous support from the Armed Services Committee. \"Ash Carter served as a key leader of our national security team in the first years of my presidency, and with his overwhelming bipartisan confirmation by the Senate today, I'm proud to welcome him back as our next secretary of Defense,\" President Obama said in a statement. A physicist by training, Carter has served under 11 Defense secretaries and most recently was the No. 2 official there. President Obama passed him over in favor of Hagel two years ago, but returned to him after Hagel offered his resignation under pressure in November. Hagel was confirmed by a partisan 58-41 vote in 2013. Senate approval for Carter was nearly a foregone conclusion after the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain, R-Ariz., and Jack Reed, D-R.I., offered strong support for him prior to the vote. \"I think Dr. Carter will be a good secretary of Defense, who will always keep faith with our men and women in uniform and work tirelessly on their behalf and that of our national security,\" McCain said Thursday. Carter, Reed said, \"is the right leader at the right time\" for the Defense Department. Last week, Carter told the committee that he was open to reconsidering the pace of withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, scheduled for the end of 2016, and that he was inclined to send lethal aid to Ukraine to help it defend its borders from Russian-backed separatists. Both stands could put him at odds with the White House. McCain, however, questioned whether Carter could withstand \"micromanagement\" from the White House. Former Defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates complained late last year of undue meddling by White House aides. However, Gates, in a recent interview with USA TODAY, said Carter is well qualified to lead the Pentagon. Carter's relationship with Obama and White House officials will serve him well, Gates said. \"The difference is that Ash has served more than five years with this administration,\" Gates said. \"So he knows this president; this president knows him. He knows all the players at multiple levels. They will be familiar to him, and he to them. That'll make a big difference in terms of working relationships.\"",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate Thursday voted to confirm Ashton Carter as the 25th secretary of defense, giving President Barack Obama his fourth Pentagon chief in six years at a time of turmoil from Iraq to Ukraine.\n\nCarter, 60, a physicist and veteran Pentagon official, was approved, 93-5, on Thursday in a show of support from both political parties. The smooth confirmation contrasted with the fight over his predecessor, departing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who stumbled over policy questions at his confirmation hearing and later had a falling out with White House aides that led to his departure.\n\nCarter will inherit an array of defense and foreign policy challenges that are likely to help define the remaining two years of Obama's presidency. He must guide the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan when many military officers and some members of Congress want to slow it. He also will be a central figure in the debate over Obama's request for congressional authorization for the war against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"It's a blessing for the White House that Ash Carter is being confirmed before this debate starts,\" said David Gergen, a former adviser to four presidents who's now a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"He could turn out to be a pivotal player because he enjoys the support of many Republicans in Congress.\"\n\nCarter also will have to negotiate conflicting views within the administration and Congress over whether to send weapons to Ukraine in its battle against Russian-backed separatists. He'll face opposition from Republicans if he recommends transferring more prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which Obama has vowed to close.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Carter \"a worthy choice\" who may have \"limited influence\" on defense policy because of White House micromanagement.\n\nMcCain, who voted for Carter, said on the Senate floor before the vote that he has \"little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\nCarter will have to champion the Pentagon's proposed $534.3 billion base budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, which exceeds by about $36 billion the budget caps known as sequestration that will resume unless Congress and the president reach an agreement to ease or repeal them.\n\nThe new defense secretary is expected to testify to Congress on the budget request early in March. Carter also will have a voice in replacing Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose term is up on Sept. 30.\n\nIn his new role, Carter won't have the independent political power base enjoyed by his three immediate predecessors. Robert Gates was a Central Intelligence Agency director and Pentagon chief under President George W. Bush. Leon Panetta also was a former CIA director, as well as White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and a onetime House Budget Committee chairman. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, won two Purple Hearts in the Vietnam War.\n\nAll three of them have complained of micromanagement by the Obama White House. Carter witnessed the tensions while serving as the deputy defense secretary under both Panetta and Hagel. Before that, he served under Gates as the military's top weapons buyer.\n\n\"Public service at senior levels in Washington is a little bit like being a Christian in the Coliseum,\" Carter wrote in a short autobiography for the Kennedy School, where he's been a faculty member. \"You never know when they are going to release the lions and have you torn apart for the amusement of onlookers.\"\n\nAt his confirmation hearing, Carter struck a respectful but independent tone that suggested he may stray from some White House positions.\n\nWhile Obama has resisted providing arms to Ukraine, Carter said he's \"very much inclined\" to supply some weapons. He also said he'd be willing to recommend slowing Obama's timetable for a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan if \"I ascertain as the years go by that we need to change that plan.\"\n\nHe also pledged to resist any potential White House pressure to increase the pace of prisoner transfers from Guantanamo.\n\nA former Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, where he earned a doctorate in theoretical physics, Carter's involvement in defense policy dates to Cold War-era debates over the MX nuclear missile. He joined a team of scientists analyzing the system for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment in 1979, according to his autobiography.\n\nSince then, he has cycled mostly between positions in government and academia, serving as chairman of the Kennedy School's International and Global Affairs faculty.\n\nAfter leaving his post as the Pentagon's No. 2 civilian leader in December 2013, he became a senior executive at the New York-based Markle Foundation, which seeks to use emerging technology to improve national security and health care, according to its website.\n\n_ With assistance from Mike Dorning, Kathleen Hunter and Tony Capaccio in Washington.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Chicago Tribune",

He will replace Chuck Hagel, who resigned after less than two years on the job.\n\nCarter, a respected technocrat, has degrees in theoretical physics and medieval history from Yale and Oxford.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain of Arizona said Carter is one of the country's most respected defense professionals, respected by both the Republicans and the Democrats.\n\n\"I have no doubt the vote on Dr. Carter will be overwhelmingly favorable,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, in a floor speech. \"He served as the day-to-day financial officer at the Pentagon. So he is one of the few people that understands, really understands, the complexities of the Pentagon's budget.\"\n\nSen.

Republicans and Democrats have reacted negatively to Obama's draft proposal, criticizing both its limitations and vagueness.\n\nIn endorsing the 60-year-old Carter, Republicans expressed little hope that he would have better success in jelling with Obama's inner circle than Hagel did. The former Republican senator and Vietnam War veteran was often the outsider and he announced in November he was stepping down.\n\nThe president's relationship with the Pentagon has often been strained.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who backed Carter, said he \"needs to have the courage to speak truth to power - to Congress, yes, but also to his commander in chief.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, alluded to the divide between the White House and Pentagon, saying he had \"sincere hope and, sadly, little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\nWhile moving ahead on Carter, Senate Republicans delayed a committee vote on Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee for attorney general. Lawmakers said they had more questions for Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York who would become the nation's first black female attorney general if confirmed.\n\nDemocrats complained that Lynch is being held to a double standard compared to other nominees and said her nomination should be approved immediately. Her confirmation is expected after Congress' one-week recess.\n\nCarter served as the Pentagon's second-ranking official from 2011 to 2013, spent two years previously as the department's technology and weapons-buying chief and was assistant secretary of defense for international security policy during Bill Clinton's administration. He prefers to be called Ash rather than his given name, Ashton.\n\nThe next Pentagon chief faces a long to-do list for a military looking at reduced budgets and crises worldwide. The Islamic State group has claimed large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Russian-backed separatists threaten Ukraine. The war is winding down in Afghanistan after more than a decade of fighting, but there is widespread debate about whether the residual U.S. force is sufficient to protect gains.\n\nAt his confirmation hearing last week, McCain told Carter he hoped he would push back on any attempt by the White House to micromanage the Defense Department, or over-centralize U.S. foreign and defense policies.\n\n\"I'll be entirely straight and upfront with the president and make my advice as cogent and useful to him in making his decisions as I can,\" Carter promised.\n\nCarter told the committee he was inclined to support providing defensive lethal aid to Ukrainians battling Russian-backed separatists. He also said he would consider recommending a change of plans for withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 if security conditions worsen. About 10,600 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan.\n\nCarter said 2,106 American service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan. \"Finishing the job there is very important,\" he said.\n\nVoting against the nomination were Republican Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho, Mark Kirk of Illinois and John Boozman of Arkansas.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The Senate voted to confirm Ashton Carter as the 25th U.S. secretary of defense, giving President Barack Obama his fourth Pentagon chief in six years at a time of turmoil from Iraq to Ukraine.\n\nCarter, 60, a physicist and veteran Pentagon official, was approved, 93-5, on Thursday in a show of support from both political parties. The smooth confirmation contrasted with the fight over his predecessor, departing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who stumbled over policy questions at his confirmation hearing and later had a falling out with White House aides that led to his departure.\n\nCarter will inherit an array of defense and foreign policy challenges that are likely to help define the remaining two years of Obama's presidency. He must guide the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan when many military officers and some members of Congress want to slow it. He also will be a central figure in the debate over Obama's request for congressional authorization for the war against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"It's a blessing for the White House that Ash Carter is being confirmed before this debate starts,\" said David Gergen, a former adviser to four presidents who's now a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"He could turn out to be a pivotal player because he enjoys the support of many Republicans in Congress.\"\n\nUkraine Weapons\n\nCarter also will have to negotiate conflicting views within the administration and Congress over whether to send weapons to Ukraine in its battle against Russian-backed separatists. He'll face opposition from Republicans if he recommends transferring more prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which Obama has vowed to close.\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Carter \"a worthy choice\" who may have \"limited influence\" on defense policy because of White House micromanagement.\n\nMcCain, who voted for Carter, said on the Senate floor before the vote that he has \"little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\nCarter will have to champion the Pentagon's proposed $534.3 billion base budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, which exceeds by about $36 billion the budget caps known as sequestration that will resume unless Congress and the president reach an agreement to ease or repeal them.\n\nThe new defense secretary is expected to testify to Congress on the budget request early in March. Carter also will have a voice in replacing Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose term is up on Sept. 30.\n\nMicromanagement Complaint\n\nIn his new role, Carter won't have the independent political power base enjoyed by his three immediate predecessors. Robert Gates was a Central Intelligence Agency director and Pentagon chief under President George W. Bush. Leon Panetta also was a former CIA director, as well as White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and a onetime House Budget Committee chairman. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, won two Purple Hearts in the Vietnam War.\n\nAll three of them have complained of micromanagement by the Obama White House. Carter witnessed the tensions while serving as the deputy defense secretary under both Panetta and Hagel. Before that, he served under Gates as the military's top weapons buyer.\n\n\"Public service at senior levels in Washington is a little bit like being a Christian in the Coliseum,\" Carter wrote in a short autobiography for the Kennedy School, where he's been a faculty member. \"You never know when they are going to release the lions and have you torn apart for the amusement of onlookers.\"\n\nIndependent Tone\n\nAt his confirmation hearing, Carter struck a respectful but independent tone that suggested he may stray from some White House positions.\n\nWhile Obama has resisted providing arms to Ukraine, Carter said he's \"very much inclined\" to supply some weapons. He also said he'd be willing to recommend slowing Obama's timetable for a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan if \"I ascertain as the years go by that we need to change that plan.\"\n\nHe also pledged to resist any potential White House pressure to increase the pace of prisoner transfers from Guantanamo.\n\nA former Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University in the U.K., where he earned a doctorate in theoretical physics, Carter's involvement in defense policy dates to Cold War-era debates over the MX nuclear missile. He joined a team of scientists analyzing the system for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment in 1979, according to his autobiography.\n\nSince then, he has cycled mostly between positions in government and academia, serving as chairman of the Kennedy School's International and Global Affairs faculty.\n\nAfter leaving his post as the Pentagon's No. 2 civilian leader in December 2013, he became a senior executive at the New York-based Markle Foundation, which seeks to use emerging technology to improve national security and health care, according to its website.",

John McCain said on the Senate floor Thursday that Carter is \"one of America's most experienced defense professionals, respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.\"\n\n\"I think Dr. Carter will be a good Secretary of Defense, who will always keep faith with our men and women in uniform and work tirelessly on their behalf and that of our national security,\" he said.\n\nA physicist by training, Carter is now the fourth Pentagon chief to hold office during Obama's two-term presidency. Outgoing defense secretary Chuck Hagel resigned from office in November amid reports of strained relations with the White House's national security team, but has remained in office until the senate confirmed a successor.\n\nMcCain said he would back Carter's nomination \"with sincere hope and sadly little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"\n\n\"My support is conditioned on this request: the incoming Secretary needs to have the courage to speak truth to power. To Congress, yes. But also to his commander-in-chief,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nUpon entering his new role, the defense chief will be faced with a bevvy of issues at home and abroad. He will have to navigate an increasingly uncertain international security situation as budget cuts at the Defense Department put a premium on resources.\n\nAmong his top priorities will be pushing for Obama's recent war powers call to Congress to authorize force against ISIL. Capitol Hill has already strongly criticized the draft it received Wednesday.",

Five Republicans opposed Carter's confirmation.\n\nThe transition to a new Pentagon chief comes as Congress considers a number of pressing defense issues, including a request by Obama that would formally authorize military action against the Islamic State.\n\nRepublicans were cautious to draw the distinction between supporting Carter and supporting Obama, especially as many lawmakers expressed reservations about the parameters of the authorization regarding the use of ground troops and its place among an existing authorization for military action.\n\nMark Kirk, R-Ill., one of the five senators who voted against Carter, said, \"Mine is a vote of no confidence in the national security decisions of this administration.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Carter \"one of America's most experienced defense professionals.\" But he said he did not think Obama would put his full faith in Carter.\n\n\"When it comes to much of our national security policy, I must candidly express concern about the task that awaits Dr. Carter and the limited influence he may have,\" he said.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the armed services committee, said aside from not having served in the military, Carter was \"made for this job.\"\n\n\"I think he's a person of impressive convictions and capability who's going to provide strong leadership,\" he said.\n\nBut as one confirmation moved forward, another stalled. Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday decided to delay a committee vote to confirm Lynch, the president's nominee to replace Attorney General Eric Holder. Though several Republicans praised Lynch as her confirmation hearings ended last month, they featured a heavy dose of harsh criticism for Holder's Justice Department.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, applauded the speed of Carter's confirmation but struck back against the \"needless delay\" of Lynch's.\n\n\"She has already waited far longer for her confirmation vote than any attorney general in modern history,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe nomination of Carter was seen as perhaps the best chance for a smooth confirmation process through the newly Republican-controlled Senate. Top Republicans, including McCain, had expressed admiration for him in recent years.\n\nHe was also seen as a good choice to manage the Pentagon as it continues to deal with the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration.\n\nCarter, who managed a $600 billion annual budget in his previous post, pushed lawmakers to lift the mandatory cuts during his confirmation hearing.",

But it is an element of any true option,\" Carter wrote in a June 2008 paper for Harvard University's Belfer Center. \"Military action by itself will not finish the problem.\"\n\nIn his confirmation hearing, Carter said he would likely support the transfer of lethal defensive arms to Ukraine, before Thursday's announcement of a new ceasefire agreement between Kiev and Moscow.\n\nCarter also expressed support for Obama's strategy against Islamic State, heavily reliant on air power in the initial face of degrading the terrorist network.\n\n\"You don't want the population to settle into having ISIS rule them,\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe chairman of that committee, Senator John McCain (R-Arizona), voted in Carter's favor despite staunch and vocal opposition to the president's foreign policy on virtually all fronts.\n\n\"Dr. Carter is a worthy choice for secretary of defense. He has the experience, knowledge, and skill to succeed,\" McCain said on the Senate floor, announcing his vote. \"I do so with sincere hope and sadly little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.

The Senate Armed Services Committee approved him unanimously on Tuesday, and he was supported by nearly every Senate Republican.\n\nAshton Carter was approved by the Senate as the next Defense Secretary.

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and James Risch (R-Idaho).\n\nHis confirmation came just a day after the Obama administration asked Congress to authorize expanded military action against the Islamic State. The administration has stressed it does not want to authorize a long-term ground war, and the request includes language saying that no \"enduring\" use of ground forces would be allowed.\n\nKey GOP Republicans said Carter earned their support by saying he would reconsider the U.S. drawdown of forces in Afghanistan if needed, and that he would work to eliminate \"sequester\" cuts to the Defense Department.\n\n\"We need to stop holding our military hostage to domestic political disputes, and send an unmistakable message to friend and foe alike that America intends to lead in the 21st Century by repealing sequestration immediately,\" Sen.

The White House has said it wanted a new Pentagon chief to oversee the fight against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, as well as the continued drawdown of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" said Obama in a statement.\n\nA Rhodes scholar with eclectic interests -- he wrote an undergraduate thesis at Yale on the Latin writings of 12th-century Flemish monks -- Carter will return to the Pentagon just 14 months after he resigned as deputy secretary of defense. He previously served as the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer and also as a senior defense official during the Clinton administration.\n\nDuring testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, Carter pledged to keep an independent voice and demonstrated a willingness to differ with the White House. For example, he said he was \"inclined\" to support arms deliveries to Ukraine and that he would be open to reviewing the timetable for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said Carter would have to focus on existing problems such as the fighting in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan but also longer-term challenges such as China's military buildup.\n\nEven more daunting crises, he added, could emerge in the near future. For example, if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program fail this year, he noted, \"the consequences could alter the face of the region for generations and generations to come.\"\n\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the committee chairman, praised Carter on Thursday as a \"committed public servant\" who has drawn bipartisan support. But he questioned how much sway he would have with the White House.\n\n\"When it comes to much of our national security policy, I must candidly express concern about the task that awaits Dr. Carter and the limited influence he may have,\" McCain said. He said he had \"sincere hope, but sadly little confidence, that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.\"",

Spokesman Josh Earnest said any decision on arming Ukraine's army or other issues would be up to the \"commander-in-chief\" and not Carter.\n\nObama welcomed the Senate's swift confirmation of Carter's nomination.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\nCarter has gained a reputation as a bona-fide expert on hi-tech weapons and defence budgets, portraying himself as a reformer determined to shake up the Pentagon's vast bureaucracy.\n\nBut much of his time will be taken up with a new war against extremists in the Middle East, with the United States leading an open-ended bombing campaign against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHe also will have to contend with upheaval in Yemen, Iran's nuclear ambitions, a resurgent Russia that has rattled Eastern European allies, and an expanding Chinese military that could jeopardize the US Navy's dominance in the Pacific.\n\nMicro-management\n\nDespite deep divisions between the White House and many Republicans over US foreign policy, Carter's nomination encountered negligible opposition and he sailed through to confirmation with bipartisan support.\n\n\"I think Dr Carter will be a good secretary of defence,\" but \"I must candidly express concern about the task that faces Dr Carter, and the limited influence he may have,\" said Republican Senator John McCain, a hawk who has slammed Obama over his handling of the military.\n\nTwo previous Pentagon chiefs to serve in the Obama administration, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, bitterly complained of White House \"micro-management\" and meddling.\n\nGates has referred to \"the increasing desire of the White House to control and manage every aspect of military affairs.\"\n\nCarter will not be prepared to simply rubber stamp White House decisions, said Stephen Biddle, a professor at George Washington University who befriended Carter while at Harvard.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll want to be an architect and not just a carpenter,\" Biddle said.\n\nThe new Pentagon chief will take the helm as Congress takes up a proposal from Obama to back the use of military force against the IS jihadists, and as the White House weighs proposals from commanders to slow the pace of a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nWith Iraqi forces preparing for a counter-offensive against IS militants later this year, Carter could soon face a request from senior officers to deploy US forward air controllers in combat to help guide air strikes in support of the jihadists. That move would undercut Obama's promise not to put American \"boots on the ground.\"\n\nCarter replaces Chuck Hagel, who resigned under pressure in November. Hagel has acknowledged the White House was frustrated that he would not move faster on decisions to transfer some inmates out of the US-run prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAsked if he would resist White House pressure to release Guantanamo inmates if he thought they would rejoin extremists, Carter told senators: \"As in everything else I do, I'll play it absolutely straight.\"\n\nServing as deputy secretary of defence from 2011 to 2013 under Panetta and as chief weapons buyer under Gates, Carter has spent years learning how the Defence Department operates.\n\nThe top two civilian officials under him, Robert Work and Frank Kendall, are also experienced technocrats, and some analysts said Carter may be uniquely qualified to reform the Pentagon machine.\n\nBut Carter's hands may be tied by legislation that imposes automatic budget cuts, including across-the-board reductions for the Pentagon.\n\nThe top brass has urged Congress to scrap the \"sequester\" rules but in the meantime, Carter will have to plan for strict limits on defence spending in 2016. -- AFP",

Carter will replace former defense secretary Chuck Hagel, who announced his intention to step down from the position in December.\n\nCarter's confirmation came two days after the Senate Armed Services Committee unanimously voted to approve his nomination. He is expected to take up his responsibilities at the Pentagon on Friday, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHe provided the Senate Armed Services Committee with a 42-page document Monday which outlined his priorities if confirmed as secretary of defense. Specifically, Carter discussed a desire to continue to build the United States' military capabilities and to limit Russia's \"sphere of influence\" in Eastern Europe.\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his intention to support Carter's confirmation Thursday morning. However, he said his continued support for Carter was contingent on whether the 60-year-old was willing to stand up to President Barack Obama on his policies and attitudes toward Al Qaeda, Afghanistan and China's military buildup, among other hot-button issues.\n\n\"I intend to support Ash Carter's confirmation. But my support is conditioned on this request: the incoming Secretary needs to have the courage to speak truth to power. To Congress, yes. But also to his Commander in Chief,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\nCarter served as the deputy secretary of defense from October 2011 to December 2013, according to his official U.S. Department of Defense bio. Prior to that, he worked as undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from April 2009 to October 2011 and as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under President Bill Clinton. A theoretical physicist, Carter was a staunch critic of former President Ronald Reagan's \"Star Wars\" missile defense system in the 1980s.\n\nObama formally announced his nomination of Carter on Dec. 5. \"As a top member of our Pentagon team for the first five years of my presidency, including his two years as deputy secretary, he was at the table in the Situation Room; he was by my side navigating complex security challenges that we were confronting. I relied on his expertise, and I relied on his judgment,\" Obama said in a statement.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted overwhelmingly Thursday to approve the nomination of Ashton B. Carter, a former senior Pentagon official, as President Barack Obama's fourth secretary of defense.\n\nCarter, 60, will take over the Pentagon as the administration steps up the air war against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, officials consider slowing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and a new round of across-the-board spending cuts loom.\n\nCarter, who will be sworn in next week, has worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents. He won unanimous support earlier this week from the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nHis easy sail through the confirmation process in the Republican-led Congress stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, Chuck Hagel, a former Republican senator who saw his nomination blocked for nearly two weeks two years ago after he stumbled in his confirmation hearings.\n\nHagel announced plans to resign on Nov. 24 under pressure from the White House. Hagel, who will stay in the job until Carter is sworn in, has not disclosed his plans after he leaves the Pentagon.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Carter decried the \"malignant and savage terrorism\" of Islamic State militants, warned of Iran's expanding influence across the Middle East and called for an end to the congressionally mandated spending cuts known as sequestration.\n\nCarter also said he was \"very much inclined\" to provide weapons and ammunition to Ukrainian government forces fighting Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, signaling a possible shift in administration policy.\n\nIn a White House news conference on Monday, Obama said for the first time that he was considering supplying arms to Ukraine. But he said he had not made a decision and listed reasons why he might oppose deepening the U.S. involvement.\n\nThe issue may be moot, however, if a cease-fire deal announced Thursday in Minsk, Belarus, leads to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\nCarter's immediate focus will be military operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as well as renewed violence in Afghanistan. The military is also trying to deploy additional forces to Asia and the Western Pacific, partly to counterbalance China.\n\nCarter first joined the Pentagon in 1981 under President Ronald Reagan as a technical analyst. A decade later, President Bill Clinton named him assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, where he worked to ensure that the former Soviet nuclear weapons stockpile did not fall into the hands of potential terrorists or rogue states.\n\nCarter left the Pentagon in 1996. He returned in 2009 to serve in the department's No. 3 slot as the chief weapons buyer, working on the $400-billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. He was named deputy secretary in 2011 but left again after Obama picked Hagel to succeed Leon E. Panetta.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON (AFP) - Ashton Carter, a hard-charging intellectual known for blunt talk, was confirmed as US defence secretary Thursday, and he could soon find himself at odds with a White House that clashed with previous Pentagon chiefs.\n\nThe Senate - by a vote of 93 to five - overwhelmingly approved Carter, an accomplished defence technocrat with degrees in medieval history and theoretical physics.\n\nBut at his confirmation hearing last week, Carter signalled an independent streak, venturing beyond the White House's stated policy on Ukraine and promising a fresh look at troop withdrawal plans in Afghanistan.\n\nHis comments provoked a quick response from a White House known for its penchant for exerting tight control.\n\nSpokesman Josh Earnest said any decision on arming Ukraine's army or other issues would be up to the \"commander-in-chief\" and not Carter.\n\nObama welcomed the Senate's swift confirmation of Carter's nomination.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernise our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\nCarter has gained a reputation as a bona-fide expert on high-tech weapons and defence budgets, portraying himself as a reformer determined to shake up the Pentagon's vast bureaucracy.\n\nBut much of his time will be taken up with a new war against extremists in the Middle East, with the United States leading an open-ended bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.\n\nHe also will have to contend with upheaval in Yemen, Iran's nuclear ambitions, a resurgent Russia that has rattled Eastern European allies, and an expanding Chinese military that could jeopardise the US Navy's dominance in the Pacific.\n\nMICRO-MANAGEMENT\n\nDespite deep divisions between the White House and many Republicans over US foreign policy, Carter's nomination encountered negligible opposition and he sailed through to confirmation with bipartisan support.\n\n\"I think Dr Carter will be a good secretary of defence,\" but \"I must candidly express concern about the task that faces Dr Carter, and the limited influence he may have,\" said Republican Senator John McCain, a hawk who has slammed Obama over his handling of the military.\n\nTwo previous Pentagon chiefs to serve in the Obama administration, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, bitterly complained of White House \"micro-management\" and meddling.\n\nGates has referred to \"the increasing desire of the White House to control and manage every aspect of military affairs\".\n\nCarter will not be prepared to simply rubber stamp White House decisions, said Stephen Biddle, a professor at George Washington University who befriended Carter while at Harvard.\n\n\"I'm sure he'll want to be an architect and not just a carpenter,\" Biddle said.\n\nThe new Pentagon chief will take the helm as Congress takes up a proposal from Obama to back the use of military force against the ISIS militants, and as the White House weighs proposals from commanders to slow the pace of a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nWith Iraqi forces preparing for a counter-offensive against ISIS militants later this year, Carter could soon face a request from senior officers to deploy US forward air controllers in combat to help guide air strikes in support of the extremists.\n\nThat move would undercut Obama's promise not to put American \"boots on the ground\".\n\nCarter replaces Chuck Hagel, who resigned under pressure in November. Hagel has acknowledged the White House was frustrated that he would not move faster on decisions to transfer some inmates out of the US-run prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAsked if he would resist White House pressure to release Guantanamo inmates if he thought they would rejoin extremists, Carter told senators: \"As in everything else I do, I'll play it absolutely straight.\"\n\nServing as deputy secretary of defence from 2011 to 2013 under Panetta and as chief weapons buyer under Gates, Carter has spent years learning how the defence department operates.\n\nThe top two civilian officials under him, Robert Work and Frank Kendall, are also experienced technocrats, and some analysts said Carter may be uniquely qualified to reform the Pentagon machine.\n\nBut Carter's hands may be tied by legislation that imposes automatic budget cuts, including across-the-board reductions for the Pentagon.\n\nThe top brass has urged Congress to scrap the \"sequester\" rules but in the meantime, Carter will have to plan for strict limits on defence spending in 2016.",

The committee held a lengthy confirmation hearing for him last week that became a proxy for Republican senators to attack the President's handling of various international hotspots -- like Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine -- that Carter will now help manage.\n\n\"He is one of America's most respected defense professionals, respected by Republicans and Democrats alike,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who chairs the committee.\n\n\"I have no doubt the vote on Dr. Carter will be overwhelmingly favorable,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, in a floor speech. \"He served as the day-to-day financial officer at the Pentagon. So he is one of the few people that understands, really understands, the complexities of the Pentagon's budget.\"\n\nAt the hearing, Carter promised to be a straight shooter with Congress and the President. He even presented views on Afghanistan and Ukraine that differed slightly with current administration policy.\n\nIn a floor speech Thursday, McCain warned the biggest challenge Carter might face is \"White House micromanagement of the Defense Department and over-centralization of foreign and defense policy,\" which McCain said Hagel and his predecessor Lean Panetta \"severely criticized.\"\n\nMcCain said Hagel was frustrated by \"the insular and indecisive White House national security team\" on a variety of key issues.\n\nRecommended",

The Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week voted unanimously to send Carter to the full Senate for approval.\n\nArizona Republican Sen. John McCain, chairman of the committee, praised Carter for his experience and for his stance on a number of key defense questions that came up during his nomination hearing. Carter spoke at that hearing about the need to get rid of the sequestration budget cuts and his support for providing weapons to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression - a position that put him at odds with President Obama.\n\n\"I think Dr. Carter will be a good secretary of defense, who will always keep faith with our men and women in uniform and work tirelessly on their behalf and that of our national security,\" McCain said on the Senate floor before the vote. \"I am hopeful about the prospects of working together with Dr. Carter, along with my colleagues in the Committee on Armed Services, to achieve our shared priorities, especially the reform of our defense acquisition system, the modernization of our military compensation system, and the repeal of sequestration.\"\n\nFive lawmakers, all Republican, voted against the nomination, including Sens. Roy Blunt, John Boozman, Mike Crapo, Mark Kirk and James Risch.\n\n\"Mine is a vote of no confidence in the national security decisions of this Administration,\" Kirk said in a statement.\n\nCarter has served in multiple roles in the Defense Department during the Obama administration, including deputy secretary of defense from 2011 until 2013. He also served in the department under President Bill Clinton. Carter earned a doctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar, and served as chair of the International and Global Affairs faculty at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.\n\nBoth Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Harry Reid supported his nomination, although Reid did not vote because he is recovering from surgery.\n\n\"Dr. Carter's background will make him an effective leader to confront the challenges and threats facing our nation, and I am pleased with the strong bipartisan vote in support of the president's nomination,\" Reid said in a statement.\n\nMcConnell's support came with a single condition, which he named on the Senate floor Thursday morning: \"The incoming secretary needs to have the courage to speak truth to power. To Congress, yes. But also to his commander in chief.\"",

He is expected to take office next week.\n\nCarter takes office as the United States grapples with a series of daunting challenges, especially the fight against the IS. Earlier this week, Obama asked Congress to authorize the use of force against the militant group, a move critics say could lead to deployment of ground forces.\n\n\"With his overwhelming bipartisan confirmation by the Senate today, I'm proud to welcome him back as our next Secretary of Defense,\" Obama said in a statement. \"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats.\"\n\nCarter, a nuclear physicist who earned his doctorate from the University of Oxford, has had three stints at the Pentagon, most recently as deputy secretary from 2011 to 2013.\n\nHis two other previous stints at the Pentagon are as under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from 2009 to 2011, and assistant secretary for international security policy from 1993 to 1996. As assistant secretary, he also participated in negotiations to defuse the first North Korean nuclear crisis.\n\nCarter's nominations for the Pentagon's No. 2 and No. 3 jobs were all approved unanimously at the time.\n\nHe is considered a hawk on North Korea's provocations and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing last week, Carter pledged to significantly beef up missile defense, including deploying more ground-based missile interceptors in California and Alaska, saying North Korean missiles could pose a \"direct threat\" to the country.\n\nIn 2006, Carter openly called for a preemptive strike on a North Korean long-range missile that was being readied for a test-launch, claiming that the risk of inaction in the face of North Korea's race to threaten the U.S. would be greater than the risk associated with a preemptive strike.",

The Senate voted 93-5 to confirm him.\n\nHe's a Rhodes scholar with degrees in theoretical physics and medieval history, well respected by lawmakers for his thoughtful work as a senior official in the Pentagon.\n\nBut while he has enjoyed a warmer welcome to the job than his predecessor -- Hagel's nomination process was fraught with confrontations with senators and a largely partisan confirmation vote -- that honeymoon won't last long.\n\nCarter will immediately be thrust into the budding debate over Obama's request for a new authorization for military force in the fight against Islamic State forces in the Middle East, and the decision whether to provide more arms to Ukrainian forces in their fight against Russia.\n\nOn the latter topic, he has already told senators he would be inclined to increase U.S. help to Ukraine, in opposition to administration moves so far.\n\nCarter also will start his work as lawmakers begin digging into the annual defense budget. During his confirmation hearing, he lamented looming sequestration cuts that military leaders say will cripple force readiness, and pledged to push Congress to fix the issue before this fall.\n\nBut no clear legislative solution has emerged so far, leaving the Defense Department with months of uncertainty as the new fiscal year looms.\n\nThe only criticism Carter faced in his confirmation process had more to do with his new boss than his own r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said he did not vote for Carter because of Obama's micromanagement of national security issues. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, offered similar complaints, but praised Carter's credentials and character and endorsed his selection.\n\nCarter had spent much of the past month meeting with senators in advance of the confirmation vote, and is expected to return to Capitol Hill within weeks for budget and national security hearings.\n\nCONNECT 7 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://militari.ly/1E5bchk",

Carter is taking the helm of the US military at a time of transition. The United States has seriously wound down its presence in Afghanistan, although there are still troops operating in the country, while increasing its involvement in Iraq and Syria.\n\nCarter will be the new head of the military as it continues airstrikes against the Islamic States, a campaign that could very well continue after Carter is no longer the Secretary of Defense.\n\nA major factor in Carter's confirmation was his previous experience in the Department of Defense as a bureaucrat who oversaw a budget valued at $600 billion annually. The Defense Department is still adjusting to the sequestration that limited some of its funding, and it is believed that Carter has the experience to make the best of the situation.\n\nReuters notes that Carter was in charge of revamping the bloated and delayed F-35 program. Carter told the Senate that his primary goals as Secretary of Defense would be improving the speed with which new technology is introduced to the armed forces, while also driving down the cost of the development of that new technology.\n\nCarter also said that he was undecided about providing weaponry to the Ukrainian military, which is currently under debate in the Obama Administration. He said he was open to the idea, but that the best way to resolve the situation in eastern Ukraine was through diplomacy and economic pressure.",

                    "body": "The Senate approved Ashton Carter Thursday as the next secretary of defense in a vote that saw only five nays -- all from Republicans -- and 93 yays.\n\nCarter's nomination process was relatively stress free for the Obama administration as he received round support from both sides of the aisle to include Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who set up road blocks for past Obama nominees to include his friend, Chuck Hagel.\n\nA Rhodes Scholar with a doctorate in theoretical physics, Carter never served in the military, but he has plenty of experience navigating the halls of the Pentagon. He served as the deputy defense secretary before stepping down last year and earned wide praise for his expertise on the military's acquisition process.\n\nCarter made waves when he oversaw the development of the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle program, an effort that sent thousands of these heavily armored trucks to Iraq and Afghanistan at a time when troops were getting killed at a high rate by road side bombs.\n\nObama turned to Carter to take the reins of the Pentagon after he was reportedly turned down by other first choices to include Michele Flournoy, the CEO of the Center for a New American Security. But both sides of the aisle seemed to agree, Obama picked the right man for the job.\n\nCarter takes over the Pentagon at a time when its service chiefs are saying they don't have enough money in their budgets to continue responding to threats like ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and Russia on the Ukraine border while also modernizing and resetting their forces. The common refrain from critics is the Pentagon would have the money it needed if it would stop wasting millions of dollars on over budget or failed weapons programs.\n\nOfficials inside and outside the military point fingers at the Pentagon's acquisition system saying it's ill equipped to supply troops with the technologically advanced weapons and equipment needed on the battlefield.\n\nCarter enters the Pentagon as a champion for reforming that system and some defense analysts and lawmakers on Capitol Hill believe he's one of the few bureaucrats capable of delivering necessary changes. Carter joins Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Kendall -- two men who have also worked to try and fix the most common problems with the acquisition system -- namely its lack of agility and seeming inability to keep projects on time and on budget.\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., called Carter, Work and Kendall a \"dream team of wonkiness\" when speaking to Philip Ewing of Politico on the subject. Lawmakers signaled that Carter's acquisition chops played into their decision to support his nomination.\n\nCarter will have about 18 months to prove he is the right man to lead the Pentagon as campaigns to take Obama's job as commander-in-chief have begun for the 2016 presidential election. It's not unheard of for a new president to keep a defense secretary on board. In fact, Obama did so with Robert Gates. But it is rare.\n\nCarter seemingly has the support of Congress and the White House -- a rare accomplishment. But now the hard work starts and it will be telling to see how long that support remains as Capitol Hill sharpens its knives for the budget battle and the debates on the draft resolution to fight ISIS.",

The new Pentagon chief's inclination to provide U.S. lethal weaponry aid to Ukraine to fight pro-Russian rebels was criticized by the White House's spokesman, Josh Earnest, saying that any decision on U.S foreign policy would be given by the \"commander-in-chief,\" and not Carter.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, [Carter] will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement, welcoming the U.S. Senate's swift confirmation of Carter's nomination.\n\nCarter said that Russia's military moves in Ukraine are \"a clear violation\" of a 1994 commitment that Russia made to respect the sovereignty of the newly independent Ukraine as part of Ukraine's agreement to give up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the former Soviet Union. The so-called Budapest Agreement \"provided for Russia to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which it's obviously not done,\" Carter told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee at his confirmation hearing. \"And that is part of the climate and context in which the Ukrainians agreed to give up nuclear weapons in the first place.\"\n\nObama nominated the former Pentagon deputy chief expert as his new secretary of defense after Chuck Hagel resigned in November 2014. After his resignation from the Pentagon's top job over his disagreement and questioning of the administration's policy on the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and the Syrian regime, Hagel released a statement that supported Carter's new role as his successor. According to the Pentagon, as undersecretary, Carter led the department's efforts to accelerate the fulfillment of urgent operational needs, increase the department's buying power and strengthen the nation's defenses against emerging threats.",

With six years into this Administration, we still have no coherent strategy to deter Russia, China, Iran, Islamic extremists and other terrorist groups, and we still have no overarching strategy to address an increasingly complex global threat landscape. I will be counting on Dr. Carter to help reverse this course and I expect him to provide candid and independent counsel to our nation's Commander-in-Chief.\" The 60-year-old Carter is a physicist by training.

Spokesman Josh Earnest said any decision on arming Ukraine's army or other issues would be up to the \"commander-in-chief\" and not Carter.\n\nObama welcomed the Senate's swift confirmation of Carter's nomination.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\nCarter has gained a reputation as a bona fide expert on high-tech weapons and defense budgets, portraying himself as a reformer determined to shake up the Pentagon's vast bureaucracy.\n\nHowever, much of his time is expected to be taken up with a new war against extremists in the Middle East, with the US leading an open-ended bombing campaign against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHe would also have to contend with upheaval in Yemen, Iran's nuclear ambitions, a resurgent Russia that has rattled Eastern European allies and an expanding Chinese military that could jeopardize the US Navy's dominance in the Pacific.\n\nTwo previous Pentagon chiefs to serve in the Obama administration, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, bitterly complained of White House \"micro-management\" and meddling. Gates has referred to \"the increasing desire of the White House to control and manage every aspect of military affairs.\"\n\nThe new Pentagon chief will take the helm as US Congress takes up a proposal from Obama to back the use of military force against Islamic State militants, and as the White House weighs proposals from commanders to slow the pace of a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nWith Iraqi forces preparing for a counter-offensive against militants later this year, Carter could soon face a request from senior officers to deploy US forward air controllers in combat to help guide air strikes. That move would undercut Obama's promise not to put US \"boots on the ground.\"\n\nCarter replaces Chuck Hagel, who resigned under pressure in November last year. Hagel has acknowledged the White House was frustrated that he would not move faster on decisions to transfer some inmates out of the US-run prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAsked if he would resist White House pressure to release Guantanamo inmates if he thought they would rejoin extremists, Carter told senators: \"As in everything else I do, I'll play it absolutely straight.\"\n\nHowever, Carter's hands might be tied by legislation that imposes automatic budget cuts, including across-the-board reductions for the Pentagon. The top brass has urged Congress to scrap the \"sequester\" rules, but in the meantime, Carter would have to plan for strict limits on defense spending next year.",

Two senators, Republican Jerry Moran of Kansas and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, abstained from voting, reported CBS News.\n\nCarter was also unanimously approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week.

Before that, he had also held a number of positions in the Pentagon under Obama and former President Bill Clinton, along with long stints in academia and the private sector.\n\nHe signaled his support for delivering lethal arms to the Ukrainian military to defend the country against Russia-backed rebels during his confirmation hearing before the Armed Services committee last week.",

The committee held a lengthy confirmation hearing for him last week that became a proxy for Republican senators to attack the President's handling of various international hotspots -- like Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine -- that Carter will now help manage.\n\n\"He is one of America's most respected defense professionals, respected by Republicans and Democrats alike,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who chairs the committee.\n\n\"I have no doubt the vote on Dr. Carter will be overwhelmingly favorable,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, in a floor speech. \"He served as the day-to-day financial officer at the Pentagon. So he is one of the few people that understands, really understands, the complexities of the Pentagon's budget.\"\n\nAt the hearing, Carter promised to be a straight shooter with Congress and the President. He even presented views on Afghanistan and Ukraine that differed slightly with current administration policy.\n\nIn a floor speech Thursday, McCain warned the biggest challenge Carter might face is \"White House micromanagement of the Defense Department and over-centralization of foreign and defense policy,\" which McCain said Hagel and his predecessor Lean Panetta \"severely criticized.\"\n\nMcCain said Hagel was frustrated by \"the insular and indecisive White House national security team\" on a variety of key issues.",

He'll be the 4 secretary of defense in the last six years.\n\nVoting to confirm Carter were Louisiana's two senators, Republicans David Vitter and Bill Cassidy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who voted to confirm Carter, said he'll need \"to have the courage to speak truth to power -- to Congress, yes, but also to his commander in chief.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Vitter met with Carter, asking for his support in maintaining and strengthening Fort Polk and grating Four-Star Recognition for Barksdale's Global Strike Command.\n\n\"Our Brigade Combat Team at Fort Polk and Global Strike Command at Barksdale are absolutely necessary to continue protecting our country,\" Vitter said. \"As we continue to face increasing threats from terrorists abroad, I want to make sure Dr. Carter understands the role Louisiana plays in maintaining a strong national defense. He committed to working with me in support of the nuclear mission and advancing the plan to make Global Strike Command a 4-star position, so I will be supporting his nomination.\"\n\nPresident Obama praised Carter's confirmation.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" Obama said.\n\n\"As secretary of defense, Ash will play a central role in our work with Congress to find a more responsible approach to defense spending that makes the department more efficient, preserves military readiness, and keeps faith with our men and women in uniform and their families. We have the strongest military in history of the world, and with Secretary Carter at the Pentagon and our troops serving bravely around the world, we're going to keep it that way.\"\n\nSenate Republicans resisted Democratic requests to hold a confirmation vote for Loretta Lynch, President Obama's nominee for attorney general, before it breaks for a one-week recess. She is expected to win confirmation when the Senate returns.\n\nVitter, a new member this year on the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced early on -- even before confirmation hearings before the panel -- that he would be a no vote in protest of President Obama's executive order on immigration.\n\nDuring questioning by Vitter, Lynch rejected the Louisiana's senator's contention that the order -- deferring deportations for more than 4 million adults in the United States without legal documentation -- is beyond his authority. Lynch said it is \"reasonable\" to prioritize removal of the most dangerous undocumented immigrants with the limited resources available, \"particularly those who were involved in violent crime, terrorism, recent crossers, those with criminal records.\"",

SASC chairman Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) called him \"one of America's most respected and experienced defense professionals.\" Ranking SASC member Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) said Carter was \"uniquely qualified to lead the Department of Defense.\"\n\nPresident Obama praised Carter's confirmation in a statement from the White House. \"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernize our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats, Obama said.",

Here's a look at how Carter compares to his predecessor.\n\nCarter has a background in physics and first entered the Pentagon under the Clinton administration. He was most recently Deputy Defense Secretary. He doesn't have a military background -- a stark contrast to Hagel.\n\nHagel was the first Defense Secretary who was an enlisted veteran. Before his appointment, he had a business background and had served as a U.S. senator representing Nebraska.\n\nIn Hagel's time at the Pentagon, overseeing a decrease of the defense budget was supposed to be his main focus, but legislative gridlock stopped him from getting much done on that front, and global crises in Syria and Eastern Ukraine diverted his attention.\n\nCarter, on the other hand, is seen as a competent bureaucrat who might be able to successfully handle budget cuts. But he lacks the experience on the political side that Hagel had.\n\nHagel's relationship with the Obama administration was tense by the end of his tenure. He openly questioned the White House's approach to Syria and also admitted he moved slower on transferring Guantanamo detainees than the White House wanted.\n\n\"Not everyone at the White House has agreed with how I've handled some of this. I have made it very clear that I will not certify, sign anything to release a detainee as long as I'm Secretary of Defense, unless I am convinced that it is in the best interest of this country,\" Hagel said.\n\nThat tension reportedly led to pressure for his resignation. In a sign of butting heads, Hagel was noticeably absent from Obama's announcement to nominate Carter as the successor.\n\nIn matters of foreign policy, Carter is expected to be on the right of President Obama. During his Senate hearings, he said he would not be pressured to rush closing Guantanamo Bay and said he is leaning toward arming Ukrainian soldiers.",

Both stands could put him at odds with the White House.\n\nMcCain, however, questioned whether Carter could withstand \"micromanagement\" from the White House. Former Defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates complained late last year of undue meddling by White House aides.\n\nHowever, Gates, in a recent interview with USA TODAY, said Carter is well qualified to lead the Pentagon. Carter's relationship with Obama and White House officials will serve him well, Gates said.\n\n\"The difference is that Ash has served more than five years with this administration,\" Gates said. \"So he knows this president; this president knows him. He knows all the players at multiple levels. They will be familiar to him, and he to them. That'll make a big difference in terms of working relationships.\"\n\n246 CONNECT 181 TWEET 14 LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1DluiBh",

Sequester is risky to our defense, it introduces turbulence and uncertainty that are wasteful, and it conveys a misleadingly diminished picture of our power in the eyes of friends and foes alike.\"\n\nOn the issue of the defense budget:\n\n\"I cannot suggest support and stability for the defense budget without at the same time frankly noting that not every defense dollar is spent as well as it should be. The taxpayer cannot comprehend, let alone support the defense budget, when they read of cost overruns, lack of accounting and accountability, needless overhead, and the like. This must stop.

I understand we have a plan, the president has a plan I support that plan - at the same time, its a plan - and if I'm confirmed and I ascertain as years go by that we need to change that plan i will recommend those changes to the President.\"",

Both stands could put him at odds with the White House.\n\nMcCain, however, questioned whether Carter could withstand \"micromanagement\" from the White House. Former Defense secretaries Leon Panetta and Robert Gates complained late last year of undue meddling by White House aides.\n\nHowever, Gates, in a recent interview with USA TODAY, said Carter is well qualified to lead the Pentagon. His relationship with Obama and White House officials will serve Carter well, Gates said.\n\n\"The difference is that Ash has served more than five years with this administration,\" Gates said. \"So he knows this president; this president knows him. He knows all the players at multiple levels. They will be familiar to him, and he to them. That'll make a big difference in terms of working relationships.\"\n\n10 CONNECT 50 TWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1DluiBh",

Hagel resigned last November reportedly under pressure.\n\n\"With his decades of experience, Ash will help keep our military strong as we continue the fight against terrorist networks, modernise our alliances, and invest in new capabilities to keep our armed forces prepared for long-term threats,\" said Obama after the Senate vote.\n\n\"We have the strongest military in history of the world, and with Secretary Carter at the Pentagon and our troops serving bravely around the world, we're going to keep it that way,\" he added.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing last week, Carter, who as Pentagon No. 2 launched the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) with India, vowed to lean-forward to expand DTTI with additional co-production and co-development activities.\n\n\"We are seeing greater convergence in our interests and concerns than ever before, particularly between our rebalance to Asia and India's 'Act East,'\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"Strengthening the US-India defence relationship was a priority for me as Deputy Secretary of Defence and, if confirmed, I will continue to prioritise the steady growth of this relationship,\" he said.\n\nDefence plays a vital role in US-India relations, which includes a robust series of military exchanges and exercises, a strong track record on defence trade, and increasingly close consultations on regional security issues, Carter said.\n\nDuring his recent India trip, he noted Obama announced four pathfinder projects under DTTI, a working group on aircraft carrier cooperation, and the possibility of cooperating on jet engine technology.\n\nCarter said he will also \"continue to find ways to strengthen our military-to-military relationship by expanding the scope and complexity of our exercises, and ensure the consistency of our engagement.\"\n\nCarter said he would \"prioritise exchanges at all levels of our military, and encourage frequent high-level visits.\"\n\nHe would also \"continue to look for ways to expand upon our maritime security relationship and identify specific areas for increased cooperation, including in the Asia-Pacific.\"",

                    "body": "This vote is a stark contrast to Chuck Hagel's confirmation vote two years ago\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate confirmed Ashton Carter to succeed Chuck Hagel as U.S. Secretary of Defense. The former deputy defense secretary received a near unanimous vote from the Senate Armed Service Committee ahead of the full Senate vote.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Carter 93 to 5. Nearly every Republican crossed the aisle and voted for President Obama's nominee to succeed outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, following a 25-0 vote out of the Senate Armed Service Committee Wednesday, with one Republican not voting.\n\nOnly Sens. John Boozman, R-Ark.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Mark Kirk. R-Ill.; and James Risch, R-Idaho, voted against Carter. This vote is a stark contrast to Hagel's confirmation vote two years ago. In 2013, Hagel was confirmed by the full Senate 58-41, Politico noted at the time.\n\nReuters pointed out that Carter served as deputy defense secretary between 2011 and 2013 and was the chief weapons buyer for the Defense Department from 2009 to 2011. The Massachusetts native, who has a bachelors and a doctorate in physics as well as another bachelors in medieval history, is now tasked with executing the Obama administration's defense strategy across the world, which has been under scrutiny.\n\nPresident Obama submitted a plan to Congress Wednesday that would send the United States to war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But the plan limits \"enduring offensive ground combat operations\" and limits the war against the Islamic extremist group to three years, unless Congress reauthorizes military force.\n\n\"And here we have the president coming up with this - I think it's utterly stupid - proposal,\" Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told radio station KSL Wednesday. \"And he's binding the next president also with really stupid language.\"\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., agreed, telling The New York Times: \"If the president wants to engage in a halfhearted P.R. effort, to go through the motions to give the appearance that we're fighting when we're not doing what is necessary to win, then we should not engage.\"",

He is expected to start work on Tuesday.\n\nCarter, 60, who has a doctorate degree in theoretical physics, never served in the military but held senior positions at the Pentagon, including chief weapons buyer and deputy secretary of defense. He emerged as the front-runner for the top position last year after Hagel made a surprise announcement that he planned to resign from the post in less than two years in the job.\n\nHagel reportedly fought with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other White House officials over micromanagement of the Pentagon and how best to fight militants affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). He stumbled out of the gate when he drew blistering criticism during his confirmation hearing from former GOP colleagues, many of whom bristled at his opposition to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.\n\nBy contrast, Carter's confirmation hearing last week was largely devoid of sharp questioning from lawmakers.\n\nHe drew bipartisan praise for indicating he was likely to favor sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to fight Russia. He also said he would seek to maintain an independent voice in shaping the drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, as well as a long-term strategy against the Islamic State.\n\nIn written responses to senators' questions, Carter said military pay, benefits and a health system better synched with the Veterans Administration were critical to recruit and retain troops.\n\n\"Providing an appropriate pay and benefits package is essential to this task, but compensation and benefits costs must be balanced with readiness and modernization requirements,\" he wrote.\n\nThe five senators who opposed his nomination were all Republicans: Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho, Mark Kirk of Illinois and John Boozman of Arkansas.",

                    "body": "The US Senate voted Thursday by a margin of 93-5 to approve President Obama's nomination of Ashton Carter as secretary of defense. The new Pentagon chief was backed by every Democrat voting, and the vast majority of the Republicans. Carter will be Obama's fourth secretary of defense, following Robert Gates, Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel, who was forced to submit his resignation last fall.\n\nThe action by the full Senate follows a unanimous vote by the Senate Armed Services Committee, where Carter was repeatedly praised by the panel chairman, Senator John McCain, and other advocates of the escalation of US military aggression in the Middle East and throughout the world.\n\nTheir only complaint was that Carter would not be able to set policy in keeping with his own preferences, but would be subordinate to decisions made at the White House and transmitted to the Pentagon by the National Security Council.\n\nCarter, the former deputy secretary of defense during Obama's first term, is one of the most militarist figures in the Democratic Party's foreign policy establishment. In the course of his testimony to the Senate Armed Service Committee, he voiced his personal support for arms shipments to the ultra-right government of Ukraine, a move currently being considered by the Obama administration He also said that he could support loosening or reversing restrictions on the deployment of US troops to Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, depending on the conditions in each country.\n\nA devastating profile of Carter appeared Monday on Politico.com, under the headline \"The Democrats' Dick Cheney,\" noting Carter's record of support for dictatorial measures in the event of a future mass-casualty attack on the United States. He co-authored a 2007 policy paper titled \"The Day After: Action Following a Nuclear Blast in an American City.\" According to Politico, \"It floated the idea of setting up an emergency, extra-constitutional governing body advised by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nCarter also co-wrote a 1998 article for Foreign Affairs on future terrorist attacks, suggesting that the US government would respond by \"scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects, and use of deadly force.\" He also publicly advocated a US preemptive strike against North Korean nuclear installations in 2006, in a op-ed co-authored by former Clinton administration Pentagon chief William Perry.\n\nThe unanimous vote for Carter by Senate Democrats was a much better measure of their attitude to American militarism than the phony complaints raised over the last 24 hours that the Obama administration was seeking too sweeping an Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nNot a single Democratic senator or congressman has publicly backed the AUMF draft released by the White House February 11. This is all cynical political pretense, given that Obama has declared that he already has legal authority for the military operations against ISIS and the war will continue regardless of any action by Congress, which in any case is controlled by Republicans.\n\nSenator Timothy Kaine of Virginia criticized the AUMF draft because its prohibition of \"enduring offensive ground combat operations\" was too vague -- none of the terms are defined. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who calls himself an independent but plans to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, declared he \"cannot support the resolution in its current form without clearer limitations on the role of US combat troops.\"\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the darling of left-liberal publications like the Nation magazine, said she supported \"a strong coordinated response\" to ISIS, but added, \"I do not want America to be dragged into another ground war in the Middle East.\"\n\nWhen it came to actual decision-making, however, as opposed to political gestures towards popular antiwar sentiment, Kaine, Sanders and Warren all cast votes to approve Ashton Carter as the new secretary of defense.\n\nComments by administration officials after the release of the AUMF text suggest that the resolution would be used to justify further expansion of US military operations around the world, including within the United States itself.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged Wednesday that the language drafted was intentionally ambiguous, \"because we believe it's important that there aren't overly burdensome constraints that are placed on the commander in chief.\" He defended the resolution's failure to place any geographic limit on the war with ISIS, saying Obama and the US military \"need the flexibility to be able to respond to contingencies that emerge in a chaotic military conflict like this.\"\n\nSignificantly, US military spokesmen in both Washington and Kabul said Wednesday that ISIS militants were now operating in Afghanistan. This would give the administration a pretext to resume combat operations in Afghanistan, which officially ended six weeks ago, and to renege on its pledge to withdraw all US military forces by the end of 2016.\n\nThe United States too is a potential arena for military action against ISIS under the AUMF. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Michael Steinbach told the House Homeland Security Committee Thursday that US intelligence agencies did not know how many ISIS supporters had returned from the Middle East to prepare terrorist attacks within the US. \"It would not be true if I told you that we knew about all of the returnees,\" he said. \"We know what we know.\"\n\nNicholas Rasmussen, head of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, told the same committee that \"a few hundred individuals\" inside the US might launch terrorist attacks based on contact with social media produced by ISIS. He said that the public should expect as many as ten such attacks each year.\n\nThese two officials used the alleged threat of terrorist attacks to justify expanded electronic surveillance of the American population. Under terms of the AUMF, however, any action linked to ISIS could become the pretext for the use of military forces within the United States -- an escalation beyond the military-style police shutdown of Boston after the 2013 Marathon bombing, to the actual deployment of soldiers.\n\nWhile the American media for the most part presented the proposed AUMF as a \"compromise\" measure, too sweeping for most Democrats, too restrictive for most Republicans, the British publication Guardian highlighted the unlimited character of the war measure. Obama's resolution would authorize \"a second simultaneous global war that will outlast his presidency,\" on top of the global war against Al Qaeda approved by Congress after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nMicah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations told the newspaper, \"Obama has given everyone who will serve in his administration the ability to prosecute this war in as expansive a manner as they choose.\"",

                    "body": "THE TOPLINE: The Senate on Thursday confirmed Ashton Carter as President Obama's new secretary of Defense in a 93-5 vote.\n\nCarter, 60, will be the 25th secretary of Defense and Obama's fourth. He is expected to be sworn into office next week.\n\nFive Republican senators voted against Carter -- Sens. Roy Blunt (Mo.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Mark Kirk (Ill.), Jim Risch (Idaho) and John Boozman (Ark.).\n\n\"During his confirmation hearing, I asked Dr. Carter about the continued injustice our men and women in uniform face after reporting sexual assault and was encouraged that he recognized the problem and expressed his commitment to addressing it,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\"I have worked with Ash Carter in the past on vital programs, such as the Joint Strike Fighter, Blackhawk helicopters, submarines being built at Electric Boat in Groton, and the expedited fielding of enhanced body armor to protect our troops in Afghanistan,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \"I look forward to working with him as he does more to reform the contracting process to eliminate waste and fraud.\"\n\n\"It is well known that former secretaries of defense under this President have been micromanaged by the White House, making their jobs even more difficult. Only time will tell if the President decides to take a new approach in working with Secretary Carter,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in a statement.\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) said, \"I believe he will provide strong, straightforward leadership to our nation's Armed Forces, and I am pleased he has been confirmed as our new Secretary of Defense.\"\n\nThe Aerospace Industries Association President and CEO Marion Blakey said in a statement that the aerospace and defense industry also looks forward to working closely with the new Pentagon chief.\n\n\"Our industry stands ready to support Secretary Carter and the country's national defense interests,\" she said. \"It is an important time to ensure the nation has the funding needed to invest in new technology to address rising and unanticipated national security crises around the globe, as well as to keep our industry robust and internationally competitive.\"\n\nAFGHAN PLAN UNDER REVIEW: The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan on Thursday said the administration is reviewing the schedule of a troop withdrawal from that country.\n\nArmy Gen. John Campbell said the options he provided would allow for more troops throughout the summer fighting season.\n\n\"I have provided options to my chain of command,\" Campbell told lawmakers at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe administration now plans to drawdown the roughly 10,000 U.S. troops to 5,500 by the middle of this year's fighting season. Troop levels would drop further to 1,000 by the end of next year.\n\nRepublicans have charged that the administration is withdrawing troops too quickly from Afghanistan.\n\nCampbell also confirmed reports that the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has spread into Afghanistan, though he said the presence was \"nascent\" and \"fledgling.\"\n\nHe said it partly reflects some Taliban members \"rebranding\" themselves as ISIS.\n\nThe acknowledgment came after the Pentagon confirmed it had conducted a drone strike in Afghanistan's Helmand province earlier this week, killing former Taliban member and Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainee Abdul Rauf, who had become an ISIS leader and recruiter. Seven of his associates were also killed.\n\nPentagon officials played down ISIS's presence in Afghanistan, calling \"aspirational.\" They noted, however, that Rauf was a threat to U.S. forces that needed to be taken out.\n\n\"He and his associates were targeted, because we had information that they were planning operations against U.S. and Afghan personnel there in Afghanistan,\" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said on Wednesday.\n\nWH THREATENS TO VETO GITMO BILL. President Obama will veto a bill that would effectively block the transfer of detainees from Guant\u00e1namo Bay for the remainder of his presidency.\n\nThe legislation, passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on a 14-12 vote, would suspend the transfer of high- or medium-risk terror suspects, and prohibit the president from sending a detainee to a country where a former Guant\u00e1namo prisoner returned and reengaged in terrorist activities.\n\nIt would also repeal an existing law that gives the president authority to transfer detainees, and reinstate a ban on detainees being returned to Yemen, which is currently undergoing a tumultuous and violent political transition.\n\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz said the legislation would put \"more constraints on a process that should be actually working faster,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe restated the White House's position that the prison at Guant\u00e1namo put U.S. national security at risk.\n\nSUICIDE PREVENTION BILL SIGNED INTO LAW. President Obama signed a $24 million bill aimed at halting suicide among military veterans.\n\nThe Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, named after a 28-year-old Marine Corps veteran who took his life in 2011 after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, calls for third-party audits of suicide prevention programs in the Veterans Affairs Department to determine which efforts are successful or should be cut.\n\nIt also creates a centralized website detailing mental healthcare services available from the VA and starts a three-year pilot program to repay student loan debt for those who study psychiatric medicine and commit to working for the agency.\n\n\"Today we honor a young man who isn't here but should be here,\" Obama said during a signing ceremony in the East Room of the White House. \"Clay had already done a great deal of good in the world and the truth is he was just getting started.\"\n\nMore than 8,000 veterans commit suicide every year, according to VA estimates.\n\nObama said the legislation would help fill \"critical gaps\" but warned that it is not a \"complete solution.\"\n\nJake Wood, co-founder and CEO of Team Rubicon, who served alongside Hunt in Afghanistan, said the bill signing \"marks a historic event for the veteran community.\"\n\nObama also pleaded with veterans to seek help if they need it, arguing it is not a sign of weakness.\n\n\"If you are hurting, know this, you are not forgotten,\" he said.",

Roy Blunt, R-Mo., issued a brief statement saying he would oppose both Carter's and attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch's confirmation.\n\n\"After careful review, I've decided to vote against President Obama's nominees for both the departments of defense and justice. Unfortunately, I believe both of these nominees will simply continue to uphold President Obama's flawed agenda at these important agencies.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., also voted against Carter's confirmation.\n\nBoth U.S. Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., supported Carter.\n\nFor her part, McCaskill said she was \"thrilled\" with Carter's selection, telling Politico that Carter now heads a \"dream team of wonkiness\" at the Defense Department.\n\nCarter has held numerous positions with at the Pentagon including, serving as a former deputy defense secretary. Unlike outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Carter is seen as a technocrat willing to take a serious look at issues of waste and inefficiency and to challenge big-ticket spending on military equipment and systems seen by some at the Pentagon as unnecessary.\n\nMcCaskill applauds Carter's expertise and detailed understanding of the defense acquisition process saying it will allow him to deal with some of the department's more complicated problems.\n\nDurbin also praised Carter, singling out his work at the Rock Island Arsenal.\n\n\"In our discussions I was pleased to hear his appreciation for the organic industrial base - especially one near and dear to my heart: the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois,\" Durbin said. \"He recalled his experiences in Afghanistan as he tried to bring our troops the body armor and the armored vehicles they needed. He recalled working alongside the great employees - the dedicated employees - at the Rock Island Arsenal as they delivered the necessary life-saving equipment to our troops and rolled it off their assembly lines in record time.\"\n\nLynch nomination\n\nThursday, Durbin also called on the Senate to take up Lynch's nomination, noting that \"it's been 95 days since the president announced the nomination.\"\n\n\"This is longer than any other attorney general nominee has had to wait in recent memory,\" Durbin said, adding that when Democrats controlled the Senate, they confirmed Michael Mukasey as President George W. Bush's attorney general in 50 days. Mukasey held that post from November 2007 until the end of Bush's term in January 2009.\n\n\"Nobody's questioned her record as a federal prosecutor,\" said Durbin. \"She's twice before been unanimously confirmed to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District for New York. She has been vetted and examined and questioned to a fare-thee-well.\"\n\nDurbin added that Lynch had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for nearly eight hours, \"answering every question and including 600 written questions that were sent to her. It's time to move forward and confirm this obviously well-qualified and historic nominee.\" (If confirmed, Lynch would be the first African-American woman to serve as attorney general.)\n\nBlunt's office did not return an email late Thursday afternoon asking whether he had any other concerns about Lynch's qualifications to do the job of attorney general.\n\nLynch's confirmation vote may not come before the Senate before Feb. 26 and possibly not until next month, as lawmakers are set to leave Washington Friday to begin a one-week break.",

His name sounds similar to that of popular actor Ashton Kutcher, leading to confessions of momentary confusion and jokes about an actor known for hosting a show about elaborate pranks now dealing with foreign foes.\n\nJust got a new alert that I swear to god said Ashton Kutcher was confirmed as Defense Secretary. -- Brian Brown (@9six7) February 12, 2015\n\nCongrats to Ashton Kutcher for his new Secretary of Defense job. Let's see any terrorists try to attack us now without gettin Punk'd -- Abby. Yep (@abbycohenwl) February 12, 2015\n\nTo review, Ashton Kutcher is an actor and director and the co-founder of the site APlus.com, which is a site that \"features stories that make a difference and create positive change.\" He is best know for comedies \"That '70s Show\" and \"Two and a Half Men,\" and, of course, MTV's \"Punk'd.\" Ashton Carter is a Yale-trained physicist who has held many positions at the Pentagon, including deputy secretary of defense from 2011 to 2013. But the name similarity makes for a good gag:\n\ncan't believe ashton kutcher is secretary of defense -- Tony Fratto (@TonyFratto) February 12, 2015\n\nAshton Carter new defense secretary? Beats Ashton Kutcher, I guess... or Aaron Carter. -- hank flynn (@ChasingHank) February 12, 2015\n\nI can't believe Ashton Kutcher is going to be Secretary of Defense. He has no military experience. Obama has really lost it.\n\n-- Conor Gilles (@ConorGilles) February 12, 2015\n\nI like Ashton Kutcher just fine, I just don't know if he's going to make the best defense secretary. -- Tracy Mayor (@mommyprayers) February 12, 2015\n\nThere aren't many well-known Ashtons out there currently, helping to confuse things. But the name is growing more popular. Thirty years ago, \"Ashton\" was 578 on the most popular names list for babies in the U.S., according to BabyCenter, which uses U.S. Census data. So far in 2015, it's climbed the charts to the 68th spot.",

But, as I elaborated for CQ.com subscribers, few of those skills have the time or means to come into play.\n\nAmong the challenges he'll confront in bringing his expertise to bear: the larger federal government tax and spending fight; Congress' prior resistance to some Pentagon budget proposals; the flare-up of conflict in Iraq and what it means for Afghanistan; and the fact that he'll only get to shape one budget before President Obama's departure.\n\nThe full piece delves into each of those subjects.

You're good.\"\n\nCarter's visit to Newnan was part of his tour called \"Operation Feedback\", which involves visits to 30 towns and cities in Georgia and covers more than 1,500 miles.\n\nCarter said that the goals of the tour are to find out how the state programs are working, to see what Georgia people think about the programs and to find out what Georgians would like to see accomplished during the legislative session of his term.\n\n\"I don't have enough opportunities to get out where people live and work and to go up and down the street of Georgia as I did when I campaigned for this office,\" said Carter.\n\n\"Hearing what people have to say to me,\" he said, \"rather than deciding what to say to them, is what concerns me on this trip.\"\n\nWith his wife Rosalyn, Carter visited The Newnan Times Herald, The Community Treatment Center for Youth on Jackson Street and the Coweta Chamber of Commerce.\n\nDuring this tour, Carter said that he has talked with many Georgians who are concerned mainly with three areas. The first area is that of land development. He said that citizens are interested in the economic and environment issues involved in land development.\n\n\"They are concerned about development of land in an unplanned way that might have a bad effect on the people nearby,\" said Carter.\n\nHe said that people also voiced their concern about health problems and law enforcement. Citizens are asking for help in paying for the high cost of medical treatment, according to Carter and are also concerned about the current drug problem\n\n\"I am in favor of requiring life imprisonment sentences for drug pushers selling addictive drugs or serious drugs that make addicts out of the people using them,\" said Carter.",

                    "body": "Whatever happened to Aaron Carter? The blonde, bouncy little brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter recorded a song with Shaq, toured the world with his brother's group, and dated Hilary Duff, all before the age of 14. And then he all disappeared from the teen-idol radar.\n\nOf course, he's still around, touring small venues and making music, trading on memories of his former celebrity. In fact, as I found out recently, if you write about Carter online, you'll be inundated with stories of his post-stardom career, claiming that the former idol will desperately try to get with any girl whose nostalgia might drive her to fuck Aaron Carter -- even some who might be underage.\n\nBeing a sucker for nostalgia myself, I enjoy keeping up with Carter's Instagram posts -- they are, at least, the closest I'll ever get to another season of The Surreal Life. After Carter posted a picture of himself cradling his old Sidekick, I jokingly reposted it on my blog Pop Culture Died in 2009 with a caption relating to his sad career.\n\nWhat followed was something I didn't expect: a huge swath of my readers sending me stories of Aaron Carter being a huge creep. Within hours of my post, I had received dozens of messages from girls who claim they had met Aaron or knew someone who had.\n\nCarter's career peaked at the age of 13, when his singles \"Aaron's Party (Come and Get It)\" and \"That's How I Beat Shaq\" -- buoyed by the Disney Channel, who promoted Carter's music heavily and briefly turned him into a young heartthrob -- both hit the Billboard charts. The former became a certified gold record. But just as he reached puberty, Carter's career devolved into family troubles and lawsuits, including one he filed in 2002 against legendary sleazeball and boy band sugar daddy Lou Pearlman, who Carter accused of stealing hundreds of thousand of dollars (and who was rumored to have molested a number of his clients).\n\nSoon after, his music career fizzled. Like many washed-up former teen idols, Carter tried his hand at renewed relevance through reality TV. House of Carters, a reality show that aired on E! in the network's pre-Kardashian era, was a bust, though it did include a memorable, and still-frequently-replayed scene of Aaron and his brother fist-fighting over Paris Hilton. Eventually Carter landed a spot on Dancing with the Stars, the most prominent island for celebrity castaways. In the show's ninth season, he finished fifth.\n\nSince then, nothing has stuck. His current claim to fame is probably the frequency with which he tweets about how horny he is, a subject that was covered in great detail in 2013 by Buzzfeed. In an interview with Katie Notopolous, Carter explained a tweet stating that he was \"extremely sexual right now\" by saying that he \"was just REALLY horny.\" About an earlier tweet that read \"Ok honestly, I'm not even outside I just wanna talk about boobies\" Carter said \"You know, I'm 25, I'm not in a relationship, I'm just a ravenous creature right now. I love women. A lot.\"\n\n(If public horniness isn't the quality Carter is currently known for, maybe it's being his ex-girlfriend Hilary Duff's quasi-stalker. Every few months Carter professes his love for her on some social media site, but it isn't 2003, no matter how much he wants to believe it is.)\n\nThe fact that Carter describes himself as \"ravenous\" makes the stories I received from readers who claimed to have met him all the more believable. Initially, many were from people who say Aaron Carter hit on them using social media (obviously, I can't confirm the veracity of any of them):\n\n\"I live in Arkansas and there's a really embarrassing girl here that thinks she's hot shit because she snapchats Aaron carter... Like sweet dude! He's also like way older, yikes.\"\n\n\"sent aaron carter a DM on Instagram about how he should concentrate on music instead of under aged girls. so he cursed me out and blocked me like a pussy.\"\n\n\"wait are we still sharing Aaron Carter stories? because once he followed me on Twitter and dmed me and like started flirting and after I told him I didn't wanted anything he blocked me\"\n\n\"I went to HS with a girl who tweeted Aaron a lot because he was going to come to Houston and he followed her back and she was so excited posted about it everywhere. Anyways she went and got back stage and I heard they still text. she was like 17 and this was two years ago?? Gross. He looks so washed up. Like a blonde kfed to me.\"\n\nThen, I started getting messages of alleged encounters with Carter himself:\n\n\"I have a story about Aaron carter! The same thing happened to one of my friends she got Aaron's number from someone else and they started texting and she sent him nudes and they hooked up and after she was like just wondering what's up with your obsession with Hilary? And he kicked her out of his hotel room\"\n\n\"I saw him too at a show in LA and did the same thing. Expect the last girl didn't want to make out with him because he just had his tongue in 2 other girls mouths.\"\n\n\"Aaron Carter was in Chicago for market days and I found him after his set and gave him a blowjob. He looked like he was tweaking the fuck out but I was hella drunk so it was fine\"\n\n\"just to contribute to the aaron carter nonsense: my friend courtney saw him in october and there's a really awkward picture of her/him at a meet and greet where he grabbed her and went to kiss her and she luckily swerved to avoid it... she's 21, so it's not as creepy as some of these stories, but still\"\n\nAaron carter grabbed my ass when I went to his show last year. He's actual trash\n\n\"Aaron Carter came to my town during the summer of 2013 and a friend asked me to go with her (unironically, I might add). I couldn't go, but she sent me a bunch of pics apparently taken from the stage of the crowd and there were about 40 people there. She also said she saw him at a bar next door to the venue a little later and he was wasted, talking shit, and tryna get with any girl that looked at him.\"\n\nThen sorority stories became the focus:\n\n\"I have a story about Aaron Carter. A girl in my sorority spent Easter 2013 with him she's in one of his Instagram pictures from that day, and has pictures with him on Facebook. She had sex with him and stayed with him at his hotel in Denver, after paying to bowl with him. All I know is he started hitting on her during this VIP Bowling party, which she paid $100 to go to. Then by the end of the night, he asked her to put her number in his phone. (actually asked her to tell his assistant to do it, HA) Later that night he started texting her and he wanted her to come back to his hotel, and the rest is history.\"\n\n\"Aaron Carter came to my friends sorority this year for a meet and greet and he was supposed to come out and do a concert type thing but then he got caught having sex with one of the girls in the house and was asked to leave and got all mad and caused a scene and kept saying IM AARON CARTER DONT YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!?\"\n\n\"I only know this through the grape vine but Aaron Carter came to Chico, Ca to do a performance and after went to a party with some sorority girls and did a bunch of coke with them.\"\n\nIncluding one claim that he attempted to drug a sorority girl at a party:\n\nhey so about aaron carter according to my cousin he went to her college and once at a party she caught him trying to roofie her roommate and she stopped him before he could thank god but rumor has it that he did roofie a girl at that party\n\nThere were a few messages about one incident in particular at Ohio University:\n\n\"According to my bestie who goes to Ohio U Aaron carter almost got arrested in Athens last summer at a party in the Blue House (very large place with very large parties, I had to show a guy guarding the door my tits to get in once) She said he also got kicked out of one of the bars.... Ohio does not like Aaron Carter anymore.\"\n\n\"This is 100% true My BFF goes to Ohio u and Aaron came and did a terrible concert with a shitty turnout then went bar hopping and kept trying to make VINES WITH ALL THE GIRLS and he was bothering my friends friends so he hit on him to make him leave\"\n\nTo that, one reader added:\n\n\"He does this at literally every college performance he puts on.\"\n\nThe above stories, if they're true, are gross and sad. But as story after story came in, the girls allegedly being contacted by Carter got younger and younger:\n\n\"Aaron Carter is a grade A scumbag, for sure! He came to Athens, OH for a concert and shit-talked Hilary in the most passive way, he made out with like four high schoolers and kept telling the crowd how awesome he was. Everyone felt super uncomfortable and my friend even took a selfie with the crowd. No one was amused. It was honestly pathetic.\"\n\n\"Haha Aaron carter is such a scumbag! He had a \"concert\" in Seattle last year and my moms friends kid went to the show (16yrs old) and she got invited back stage. They kissed and he signed her underwear. They texted the entire night and I'm p sure actually had sex eventually.\"\n\n\"aaron carter is trash. last year he came to my city & took my underage friend (16 at the time) to a motel 6 & tried to have a threesome... she ended up blowing him. then this year he came to the hard rock cafe ( lmfao.) tickets were $10 so me & 3 friends went because it was cheap & it would be funny. We were the only ones there as a joke. When he called someone up on stage he picked me & whispered in my ear \"kiss me.\" I just laughed in his face so he took me off stage. He made me so uncomfortable\"\n\n\"I met aaron carter at a meet n greet of some sort in my hometown when I was 11 and he had the idea to give me his autograph on my underage butt on my wet seal jeans in lime green sharpie #romance\"\n\n\"there seems to be a reoccurring theme with aaron carter...a friend of a friend also met him at a concert (when he came down to sing to her and danced with her for one whole song) ((btw-she was probably 17, maybe 18 at the time)) but it's funny how in almost every story, it's a young girl he does this stuff too. like high school, barely college.\"\n\nAaron carter has slept with my friends sister on multiple occasions, and I'm not sure if he slept with her when she was underage but He DEFINITELY creeps on young girls he is creepy and disgusting please spread at least that around\n\nRecently on his Instagram, Carter has been posting more pictures of himself hanging out with girls outside his European shows. Drake Bell, a former teen sensation himself, commented on one. He wrote: \"Like a Boss!\"",

                    "body": "Okanagan College Media Release\n\nA generous gift by a local family will help support the creation of two new study spaces at Okanagan College, as part of the $33-million project to renovate and expand the institution's trades training complex.\n\nAl Carter, a well-known auto industry pioneer in Kelowna, has donated $50,000 to support the construction of two group study rooms in the new trades building, which is slated to open in spring of 2016. The study rooms will help meet the demand for student space as the College works to train and educate the tradespeople to address a government-projected shortage of skilled trades workers over the next decade.\n\n\"Our family has always been a strong supporter of apprenticeship,\" says Carter. \"We've had many Okanagan College alumni working in our auto repair shops over the years -- including John Haller, former Dean of Trades. We think the apprenticeship process is a wonderful thing and we're proud to support trades training at the College.\"\n\n\"We know that labour shortages for the trades sector as a whole are expected as early as 2016 -- with the Government of Canada predicting that our workforce will need one million additional skilled workers by 2020,\" says Jim Hamilton, President of Okanagan College. \"We are grateful to the Carter family for investing in our College's future and helping us to provide students with state-of-the-art spaces to learn and succeed.\"\n\nAfter service in the Royal Canadian Air Force, Al Carter's automotive career began in Vancouver in 1948 when he opened Carter Brothers Texaco Service with his brother, Ken. Over the next 15 years, he moved up the ranks to become sales manager of Marshall Pontiac Buick. Carter moved his family to Kelowna in 1961, opening up Carter Pontiac and Buick dealership early the following year on the corner of Pandosy and Lawrence.\n\n\"When you think about the change in Kelowna since then, it's incredible\" says Carter. \"There were 12,600 people here when we started our first business and look at it now. It's been great to watch the city grow, and with it the College and the opportunities for students.\"\n\nStarting each of his businesses from scratch taught Carter and his sons some valuable lessons, he says.\n\n\"There is a big difference between buying an established business and building one from scratch,\" explains Carter. \"Those early days were tough. We worked hard for everything we earned.\"\n\n\"One piece of advice that I've always had for people starting out in any trade,\" adds Carter, \"is to keep learning. Learn your job well, and then learn the next job up. If you show that you're hungry to learn, and that you want to keep building your skills, employers will take notice.\"\n\nCarter still recalls his sons Barry and Greg helping him in 1968 to clear the land on the corner of Spall and Harvey, which was an orchard at the time, for what would later become the first Honda dealership in Kelowna in 1974.\n\nOne of the family's motivations for supporting the trades complex was to help Okanagan College to get trades training on the radar of students who otherwise might not have considered trades for a career, noted Al's eldest son, Barry.\n\n\"Our goal is to help the College build a foundation for future growth,\" explains Barry. \"Getting people into trades is perhaps more important now than ever before. Just look at the current workforce and the big wave of retirements we're facing.\"\n\n\"We're going to have a real shortage of trades people, if we don't help new apprentices get started,\" noted Al's younger son, Greg.\n\nThe new complex will accommodate approximately 2,400 students annually in a range of trades programs. The Okanagan College Foundation launched the Bright Horizons, Building for Skills fundraising campaign in fall 2014 to raise the necessary $7 million to complete the project and help provide equipment and student support. The provincial government has committed $28 million.\n\nThe Foundation is inviting the community to learn more about the project and opportunities to get involved, by visiting www.okanagan.bc.ca/campaign.",

                    "body": "The usually quiet Carter-Williams embraced his new role, shouting instructions, encouragement and sometimes criticism toward his teammates. By the time the trade deadline sale came, he was firmly planted in his role.\n\n\"I thought he was really mature,\" said Turner, now with the Boston Celtics. \"I don't think he tried to come in and make it about himself. He tried his best to fit in. I think he was great defensively and he knew how to play the game. The biggest thing was that he came in and he tried to fit in. He didn't try to get people to adjust to him, he wanted to fit in. That's a big thing, especially coming out of college. Sometimes you get a little lofty. But he means well and in a lot of moments you could tell he was really more about winning than anything else. That's his biggest thing and that's what I truly liked about him. I think he had a lot of aspects of becoming a leader.\"\n\nLike last year, there are still hurdles. Carter-Williams turned the ball over way too much last season, averaging 4.2 a game. His shot also needs plenty of work. And, sometimes his shot selection is a bit questionable.\n\nWhile those things stick out, you can't help but wonder how good he will be when Hinkie's Plan starts coming to fruition. Carter-Williams is terrific at getting defenders on his hip during his forays into the lane. Should he have Joel Embiid to dish to or a couple of good long-distant shooters spotted up, perhaps those turnovers and poor shot choices will go down and the assists will go up.\n\nHis maturity has shown lately, after a bit of a low point in the season. After a humiliating 35-point loss in Washington on Jan. 19, Nerlens Noel had some choice words about the big men not getting the ball enough. It seemed to be a direct shot at MCW, though the two blew it off the next day. In that game, Carter-Williams shot just 2-for-13, turned the ball over four times and collected only five assists. He then attempted 26 shots the next game, making 10 in a loss to the lowly New York Knicks.\n\nHe's been more selective and productive since then. In the last even games he has played (he has missed the past three with a strained right big toe) Carter-Williams has led the team to a 3-4 record while averaging 11.9 points, 8.6 assists and 6.7 rebounds. He has done that while averaging just 11 shots a game.\n\n\"When he distributes, he's unreal,\" said Turner. \"I think there are a lot of point guards in this league who are trying to be scorers, when they're not. What sets him aside is his ability to make passes and get his teammates involved. I think he's staying positive through this situation and a few more years down the line I think he's going to benefit even more from these rough times and keep going.\n\n\"I think Brett did a great job of being patient with him while he developed. That's a big thing. At the same time, that first game of his really gave him confidence. That was huge for him. They have the right guys on the coaching staff to make sure he's comfortable. The most important thing is that he listens. He takes one thing at a time and he has a bigger picture mentality.\"\n\n\"Imagine him when he fully fills out,\" said Brown. \"He will easily get up to 200 pounds or so. Then, when he goes to the basket, right at the rim, he's going to have a lot of positive results. And when you think about Joel being down in the post and Nerlens running down the lane and perhaps a couple of spot shooters waiting in the corners . . . And he is so long on defense. He can be really good there for a really long time, too.\"\n\nIf it all comes together the way the coach envisions, maybe that stat line he posted in his first game will become somewhat normal for Carter-Williams.",

Getting the kids outside of the classroom and bringing history alive is what really makes this job fun.\"\n\nGarner decided to make this trip happen when he noticed Carter would be speaking at to the church close to President's Day.\n\n\"The trip was an idea that presented itself at the right time ... I knew that it was an opportunity that I didn't want my students to miss,\" he said.\n\nHe was able to have the trip sponsored, making it a minimal cost to the students and said even though the field trip took 12 hours total, it was a worthwhile endeavour.\n\n\"Getting to watch Jimmy Carter deliver a message to us that related to modern events really spoke to me considering he is a former president,\" said NHS student Erica Kornegay. \"Jimmy Carter's delivery really made it a point to make each of us feel special,\" said Chancellor Johnson, another NHS student. \"It was really cool to get to meet him.\"\n\nStudent Noah Bridges said his favorite part of the day was \"seeing how President Carter never forgot his roots even though he was the most powerful man in the world at one time.\"\n\nAfter visiting with Carter, Garner and the students went to Warm Springs and visited former U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Little White House, where he visited hoping to find a cure for his polio. The warm water did not cure him, but it did bring him some improvement.\n\n\"We toured the home where we got to meet a 'young lady' who spoke to President Roosevelt as a young child in her daddy's front yard during one of FDR's famous visits along the back country roads of Georgia,\" he said. \"Additionally, we got to see the picture that was being painted of Roosevelt when he died on April 12, 1945.\"\n\n\"Visiting the place where FDR made many important decisions during his presidency was a great experience,\" said NHS student Danielle Bray.",

But still: the intent is clear and it's to prevent the U.S. from engaging in ground combat against ISIS even if there is no good tactical alternative to such action.\" It's just words, a blizzard of words tossed around in lieu of a war strategy.\n\nA pointed bipartisan letter to Secretary of State John Kerry from the chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee: \"The United States should pursue a different approach with the Pakistani Government. We urge you to consider implementing travel restrictions, suspending portions of assistance, and sanctioning Pakistani officials that maintain relationships with designated terrorist groups. Such an approach would make clear that the U.S. and Pakistan cannot have a true strategic partnership until Pakistan cuts all ties with terrorist organizations and renounces its use as an instrument of state policy.\"\n\nSen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) tries running point for Dems on an effective approach to Ukraine: \"There can be no let-up in the sanctions regime and the U.S. should move forward and establish deeper security ties with Ukraine and other vulnerable countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. Sanctions helped to bring Putin to the negotiating table and we should maintain this pressure until we are confident that Ukraine's territorial integrity has been fully restored, including Crimea.\" Good luck, senator.\n\nThere is no point in talking common sense to pols who live in their own parallel universe. \"Rand Paul using his speech at American Spectator dinner to recount how the 2013 gov[ernment] shutdown proved conservatives right.\" Good grief.\n\nIf we are going to point fingers, what about those NBC News execs? \"[Tom] Brokaw's told colleagues, going back at least a year, that he heard [Brian] Williams giving increasingly grandiose versions of the downed Iraqi helicopter story that got him into trouble in recent days, and that Brokaw himself looked into the anecdote and that the facts simply didn't match.\"\n\nI don't think we are quite at the point where there is a frontrunner, but Jeb Bush is the closest one to it: \"There are huge question marks surrounding Bush, from his controversial surname to positions on issues that may be deal-stoppers for conservative early-state voters. Yet big donors are lining up behind him and top political staffers are signing up for campaign jobs. He's become the man to beat practically out of the starting block -- an enviable position but one that's put a bulls-eye on his back.\"\n\nThere is no point in getting our hopes up, since his boss is not going anywhere. \"Ashton B. Carter, a physicist with long experience in national security circles, handily won Senate confirmation Thursday as secretary of defense, becoming President Obama's fourth pick in six years to lead the Pentagon. The Senate voted 93 to 5 to approve Carter's nomination, paving the way for him to be sworn into office sometime in the next few days.\"",

Bolin, 20, of Valley Springs, was traveling west on Swiss Ranch Road east of Miller Ranch Road at about 50 mph when Bolin lost control of the truck.\n\nThe truck overturned and struck a pole. None of the vehicle's occupants was wearing a seatbelt, according to the CHP.\n\nAnna Carter, 25, of Mountain Ranch, suffered fatal injuries. Calaveras County Coroner Kevin Raggio identified Carter Wednesday afternoon after her family was notified of the accident.\n\nHer stepbrother, Bob Niederbrach, said that Carter was born in Sonora but grew up in Calaveras County. He said she worked at the O'Reilly Auto Parts store in Jackson.\n\n\"The thing that represented her was high heels and flip flops,\" Niederbrach said. \"And she loved 4-by-4s and mud.\"\n\nNiederbrach said his sister was an avid outdoorswoman. \"And yet at the same time she was a girly girl, too.\"\n\nCarter is a 2007 graduate of Calaveras High School. Her father, Bob Carter, works as a mechanic for Calaveras County Water District, said CCWD Director of Operations Bill Perley.\n\n\"She's a good kid,\" Perley said of Anna Carter.\n\nAmanda Ramos of San Andreas, a long-time friend of Carter, said that Carter had an adventurous spirit and an outgoing personality.\n\n\"She loved to be outside and eventually wanted to become a park ranger,\" Ramos said.\n\n\"She loved her family more than anything else in this world, and most would call her a daddy's girl,\" Ramos said. \"Her smile was contagious, and her laugh was unforgettable. She is someone that will forever live in our hearts.\"\n\nThere were two other passengers, besides Carter and Bolin, in the truck.\n\nThe CHP reported that Jason Leatherman, 20, of San Andreas, suffered moderate injuries but refused medical treatment. Attempts to reach Leatherman on Wednesday were unsuccessful. According to Calaveras Enterprise news accounts, Leatherman was formerly an all-star player on the Calaveras High School football team.\n\nThe fourth passenger in the truck was Robert J. Prater, 21, of Stockton, the CHP said. The CHP report did not list any injuries for Prater.\n\nAccording to the CHP report, Bolin was under the influence of alcohol and that is what caused him to lose control of the truck. The CHP said Bolin was taken to a hospital for examination before he was cleared for booking at the jail.\n\nAlthough the CHP report said that Bolin was booked into jail on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter, the Calaveras County Sheriff's Office later reported that he was booked on suspicion of murder.\n\nBolin declined a request to be interviewed at the Calaveras County Jail Wednesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when Bolin would appear in court for arraignment. Although California law requires that those being held in jail must be arraigned within 48 hours, that time period does not count weekends and holidays. Because of court holidays on Thursday and again Monday, it might be Tuesday before Bolin first appears before a judge.",

Tambi\u00e9n ocup\u00f3 la jefatura de la secci\u00f3n de compra de armas del Departamento de Defensa desde el 2009 al 2011, cuando llev\u00f3 adelante una extensa reestructuraci\u00f3n del programa de los cazas F-35.\n\nEn su audiencia de confirmaci\u00f3n del 4 de febrero, Carter subray\u00f3 su determinaci\u00f3n de impulsar el presupuesto de defensa de Estados Unidos, disminuir el costo de nuevas armas y asegurarse de que las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas sean entregadas a las tropas con rapidez.\n\nTambi\u00e9n dijo a los legisladores que se inclinaba por entregar armas a Ucrania, pero luego advirti\u00f3 que los esfuerzos de la comunidad internacional para manejar la crisis deben continuar centr\u00e1ndose en presionar a Rusia econ\u00f3mica y pol\u00edticamente.\n\nCarter ser\u00e1 el cuarto secretario de Defensa de Obama y reemplazar\u00e1 a Chuck Hagel, quien renunci\u00f3 bajo presi\u00f3n el a\u00f1o pasado.\n\n(Reporte de Patricia Zengerle, editado en espa\u00f1ol por Patricia Avila)",

                    "body": "Hace unas semanas, el general Martin Dempsey, la m\u00e1s alta autoridad militar de las Fuerzas Armadas estadounidenses, declar\u00f3 que su pa\u00eds no gozaba de la supremac\u00eda en la esfera cibern\u00e9tica, muy al contrario de lo que todav\u00eda ocurre en el resto de los \u00e1mbitos de operaciones. Y es que tal y como sucede en todas las Fuerzas Armada avanzadas, las estadounidenses dependen de las tecnolog\u00edas de la informaci\u00f3n y las comunicaciones (TIC) para planear y conducir sus operaciones militares. De hecho, por el ciberespacio militar circulan tanto las coordenadas sobre las que situar en cualquier punto del globo sus unidades militares, la informaci\u00f3n procedente de sus medios de reconocimiento, las \u00f3rdenes que deben ejecutarse, las coordenadas de los blancos a batir, los datos para dirigir sus drones y armas con precisi\u00f3n hacia sus objetivos o la informaci\u00f3n log\u00edstica necesaria para sostener cualquier operaci\u00f3n militar. De hecho, el flujo de informaci\u00f3n que deben soportar diariamente las redes p\u00fablicas y clasificadas del Pent\u00e1gono es tal que se ha convertido en un problema de dif\u00edcil soluci\u00f3n y una de las principales amenazas para la operatividad futura de las Fuerzas Armadas del pa\u00eds.\n\nLas redes militares estadounidenses no s\u00f3lo deben protegerse de unos ciberataques enemigos cada vez m\u00e1s numerosos y potencialmente peligrosos, sino tambi\u00e9n de la imparable demanda de informaci\u00f3n necesaria para el funcionamiento diario de sus fuerzas. Y es que tal y como puso de manifiesto la Armada hace meses, sus fuerzas desplegadas est\u00e1n empezando a tener problemas de ancho de banda, puesto que sus redes clasificadas son incapaces de satisfacer toda la transmisi\u00f3n de datos necesaria de sus sistemas militares.\n\nA d\u00eda de hoy, se estima que las Fuerzas Armadas estadounidenses tienen una demanda de ancho de banda de 24 Gigabits por segundo, aunque muchos estudios independientes alertan que en los pr\u00f3ximos cinco a\u00f1os esta necesidad se incrementar\u00e1 en un 70% hasta alcanzar los 41 Gigabits por segundo, algo que las actuales redes no podr\u00e1n soportar. Del mismo modo, se estima que solamente el 22% de las comunicaciones estrat\u00e9gicas del pa\u00eds utilizan su propia red de sat\u00e9lites militares, mientras que el 78% restante emplean sat\u00e9lites comerciales con un coste anual de m\u00e1s de 1.800 millones de euros. La \u00faltima Revisi\u00f3n Cuatrienal de la Defensa, presentada en marzo del a\u00f1o pasado, traza las l\u00edneas maestras de la pol\u00edtica de defensa y la organizaci\u00f3n militar estadounidense hasta 2018, alerta de esta situaci\u00f3n y plantea varias medidas encaminadas tanto a incrementar la capacidad de transmisi\u00f3n de datos de las infraestructuras cibern\u00e9ticas del pa\u00eds como para minimizar el impacto que podr\u00eda tener la paralizaci\u00f3n de las redes en la operatividad de las Fuerzas Armadas. Si la Armada estadounidense tiene hoy estos problemas de ancho de banda, en un futuro no demasiado lejano \u00e9stos se incrementar\u00e1n de forma exponencial a medida que los aviones de combate sean reemplazados por drones y los buques de superficie sean complementados por sistemas submarinos y de superficie no-tripulados. La Fuerza A\u00e9rea y el Ej\u00e9rcito de Tierra se hallan en una situaci\u00f3n similar: la generalizaci\u00f3n del empleo de proyectiles de precisi\u00f3n e inteligentes y la progresiva introducci\u00f3n de robots en el campo de batalla requiere unos vol\u00famenes de informaci\u00f3n que dif\u00edcilmente las redes actuales podr\u00e1n proporcionar y gestionar.\n\nDe hecho, esta es una de las preocupaciones que se halla detr\u00e1s de la denominada Tercera Estrategia de Compensaci\u00f3n que, recientemente planteada por el ya saliente Secretario de Defensa Chuck Hagel, pretende explotar las capacidades tecnol\u00f3gicas del pa\u00eds para incrementar la brecha militar entre Estados Unidos y sus adversarios a la vez que garantizar la capacidad para proyectar su poder militar a cualquier punto del planeta con independencia de las defensas enemigas. Evidentemente, si Washington pretende lograr este objetivo, los requerimientos en materia de conectividad, redes proyectables, comunicaciones por sat\u00e9lite y ancho de banda se incrementar\u00e1n infinitamente m\u00e1s de lo imaginado, e impondr\u00e1n nuevos condicionantes a la hora de plantear y conducir las operaciones.\n\nSin embargo, la necesidad de ancho de banda y la dependencia de las redes de informaci\u00f3n y comunicaciones no es s\u00f3lo un problema de las Fuerzas Armadas estadounidenses, es un problema que afecta a todos los ej\u00e9rcitos avanzados; por lo que si no se aborda pronto, su operatividad se ver\u00e1 severamente reducida.\n\nEnrique Foj\u00f3n Chamorro y Guillem Colom Piella, miembros de Thiber, think tank sobre ciberseguridad.",
