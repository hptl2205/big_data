                    "body": "FIFA President Sepp Blatter gestures as he speaks during the opening ceremony of the 65th FIFA Congress in Zurich on Thursday, May 28, 2015. UEFA president Michel Platini confronted FIFA leader Sepp Blatter on Thursday and called on him to stand down because of corruption scandals engulfing world soccer. Blatter refused and Platini made a public appeal for member nations to vote against Blatter for the FIFA presidency in an election on May 29.\n\nZURICH \u00e2\u0080\" Text from FIFA President Sepp Blatter's speech on Thursday at the opening of the FIFA congress:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will agree with me, these are unprecedented and difficult times for FIFA. The events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and over this week's congress.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cActions of individuals bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all. We cannot allow the reputation of football and FIFA to be dragged through the mud any longer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has to stop here and now. I know many people hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and reputation of the global football community, whether it's a decision for the hosting of a World Cup, or a corruption scandal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe, or I, cannot monitor everyone all of the time. If people want to do wrong they will also try to hide it, but it must fall to me to bear the responsibility for the reputation and well-being of our organization, and to find a way forward to fix things.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not allow the actions of a few to destroy the hard work and integrity of the vast majority of those who work so hard for football. I must stress that those who are corrupt in football are in a tiny minority, like in society. But like in society they must be catched (sic) and held responsible for their actions. Football cannot be the exception to the rule. That is our responsibility at FIFA, and we will co-operate with all authorities to make sure anyone involved in wrongdoing, from top to bottom, is discovered and punished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere can be no place for corruption of any kind. The next few months will not be easy for FIFA. I'm sure more bad news will follow. But it is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organization.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet this be the turning point. More needs to be done to make sure everyone in football behaves responsibly and ethically, and everywhere, also outside of the field of play, where there is no referee, no boundaries and no time limit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFootball, the fans, the players, the clubs, the world, deserve so much more. And we must respond tomorrow. Tomorrow, the congress, we have the opportunity to begin on what will be a long and difficult road to rebuilding trust. We have lost their trust, at least a part of it, and we must now earn it back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must earn it back through the decisions we make, through the expectations we place on each other and through the way we behave individually.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that brings me to tonight's ceremony. You have seen that the opening ceremony is about football. The spirit of the game. The aspect of football that make it so loved by so many. Our cast of artists and dancers will bring the spirit to life tonight and I thank them all for their hard work in preparing for this show under these special circumstances. I'm sure you will agree they are a great and talented cast and crew. It is important that we do not lose sight of the spirit of football. I hope that this show will remind us what we are fighting for, and why we must continue to fight for positive change in football even when some among us let us down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo please enjoy our show, enjoy it. But I ask you also to reflect on why a vast majority, we are all in football and we like this game, not for greed, not for exploit (sic), not for power, but because of love for the game, for this game, to serve others and to achieve positive change through responsible leadership.\n\nSolidarity and unity is asked for the game, for the world, for peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The actions of individuals bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all,\" the 79-year-old said, refusing to accept responsibility for the FIFA officials who were involved in racketeering, money laundering and bribery under his watch.\n\nAfter the 2018/2022 World Cup bribery scandal rocked FIFA in 2010, Blatter had opened the 2011 congress at which he was re-elected by saying with similar remarks denying any crisis.\n\nIt was a similar refrain on Thursday, as if four years of a scandal-ridden reforms process had never happened.\n\nBlatter bizarrely painted himself as the savior of world football's governing body a day after the US Department of Justice highlighted the culture of corruption that he has allowed to flourish since he took office in 1998.\n\n\"We cannot allow the reputation of football and FIFA to be dragged through the mud any longer. It has to stop here and now,\" he said.\n\nWith calls for him to resign from some of football's stakeholders, including UEFA president Michel Platini, he acknowledged that \"many people hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and reputation of the global football community whether on decisions for hosting of World Cups or a corruption scandal\".\n\nThe FIFA chief, who faces a presidential challenge from Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein in Friday's election, then promptly failed to accept total responsibility.\n\n\"We or I cannot monitor everyone all of the time. If people want to do wrong they will also try to hide it.\"\n\nAs he did in 2011, when he dug into his book of maritime metaphors saying he wanted to right FIFA's ship that was in \"troubled waters\", Blatter said he wanted to \"find a way forward to fix things\".\n\nFIFA's reputation was in tatters on Wednesday when the US Department of Justice charged 14 football and marketing officials with 47 counts of corruption. \"The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the United States,\" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nYet Blatter shrugged off the scandal, telling congress delegates that corrupt football officials \"are in the minority\" and should be held responsible for their actions.\n\n\"There can be no place for corruption of any kind.\"\n\nAs if Friday's election is a foregone conclusion, which it is not following the latest corruption storm, Blatter appeared to take on the mantle of reformer once again. His discredited reforms process launched in 2011 apparently a distant memory.\n\n\"The next few months will not be easy for FIFA. I am sure more bad news may follow but it is necessary to begin rebuilding the trust in our organization,\" he said.\n\n\"Let this be the turning point. More needs to be done to make sure people in football behave ethically and responsibly. Football, the fans, the players, the clubs, the world deserves so much more.\"\n\n\"And we must respond tomorrow,\" he added. \"We have the opportunity to begin on a long and difficult road to rebuilding trust. We have lost their trust or at least a big part of it and we must now earn it back.... through the decisions we make and expectations we place on each other and the way we behave individually.\"",

Today we will find out whether he will win an unprecedented fifth term in charge of football's world governing body.\n\nThe man charged with ousting him from office is Prince Ali of Jordan, with a wave of support building following the dawn raids and subsequent revelations about corruption in the game on Wednesday.\n\nToday all 209 of FIFA's member nations will cast their votes as the world watches.\n\nMichel Platini has confirmed UEFA will vote against Blatter with more and more federations following their lead.\n\nOur man in Zurich, John Cross, will be providing updates as and when the latest breaks while we will be keeping across everything here.\n\nStay tuned for what promises to be a dramatic and potentially historic day.",

                    "body": "WITH FIFA's world crumbling around him, football's Frank Gallagher has a simple message to his critics: 'let's have a PAARTYY!'\n\nSEPP BLATTER finally emerged from his bunker last night to stage a command performance as international football's very own Frank Gallagher.\n\nShameless? It's almost as if the word was made for this Swiss OAP who even had the audacity to invite his adoring cronies to relax, sit back and enjoy the dancers he'd laid on for them for the grand opening of this, FIFA's 65th and crisis-ravaged congress.\n\nThe room responded with a raucous round of applause as the brazen Blatter skipped off stage, one eye glinting and the other darting towards the shallow hemline of the nearest flag-waving showgirl.\n\nRepulsive. There's another word that sprung to mind as Blatter hammed it up for his fawning crowd of flunkies. So grateful are they just to be a part of his Badfellas mob that they have lost the ability to see past their boss, never mind through him.\n\nWhat the rest of the world saw, though, was a shiny-skinned old man with no self-awareness, no remorse and no intention of releasing his grip on our game. As soon as he started speaking one thing became obvious. If we want our ball back, we're going to have to take it off him.\n\n\"There is no hope he will sacrifice himself for the greater good because, in his own mind, he has afforded himself a God-like status.\n\nNever mind Frank Gallagher, what we're dealing with here is a man with a full-blown Messiah complex.\n\n\"You will agree with me,\" he ordered, \"that these are unprecedented and difficult times for FIFA. The events of yesterday have cast a long shadow over football and over the congress.\n\n\"Actions of individuals bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us. We cannot allow the reputation of football and FIFA to be dragged through the mud any longer.\n\n\"I know many hold me responsible for the actions and reputation of the global football community, whether it's a decision for the hosting of the World Cup, or a corruption scandal.\n\n\"We, or I, cannot monitor everyone all the time. If people want to do wrong, they will try to hide it. But it falls to me to bear the responsibility for the reputation of our organisation and to find a way to fix things.\"\n\nAnd with that, Sepp had spoken.\n\nNo self-blame or remorse and no accountability for the crisis which engulfed his empire the moment Swiss law enforcers - acting on behalf of the FBI - raided FIFA's hotel on Wednesday and kick-started this scandal.\n\nBlatter's only role yesterday was that of the ever-so-confused elderly victim. You know, the look that says he's just been turned over by a dodgy gasman. This was him at his grotesque and deluded worst.\n\nIt's not as if he is unaware of the clamour for his removal. In fact, earlier yesterday he spent time alone with UEFA chief Michel Platini who pleaded with him to fall on his sword.\n\nPlatini looked close to tears when he left that meeting, admitting defeat while also apparently threatening to pull all of Europe out of the next two World Cups in Russia and Qatar.\n\nBlatter, on the other hand, didn't appear to be the least bit bothered. And why should he have been? This almighty cluster**** of corruption, bribery and racketeering has nothing to do with him. Nothing whatsoever.\n\nNope, Blatter simply gave the world his best puppy eyes in a way which said: 'Trust me, I feel every bit as cheated as you do.' It was enough to trigger an involuntary gagging reflex.\n\nTimeline of the FIFA corruption scandal: What happened and when\n\nBlatter, now in full flow, said: \"The next few months will not be easy for FIFA. More bad news may follow but it is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organisation.\n\n\"Let this be the turning point. More must be done to make sure everyone in football behaves ethically -\n\neverywhere, also outside of the field of play, where there is no referee, no boundaries, and no time limit. Football - the fans, the players, the clubs, the world deserves so much more.\n\n\"Congress have the chance to begin what will be a long and difficult road to rebuilding trust. We have lost their trust, or at least a big part of it, and we must now earn it back. I will not allow the actions of a few to destroy the hard work and integrity of the majority of those who work so hard for football.\n\n\"I must stress those who are corrupt in football are in a minority, like in society. But like in society they must be caught and held responsible for their actions.\"\n\nAnd there you have it. Please disperse, nothing to see here.\n\nPoll loading ...\n\nAnyway Blatter had other issues on his mind. For one, the collection of leggy young models around his podium. And then there were all those cabaret dancers. Don't forget the dancers Sepp. Astonishingly, he did not.\n\n\"That brings me to tonight's ceremony. You have seen that the opening ceremony is about football, the spirit of the game, the aspect of football that makes it so loved by so many.\n\n\"Our cast of artists and dancers will bring this spirit to life tonight and I thank them all for their hard work in preparing for the show under these special circumstances.\n\n\"I'm sure you will agree they are a great and talented cast. I hope this show will remind us what we are fighting for and\n\nwhy we must continue the fight for positive change in football even when some among us let us down. So please enjoy our show.\"\n\nOr, in other words, 'Let's have a PAARTYY!'\n\nThis was a performance so arrogantly self-indulgent and so lacking in remorse or empathy that it should have made the real\n\nworld cringe.\n\nBut at least Frank Gallagher would have been proud of him.\n\nRevisited ... when Jim Murphy went to Qatar and told the SFA: You've got blood on your hands\n\nTest your knowledge with our sports quiz:",

I want a beautiful FIFA, and strong enough to get out of the storm,\" he added, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nFIFA had acted quickly, banning provisionally 11 individuals from carrying out any soccer-related activities on a national and international level, including those arrested officials.\n\nBut for some pundits, the scandal engulfing FIFA is less about people but more about a system that is difficult to change.\n\nGerman football legend Franz Beckenbauer said: \"It's not the man himself (who is to blame).\"\n\n\"Theo Zwanziger (former president of the German football federation) once said something clever: 'It's not the person but the system'. It's very difficult to change the system,\" said Beckenbauer, who has won the World Cup as a player and a coach.\n\n\"How can you control 209 countries and regions? You're always going to have a few irregularities. We need a new system. I'm not sure which one,\" explained the 69-year-old.\n\nBeckenbauer's opinions were also echoed by Wei Jizhong, former vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee.\n\nWei said: \"Football has been over commercialised. With gambling and manipulation with intermediate agents involved, the game is out of control,\" he said.\n\nFIFA takes in billions of dollars in revenue from television marketing rights and sponsorships, making it one of the wealthiest and most powerful sports bodies in the world. Dogged by corruption scandals for decades, FIFA has usually done self-investigation to avoid scrutiny by criminal courts.\n\n\"The next few months will not be easy for FIFA.

It has to stop here,\" he added.\n\nBlatter called the scandals \"unprecedented\" and said the \"actions of individuals bring shame and humiliation on soccer and demand action and change from us all\".\n\nThe president said FIFA cannot be an \"exception\" to rules on corruption and added \"we will cooperate with all authorities to make sure that anyone involved in wrongdoing - from top to bottom - will be discovered and punished.\"",

But I do know that when you get paid \u00a32million a year to run an organisation it's your job to know what goes on inside it.\n\nBut not according to FIFA boss Sepp Blatter, who said after the arrest of seven top officials accused of an \u00a3100 million bribery and corruption racket, there was no way he could have monitored what everyone was doing.\n\nWell, obviously not the cleaners or the people in the canteen, but he should have known what his top executives were up to - especially as some of them are claimed to have built up multi-million pound property empires on backhanders.\n\nAnd if that passed him by then he shouldn't be re-elected president of his local golf club, let alone a global organisation like FIFA.\n\nMaybe he spent too much time flying around the world on private jets, staying in top hotels and drinking vintage champagne to see what was in front of his face. Which is another reason for him to be booted out.\n\nAs is all that guff he's spouting about how the scandal has brought shame on football and it's his priority now to clean up the game.\n\nTwo things - first, it's not football that's been shamed by this. It's him and his dodgy organisation.\n\nSecond, how long has he been insisting he's going to clean it up?\n\nThe stench of corruption has been clinging to FIFA for years.\n\nAnd for just as many years Blatter has been promising to sort it out and instigating totally ineffective internal investigations which, surprise, surprise, revealed nothing.\n\nAnd so he's done nothing.\n\nFinally, it's been taken out of his hands by the US authorities.\n\nAnd instead of taking responsibility for what's happened on his watch, instead of doing the honourable thing and resigning, this wizened little despot is hanging on to the gravy train like a limpet repeating the mantra he thinks is his Get Out Of Jail Free card: \"I know nothing\".\n\nI'm sorry, but if he missed the fact that officials and executives in FIFA's high command were building themselves palatial mansions - he's an idiot.\n\nAnd did he never question why Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup, a country where footballers will have to play in 50 degree heat?\n\n\"I know many people hold me ultimately responsible for the actions and reputation of the global football community,\" he says.\n\nWell, he's got that right.\n\nBut what's incredible is that Blatter doesn't think what's happened here has anything to do with him and believes he can walk away from it unscathed.\n\nFIFA isn't about sport any more. It's a multi- million pound, international business and it was Blatter's job to run it properly. He failed. So why is he still there?\n\nAnd as he's refused to do the honourable thing, then the sponsors must get him kicked out by withdrawing their support.\n\nAnd football associations all over the world need to say they'll boycott the World Cup if he's in charge.\n\nFIFA is Blatter's little fiefdom and he's been ruling it for too long.\n\n\"We must restore trust in our \u00adorganisation,\" he says.\n\nYes, but that can't happen until the man under whose reign trust has been completely destroyed, has gone.",

Razones por las cuales la investigaci\u00f3n se abre por gesti\u00f3n desleal\", agrega el comunicado.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la fiscal\u00eda indica que \"existen sospechas de blanqueo de dinero a trav\u00e9s de relaciones bancarias en Suiza\".",
