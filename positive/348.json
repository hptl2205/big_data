The airline says Flight 192 carrying 166 people landed safely at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport early Monday, four hours after it departed.  (AP Photo/Vincent Thian)\nAs the search continued off the coast of Australia for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, the airline announced another plane bound for India was forced to make an emergency landing early Monday after one of its tires burst on takeoff.\n All 159 passengers and seven crew members arrived safely back in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, about 2 a.m., about four hours after the plane took off for Bangalore, India.  The incident was more drama for an airline already under immense pressure for answers from the public and the families of those missing from Flight 370, more than six weeks after it departed the same airport.\n ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nDeputy Foreign Affairs Minister Hamzah Zainuddin met with the passengers' relatives in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday to talk about where to go next.  Financial assistance was discussed and family members were urged to submit a plan for consideration.  He declined to elaborate further, but said a fund could possibly be set up by the government or Malaysia Airlines.\n The relatives, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the meeting, saying in a statement that until they have \"at least a tiny bit of concrete evidence\" that the plane crashed, authorities should not try to settle the case with final payoffs.\n \"No meaningful report on the progress of the investigation was given\" at the meeting, the relatives said, adding that \"not a single one\" of their questions was answered.\n \"We realize this is an excruciating time for the families of those on board,\" said Zainuddin, who heads a committee overseeing the needs of the next of kin.  \"No words can describe the pain they must be going through.  We understand the desperate need for information on behalf of the families and those watching around the world.\" \"\nHe added that he would soon visit Beijing to shore up bilateral relations between Malaysia and China.  Two-thirds of the missing plane's 227 passengers were Chinese, and many of their family members have been angered by Malaysia's handling of the investigation, with some accusing the government of lying, incompetence or participating in an outright cover-up.\n After nearly a week of sweeping the bottom of the ocean with sonar, a robotic submarine continued its search on Monday.  The yellow device has already covered about two-thirds of its focused search area, but has yet to uncover any clues that could shed light on the plane's mysterious disappearance.\n The U.S. Navy's Bluefin 21 has made eight trips below the surface to scan the silt-covered seabed far off the coast of western Australia, journeying beyond its recommended depth of 4 1/2 kilometers (2.8 miles).

                    "body": "CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- The hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet will likely soon deploy more powerful sonar equipment that can delve deeper as the current search of the most likely crash site in the Indian Ocean has failed to yield any clues, Australia's defense minister said Wednesday.\n The search coordination center said Wednesday a robotic submarine, the U.S. Navy's Bluefin 21, had so far covered more than 80 percent of the 310-square-kilometer (120-square-mile) seabed search zone off the Australian west coast, creating a three-dimensional sonar map of the ocean floor.  Nothing of interest had been found.\n The 4.5-kilometer (2.8-mile) deep search area is a circle 20 kilometers (12 miles) wide around an area where sonar equipment picked up a signal on April 8 consistent with a plane's black boxes.  The black box beacons' batteries would by now be dead.\n Defense Minister David Johnston said Australia was consulting with Malaysia, China and the United States on the next phase of the search for the plane that went missing March 8, which is likely to be announced next week.\n Johnston said more powerful towed side-scan commercial sonar equipment would probably be deployed, similar to the remote-controlled subs that found RMS Titanic 3,800 meters (12,500 feet) under the Atlantic Ocean in 1985 and the Australian WWII wreck HMAS Sydney in the Indian Ocean off the Australian coast, north of the current search area, in 2008.\n \"The next phase, I think, is that we step up with potentially a more powerful, more capable side-scan sonar to do deeper water,\" Johnston told The Associated Press.\n While the Bluefin had less than one-fifth of the seabed search area to complete, Johnston estimated that task would take another two weeks.\n \"We want to be very thorough,\" he said.\n The Bluefin's first 16-hour sea floor mission last week was aborted because the water depth exceeded its 4.5 kilometer safety limit.  Johnston said it was possible that wreckage had been missed in that deep water.\n The focus of next phase of the seafloor search whether it will include the initial search area would be decided on by continuing analysis of information including flight data and sound detections of suspected beacons, he said.\n \"We are currently gathering all of the facts together to mount a further assault on the most likely location, given all the facts,\" he said.  \"But can I say, it is one hell of a vast area.\" \"\n\"A lot of this seabed has not even been hydrographically surveyed before -- some of it has -- but we're flying blind,\" he said, adding that the seabed in the vicinity of the search was up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep.\n \"The whole thing is extraordinarily complex in one of other most isolated parts of the ocean on the planet in very deep water,\" he added.\n The air search for debris would likely continue until a new search phase was announced next week, he said.\n The search center said up to 10 planes and 12 ships would join Wednesday's search of an expanse covering 38,000 square kilometers (14,500 square miles), centered 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) northwest of the city of Perth.\n Radar and satellite data show the jet carrying 239 passengers and crew veered far off course on March 8 for unknown reasons during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.

They have been recalled.\n Current weather conditions are resulting in heavy seas and poor visibility and are making air search activities ineffective and potentially hazardous, the centre says in a statement.\n The 12 ships involved in todays search will continue with their planned activities, it says.  The search area is 1,600 kilometres northwest of Perth.\n More powerful sonar equipment\nThe suspension comes after Australia's defense minister said today the hunt for the missing flight MH370 will likely soon deploy more powerful sonar equipment that can delve deeper as the current search of the most likely crash site in the Indian Ocean has failed to yield any clues.\n The search coordination centre said today a robotic submarine, the US Navy's Bluefin 21, had so far covered more than 80% of the 310-square-kilometre seabed search zone off the Australian west coast, creating a three-dimensional sonar map of the ocean floor.  Nothing of interest had been found.\n The 4.5-kilometre deep search area is a circle 20 kilometres wide around an area where sonar equipment picked up a signal on April 8 consistent with a plane's black boxes.  The black box beacons' batteries would by now be dead.\n Defense Minister David Johnston said Australia was consulting with Malaysia, China and the United States on the next phase of the search for the plane that went missing March 8, which is likely to be announced next week.\n Johnston said more powerful towed side-scan commercial sonar equipment would probably be deployed, similar to the remote-controlled subs that found RMS Titanic 3,800 metres under the Atlantic Ocean in 1985 and the Australian WWII wreck HMAS Sydney in the Indian Ocean off the Australian coast, north of the current search area, in 2008.\n \"The next phase, I think, is that we step up with potentially a more powerful, more capable side-scan sonar to do deeper water,\" Johnston told The Associated Press.\n While the Bluefin had less than one-fifth of the seabed search area to complete, Johnston estimated that task would take another two weeks.\n \"We want to be very thorough,\" he said.\n Radar and satellite data show the jet carrying 239 passengers and crew veered far off course on March 8 for unknown reasons during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.  Analysis indicates it would have run out of fuel in the remote section of ocean where the search has been focused.

The unmanned sub has spent nearly a week searching for the plane's data recorders and covered about two-thirds of its focused search area, but it has yet to find any clues that could shed light on the case.\n The US Navy's Bluefin 21 has made eight trips below the surface to scan the seabed far off the coast of western Australia, journeying beyond its recommended depth of 4.5km.  Its search area forms a 10km radius around the location of an underwater signal that was believed to have come from the recorders.\n The Joint Agency Coordination Center organizing the search said the sonar scan of the seafloor in the area was expected to be completed sometime this week.\n Malaysian Minister of Defense Hishammuddin Hussein stressed the importance of the submarine missions, but said that if no debris is recovered, the search's scope may be broadened or other assets used.\n The search for debris on the ocean surface also continued yesterday, with up to 10 military aircraft and 11 ships combing a 49,500km2 area, about 1,700km northwest of Perth, the center said.\n The intense global scrutiny the flight's disappearance has brought upon Malaysia's government has tossed a wild card into its controversial efforts to send opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim back to jail.\n Hours before the plane vanished on March 8, a court overturned Anwar's 2012 acquittal on sodomy charges he says are false and part of a government bid to ruin him.\n Sentenced to five years in jail, but free on appeal, Anwar would be expelled from parliament if the conviction holds, dealing a severe blow for a fractious opposition that has enjoyed unprecedented success by uniting around his star power.\n However, Anwar said the negative attention over MH370 may force the government to think twice.\n \"[MH370] certainly will have a bearing,\" Anwar, 66, said when asked whether concern over international reaction to his jailing could make his political foes pause.  \"The entire radar is on Malaysia -- that it is opaque, semi-authoritarian, [has] no transparency, no accountability.\" \"\nUnaccustomed to answering for itself at home, Kuala Lumpur has faced a barrage of international criticism for the unexplained loss of the plane with 239 people aboard.\n Malaysia's opposition says the saga has exposed institutional decay and incompetence in a government dominated since 1957 by the ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO), which is widely accused of cronyism and corruption.\n A former Malaysian deputy prime minister with UMNO, Anwar has cultivated strong friendships in Washington and the US Department of State has questioned the March 7 ruling against him.",

Instamos a todo el mundo a rezar para que encontremos algo\", declar\u00f3 Hussein en rueda de prensa.\n El primer ministro australiano, Tony Abbott, hab\u00eda dicho el mi\u00e9rcoles que el rastreo del fondo marino situado a 2 mil kil\u00f3metros al noroeste de la ciudad australiana de Perth con la ayuda del minisubmarino no tripulado Bluefin-21 s\u00f3lo durar\u00eda una semana.\n Seg\u00fan los expertos y sobre la base de las mediciones de radar, el vuelo MH370, que realizaba un vuelo entre Kuala Lumpur y Pek\u00edn el pasado 8 de marzo, se precipit\u00f3 al agua al sur del Oc\u00e9ano Indico.\n El Boeing 777 pudo haberse estrellado en el Indico Sur, el \u00e1rea mar\u00edtima denominada como el \"desierto del mar\".  Eso es lo m\u00e1s probable para los entendidos, pero genera extra\u00f1eza que no se hayan encontrado restos, aun con los numerosos objetos a bordo de la nave capaces de flotar.\n Las emisiones emitidas por las bater\u00edas de las cajas negras no han permitido ning\u00fan avance en la misi\u00f3n tit\u00e1nica de la Marina de Estados Unidos con el rastreador Bluefin-21.  El submarino ya investig\u00f3 una zona de 133 kil\u00f3metros cuadrados, sin hallar ning\u00fan \"contacto de inter\u00e9s\", anunci\u00f3 el Centro de Coordinaci\u00f3n de Agencias Conjuntas.\n El submarino no tripulado que escane\u00f3 el lecho del Indico en busca del avi\u00f3n desaparecido descendi\u00f3 a niveles r\u00e9cord de profundidad, poniendo en un riesgo sin precedentes a su equipo de rastreo.  De nada sirvi\u00f3.\n El Bluefin-21 lleg\u00f3 ayer a una profundidad de 4.695 metros.  \"Es la primera vez que el aparato desciende a esta profundidad\", dijo un vocero de la Marina de Estados Unidos.",
