It's a plan for the intervention of foreign forces in the country,\" Maduro stated.\n Martinelli has denied the claim, stating his government called on the OAS to promote political dialogue, ensure human rights and democracy.  He described Maduro's comments as \"unacceptable insults\".\n \"The foul language used is inappropriate for the president of a brother country,\" Martinelli said in a statement issued last night.\n \"Panama only longs for its brother country to find peace and strengthen its democracy,\" he stated.\n Along with severing diplomatic ties, Maduro also stated he would \"freeze all economic...relations\".\n The decision sparked fears that repayments of Venezuelan debt in the Colon Free Zone (CFZ) will be indefinitely frozen.\n Venezuelan companies could have around US$2 billion in debt in the CFZ, according to the free port's manager, Leopoldo Benedetti.\n \"The debt was incurred mainly because Venezuelan businesspeople lack liquidity due to a US dollar shortage in their country,\" Benedetti stated, according to El Universal.\n Last year Venezuela and Panama established a bilateral commission to resolve concerns over CFZ debt.\n Wednesday's decision follows calls from Washington for action against Maduro's government.  On Tuesday, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for international support of Venezuela's political opposition.\n Maduro has long maintained that the US is providing funding and other support to the opposition.  On Wednesday, he also accused Martinelli of being a US \"lackey\".\n However, Venezuela's largest opposition coalition, the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) has condemned the freezing of relations with Panama.  In a statement, the MUD described the decision as \"aggressive rhetoric\".\n \"The international relations of one country cannot be handled at the whim of its rulers,\" the MUD stated.\n The OAS is expected to hold talks on Venezuela in the US today.  The talks are closed to the public.\n OAS President Jose Miguel Insulza has suggested sending international observers to Venezuela if both the government and opposition consent.  However, during a speech on Wednesday, Insulza indicated that beyond calls for peace, further OAS actions are unlikely.",

Enough!\" thundered Maduro, who regards the protests as a US-backed plot to destabilize his government.\n Pinera, who has enjoyed cordial relations with Caracas despite his ideological differences with Maduro, has called for respect for human rights in Venezuela.\n His successor, leftist Michelle Bachelet, on Thursday pledged her support for \"the government and people of Venezuela\" as they seek a democratic, peaceful way out of the crisis, which erupted on February 4 and has become the biggest challenge yet to Maduro's nearly year-old government.\n Colombia's Santos has called for calm and dialogue with Venezuela, though Caracas has accused former president Alvaro Uribe of fueling the anti-government opposition.\n She said Chile would support respect for human rights, but also would oppose \"violent actions seeking to destabilize a democratically elected government.\" \"\n- Silence from Brazil -\nRegional giant Brazil, whose traditional line is not to interfere in the internal affairs of neighbors, has so far only reiterated the line of tacit support for Maduro issued by Mercosur, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela.\n Brazil \"will, as far as it can, resist criticizing the situation, unless and until an escalation of the violence makes that impossible,\" says Pfeifer.\n Mexico issued a statement condemning violence \"but without fingering those responsible\" so it could avoid \"an unnecessary dynamic of conflict with Venezuela,\" Mexican political analyst Alfonso Zarate told AFP.\n The strongest statement of discontent in the region has come from a group of former Latin American presidents who condemned \"disproportionate repression\" of the protests by Venezuelan authorities.\n Former leaders Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Ricardo Lagos of Chile, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Alejandro Toledo of Peru also demanded an \"immediate halt to persecution of students and opposition leaders\" and the freeing of those jailed for political reasons.\n - Talks without Washington -\nVenezuela last week dispatched Foreign Minister Elias Jaua on a regional tour to whip up support and call an extraordinary meeting of Unasur, rather than have to endure OAS talks that would include the United States, largely viewed with scorn in the region in recent years.\n US Secretary of State John Kerry nevertheless has said he was working with Colombia and other countries to see if mediation was possible.",

The demonstration movement is angry at President Nicolas Maduro's government over inflation and the lack of basic products in the country such as paper, sugar and oil.\n The latest outbreak of deadly violence happened on Friday when an unidentified gunman opened fire on a group of people dismantling a barricade in the East of the Venezuelan capital city.  The shooting spree left a riot officer and a motorcyclist dead.  Later in the day clashes between student protesters and riot police were reported in the Altamira.  Police deployed tear gas to disperse the students who threw stones and Molotov cocktails at them.\n President Nicolas Maduro has denounced the violence as the product of a fascist political minority.\n \"The majority of the opposition are peaceful,\" President Maduro told CNN in an interview, adding that the Venezuelan government has always respected freedom of expression.  On a number of occasions Maduro has pointed the finger at the US for inciting and plotting to overthrow the Venezuelan government in a coup d'etat.\n Earlier this week, Maduro ejected the Panamanian ambassador along with three other diplomats from Venezuela, citing their alleged involvement in a conspiracy against his government.  He took issue with a petition made by the Panamanian government to the Washington-based Organization of American States for a private meeting regarding the continuing unrest in Venezuela.\n Washington, for its part, has urged Venezuela to investigate reports of widespread police brutality during the protests and denied orchestrating the unrest.\n Venezuela's South American neighbors have for the most part offered their support to President Maduro.  Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa said earlier this week in a television interview that Maduro's government was not repressing its people.\n \"The truth is that the Venezuelan government is the victim, Nicolas Maduro is a humane person who would be incapable of repressing his own people,\" Correa said.\n Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner also voiced her solidarity, denouncing the violence in Caracas as an attempt at a coup d'\u00e9tat.",

                    "body": "It's a shame that Venezuela just severed diplomatic and economic ties with Panama, because their respective presidents - Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and Ricardo Martinelli - have a lot in common.\n Yes, I know that Maduro is a radical socialist and former bus driver.  And that Martinelli is a right-wing supermarket tycoon.\n But they're both intolerant ideologues who believe, among other retro-anti-democratic notions, that folks should be thrown in the pokey for saying or writing anything that insults leaders like them.  (Venezuela's legislature has actually codified that thinking; Panama's fortunately has rebuffed Martinelli's attempts to do the same.) )\nNevertheless, they are serious hemispheric adversaries who like to call each other \"lackeys\" of either the United States or Cuba.  So the diplomatic divorce that Maduro announced Wednesday - in peevish response to Martinelli's call for the Organization of American States (OAS) to get involved in Venezuela's anti-government protests crisis - isn't all that surprising.\n Nor is the chilling effect that it's likely to have on the OAS this week as it convenes in Washington, D.C., to discuss what - if anything - to do about the bitter clash between Maduro and his opposition, which has killed at least 18 people.  Most analysts, including Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, don't expect much to come of the OAS meeting.\n \"I think it's very unlikely that [it's] going to produce any meaningful results,\" Shifter told me.  \"There's not much support among many [member] countries to confront Maduro.  They're nervous about him [because] he's so unpredictable, and his breaking relations with Panama will only aggravate that.\" \"\nRELATED: What My Talks With Hugo Taught Me About Chavismo In Venezuela\nShifter cites others reasons - including a fear among many smaller Latin American and Caribbean countries of being cut off from Venezuela's oil largesse, or anxiety among most governments in the region about alienating leftist voters.\n But even if Maduro's opponents have little hope of ousting him - he still has the support of about half the country, especially among his base of poorer voters - the angry street demonstrations that began early last month show little sign of ending.\n And the longer they last, the more Maduro's security forces and neighborhood watch organizations - already widely condemned for their heavy-handed response to the unrest - risk further sullying his international image.\n Which means at some point sooner than later, some outside entity needs to prod Maduro and his foes - who for their part need to more sharply define the aim of these protests - to a negotiating table to hash out what sparked the student-led outburst in the first place: Venezuela's deep economic and social crises - which have saddled the hemisphere's most oil-rich nation with South America's highest inflation and murder rates - and the authoritarian left-wing agenda the protesters accuse Maduro's government of ramming down the country's throat.\n If not the OAS - which Maduro distrusts anyway as yet another puppet of the Americans, who he insists is behind the protests to begin with - then who?  Maduro suggests the South America regional body known as Unasur - but the Venezuelan opposition distrusts it as a puppet of the regional left.\n Perhaps neighboring Colombia, but it's already locked in peace talks with Marxist guerrillas and has a presidential election coming up in May.  Or neighboring Brazil, but it's racing to finish soccer World Cup preparations for this summer, and President Dilma Rousseff's got anti-government street protests of her own to deal with.\n Shifter thinks the Vatican may be the best bet, given Pope Francis' Latin American bona fides and his appeal to both Maduro and opposition forces.\n \"I think the Pope would have that credibility,\" Shifter said.  \"He could play that role.\" \"\nNERVE-WRACKING TASK\nWhoever emerges to play it, the task of mediating in a country as fiercely polarized as Venezuela is likely to be as nerve-wracking as a late-night walk through Caracas' violent crime-plagued streets - or as frustrating as finding cooking oil or toilet paper on many of its grocery store shelves.\n Then again, Maduro showed signs of some mature flexibility on Thursday when he reportedly sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Christiane Amanpour of CNN - the same yanqui network he's accused for weeks of whipping up the unrest, and which he's threatened to chuck out of Venezuela.\n In that regard, observers like Shifter are right: Maduro can be remarkably unpredictable.  But ever since he was elected President last year - to succeed his mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died a year ago this week - that erratic nature has usually worked against Venezuela.  If the CNN interview is the start of a trend, maybe Maduro's character could finally work in the country's favor.",

Enough!\" thundered Maduro, who regards the protests as a U.S.-backed plot to destabilize his government.\n Pinera, who has enjoyed cordial relations with Caracas despite his ideological differences with Maduro, has called for respect for human rights in Venezuela.\n His successor, leftist Michelle Bachelet, on Thursday pledged her support for \"the government and people of Venezuela\" as they seek a democratic, peaceful way out of the crisis, which erupted on February 4 and has become the biggest challenge yet to Maduro's nearly year-old government.\n Colombia's Santos has called for calm and dialogue with Venezuela, though Caracas has accused former president Alvaro Uribe of fueling the anti-government opposition.\n She said Chile would support respect for human rights, but also would oppose \"violent actions seeking to destabilize a democratically elected government.\" \"\nRegional giant Brazil, whose traditional line is not to interfere in the internal affairs of neighbors, has so far only reiterated the line of tacit support for Maduro issued by Mercosur, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela.\n Brazil \"will, as far as it can, resist criticizing the situation, unless and until an escalation of the violence makes that impossible,\" says Pfeifer.\n Mexico issued a statement condemning violence \"but without fingering those responsible\" so it could avoid \"an unnecessary dynamic of conflict with Venezuela,\" Mexican political analyst Alfonso Zarate told AFP.\n The strongest statement of discontent in the region has come from a group of former Latin American presidents who condemned \"disproportionate repression\" of the protests by Venezuelan authorities.\n Former leaders Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Ricardo Lagos of Chile, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Alejandro Toledo of Peru also demanded an \"immediate halt to persecution of students and opposition leaders\" and the freeing of those jailed for political reasons.\n Venezuela last week dispatched Foreign Minister Elias Jaua on a regional tour to whip up support and call an extraordinary meeting of Unasur, rather than have to endure OAS talks that would include the United States, largely viewed with scorn in the region in recent years.\n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry nevertheless has said he was working with Colombia and other countries to see if mediation was possible.",

The meeting, which was scheduled to continue on Friday, was requested by Panama as businesses in the country reportedly expressed concerns about $2 billion in debt owed to them by the Venezuelan government.\n Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro reacted angrily to Panama's request by breaking off diplomatic and economic ties to the country, expelling the Panamanian ambassador and three other diplomats, and attributing the OAS meeting to \"moves by the United States government in accord with a lackey government of a right-wing president.\" \"\n\"OAS, out of here!  For now and forever!\" Maduro said in a fiery speech this week.\n Maduro's government has been widely condemned for an almost month-long crackdown on protesters that has now resulted in 20 deaths.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R., Fla.) denounced what she called the silence of the OAS and its members in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon.\n \"This organization, which was founded to defend liberty and democracy, is absent when democracy is actually under threat,\" she said.  \"To add insult to injury, it is holding its deliberations where it will treat the Maduro regime with kid gloves under a cloud of secrecy.\" \"\n\"The session should be open and transparent, like the freedom they purport to promote,\" she added.  \"History will remember the names of those who stayed silent in the face of oppression, especially this shameful lot who claimed to be the defenders of liberty.\" \"\nRos-Lehtinen circulated a letter among lawmakers this week that calls on President Barack Obama to impose targeted sanctions against Venezuelan officials involved in human rights abuses, including U.S. visa bans, asset freezes, and prohibitions on financial transactions.\n Rep.  Matt Salmon (R., Ariz.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, previously urged the OAS to demand an independent investigation into alleged human rights violations in a statement to the Free Beacon.\n U.S. Ambassador to the OAS Carmen Lomellin said in prepared remarks that the U.S. government was \"severely disturbed\" by Venezuela's restrictions on freedom of expression and the press.  She also expressed support for a third-party mediator to assist \"genuine dialogue\" in the country.  However, that prospect appeared unlikely with Maduro's refusal to work with the OAS.\n Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced on Thursday that members of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), viewed as a pro-Venezuela alternative to the OAS, would meet next week to discuss the unrest in the country.\n \"The truth is that the Venezuelan government is the victim, Nicolas Maduro is a humane person who would be incapable of repressing his own people,\" Correa said during a televised interview.\n Correa himself has been sharply criticized by human rights activists for his administration's harassment of dissenters and threats to fine and jail critical journalists.\n Maduro and former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez have long used their countries' immense oil and gas reserves to expand the influence of its socialist ALBA bloc, which includes authoritarian governments in Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, and Nicaragua.  Declines in overall production and exports have posed new economic challenges to Venezuela in recent years.\n Protesters blame the Maduro administration's strict currency controls and overall economic mismanagement for rampant inflation and shortages of basic goods.

Instead, they have led to regional stalemate and antagonism.\n The Panamanian government called for the Organization of American States (OAS) to bring all the region's foreign ministers together on Thursday (Mar 6) to find a solution to the violence generated by the anti-government protests which have rocked Venezuela since February 12, leaving around 20 dead and hundreds wounded and arrested.\n However, due to the influence of Venezuela's vocal allies in Latin America - particularly Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua and Argentina - and the silence of many other countries on the matter, the OAS was unable to muster sufficient participation from Latin America's governments.\n The organization is now scheduled to discuss a joint resolution calling for dialog in Venezuela, however the viability of a declaration of this kind remains doubtful, as does the probability of definitive action, as Venezuela remains highly opposed to any influence from the OAS, with President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claiming its motives are \"interventionist.\" \"\nHuman Rights Watch's director for the Americas, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, has previously criticized what he called the region's \"silence\" in the face of the crisis and the violations of human rights occurring in Venezuela, including press censorship, the intimidation and arrest of journalists, the arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and reports of brutality against those detained.\n Vivanco has particularly lamented Brazil's reluctance to speak out, while praising Chile's Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era and Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos for issuing statements deploring the political violence in the country.\n BREAKING TIES WITH PANAMA\nIn response to Panama's request for further OAS action on the crisis, Maduro announced that Venezuela had decided to break diplomatic and political ties with Panama.  During the commemoration of the anniversary of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's death, he accused Panama of attempting to organize foreign intervention in its internal affairs.\n In a clear effort to intimidate his other neighbors, Maduro also warned the OAS not to interfere further, saying at the same ceremony that he will react with \"force\" against any country that does so.\n At the same time, the rest of Latin America appears to prefer silence regarding Venezuela's decision on Panama, with a notable lack of public criticism or questioning of the move.",

Barely hours later, the president also announced that Venezuela was cutting off relations with Panama, since it was President Ricardo Martinelli's administration that made the request for mediation to OAS.  \"We have said loud and clear through diplomatic means the opinion of the revolutionary government of Venezuela,\" Maduro said.\n \"There are maneuvers by the U.S. government plotting with a lackey government that has a right-wing president who is leaving in the next few months, who is not worthy of his people, who has been working actively against Venezuela,\" he added.\n This show of defiance happened in front of several international leaders who were attending the Ch\u00e1vez's memorial, like Cuba's Ra\u00fal Castro, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega -- allies of the Bolivarian revolution.  \"We are a peaceful people, but we are also brave in what matters, like defending our rights,\" Maduro added in his speech.\n The OAS Permanent Council, however, planned to still hold a scheduled meeting Thursday to talk about the crisis in Venezuela, per Panama's request and amid demands from U.S. South Florida lawmakers for action against the regime.  \"We pay a lot of attention to situations like [Venezuelan crisis] when they happen further away, and this is something that's happening with one of our immediate neighbors,\" said Sen.  Bill Nelson, D-Fla., , on Wednesday in support of the OAS meeting.\n Panama's government denied Maduro's accusations.  \"We reject as unacceptable the insults uttered by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro against our country and its highest authority.  The foul language used is inappropriate for the president of a brother country,\" read the statement issued by Panama City.\n In the meantime, Martinelli took to Twitter to make his personal feelings known.  \"Panama only longs for its brother country to find peace and strengthen its democracy,\" he said.\n Indeed, no matter what Maduro says, Venezuela looks anything but peaceful these days.  Disregarding the demand of the government to not disrupt the Ch\u00e1vez death anniversary \"in order to respect the feelings of half of the country,\" opposition groups built barricades all around the country on Tuesday.  In Caracas, their goal was to obstruct the way for officials and international leaders around the city -- especially Castro's, considered by most a mentor to the Venezuelan regime.  However, the handful of international invitees, which also included representatives from Argentina and Brazil, made it to the parade without many problems.\n Patricia Rey Mall\u00e9n Twitter Google Plus RSS\nPatricia covers Latin America for the International Business Times.\n Before joining IBT in March 2013, she worked at BBC America in New York, La Rep\u00fablica in Lima...

Its nearly $100 billion in annual oil exports rank it among the world's top 10 oil exporters - Dr. Douglas Cassel, Professor of Law at Norte Dame Law School about Venezuela.\n However, the country is gripped by poverty and protests as it also leads in price inflation.  Its official inflation rate of 56 percent annually is the highest in the world.  More realistically, after factoring in the black market, economist Steve Hanke of John Hopkins University and the Cato Institute has calculated Venezuela's real rate of inflation at more than 300 percent, Dr. Cassel says.\n Though President Maduro has imposed price controls on some basic goods, it made things worse resulting in severe shortages of vital necessities like corn, flour, butter, eggs, and even toilet paper.  So, Venezuela is forced to import about two-thirds of its food (wheat from the United States, chickens from Brazil), as well as many consumer goods.  And since Maduro took power in March 2013, the value of the national currency has sunk by nearly two-thirds against the dollar.\n So no wonder that tens of thousands of Venezuelan university students have taken to the streets in protest.  They are supported by anti-Maduro opposition in most of the largest cities.  The regime a;ready had opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez arrested and charged with murder.  L\u00f3pez remains behind bars, awaiting trial.\n Maduro's regime, however, responds not by reforms but by labeling domestic human-rights groups as traitors and accusing its neighbors of plotting the attacks.\n Among those \"traitors\" appeared Panama - Venezuela's President severed diplomatic relations with the country Wednesday, accusing the Central American nation of being a \"lackey\" for the United States in a conspiracy plot against his government, CNN reports.  He accused Panama of pushing for regional organizations to intervene in Venezuela.  As a result, Maduro said he was cutting off diplomatic and political ties and freezing trade relations with Panama's current government \"in defense of the homeland's sovereignty.\" \"\n\"There are maneuvers by the US government plotting with a lackey government that has a right-wing president who is leaving in the next few months, who is not worthy of his people, who has been working actively against Venezuela,\" President Nicolas Maduro said in televised remarks.\n Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli wrote on Twitter that he was surprised by Venezuela's decision.\n \"Panama only longs for its brother country to find peace and strengthen its democracy,\" he said.\n In a statement late Wednesday, Panama's government denied Maduro's accusations and said it had tried to encourage action by the Organization of American States to help promote dialogue, democracy and human rights in Venezuela.\n \"We reject as unacceptable the insults uttered by President Nicolas Maduro against our country and its highest authority.  The foul language used is inappropriate for the president of a brother country,\" the statement said.\n Last month Maduro expelled three US diplomats form Venezuela, accusing them of conspiring against his government.\n The United States expelled three Venezuelan diplomats last week in retaliation.\n The State Department has repeatedly denied Venezuela's accusations that it's funding opposition efforts to topple Maduro's government or involved in other conspiracy plots, CNN writes.\n \"Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,\" US President Barack Obama told reporters last month.",

Meanwhile, Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa announced that foreign ministers from the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) will meet in Chile on March 11 to discuss Venezuela's crisis.

The March 5 decision came shortly after the release of a University of Costa Rica poll showing that Araya trailed his contender Luis Guillermo Sol\u00eds by over 40 points.  Araya is the first candidate in the country's history to discontinue his campaign before a second-round vote.  But because Costa Rica's Constitution does not allow a candidate to withdraw from a runoff, Araya's name will still show up on the ballot.\n Read an AS/COA Online blog post about Araya's decision.\n Mexico's Senate Considers Reforms to Military Justice Law\nThis week, Mexico's Senate debated reforms to the country's Military Justice Code, which would allows civil courts to judge members of the armed forces for crimes against civilians that took place during peacetime.  The proposal would also allow victims of military abuse to gain access \"to truth and justice\" and not just reparations.  Under the reform, military courts would have jurisdiction only when crimes adversely affect the interests of the armed forces.\n Fewer Mexicans Have U.S.-Based Family Members\nA new Mitofsky survey found that the percentage of Mexicans with family living in the United States stands at 32.4 percent as of June 2013 -- the same rate as in a prior survey in September 2012.

Learn more about this vote and its impact on the presidential race.\n Corruption Control: Colombia's New Transparency Law\nPresident Juan Manuel Santos signed a new transparency and information access bill into law on March 6, calling it \"truly revolutionary\" in the fight against corruption.  He added that information is a right, not a privilege, and that it is the government's obligation to provide it to the public.  The law -- which comes into force in six months -- will not only require public organizations and officials to provide information upon request, but also government contractors and political parties.\n Brazil's Farm Lobby Seeks to Soften Forest Law\nThis week, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo reported that Brazil's farm lobby and representatives from the country's Agriculture Ministry asked the executive branch to make changes to how the country's forest law is implemented.  The controversial reform to this legislation passed in 2012, though certain points have yet to be put into practice.  The farm lobby wants the federal government to replace fines given for deforestation with warnings -- instead of replanting trees.  The group also would like to change property registration rules, which would allow large landowners to gain benefits given to small farmers.\n In 2014, Brazil Sees Record Trade Deficit\nThis week, the Brazilian government released figures showing a $2.13 billion trade deficit in February -- the largest trade deficit for that month since 1994.  In January, Brazil had a record $4.06 billion deficit, its largest monthly trade gap ever.  Lower prices of oil exports and high levels of energy imports are the source of the deficit, Brazil Trade Association President Jos\u00e9 Augusto de Castro told O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo.\n Ahead of Bachelet Inauguration, Chile Gets Its First Female Senate President\nFor the first time in its history, Chile's upper house of Congress will be headed by a woman.  Isabel Allende -- currently a senator for the Atacama region and daughter of the country's former President Salvador Allende -- was appointed on Thursday to lead the Senate, a post her father also held.\n In addition to her new role, Allende will also place the presidential sash on President-elect Michelle Bachelet when she is inaugurated for the second time March 11.  Leaders from around the region will attend the ceremony, including the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, as well as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n Peru and Chile Come to Agreement on Maritime Border Starting Point\nOn March 2, Chile and Peru concluded talks on the starting point for their shared maritime border, reports El Comercio.  Experts from both countries worked throughout the weekend to reach an agreement.  The talks initially began on February 6, after the International Court of Justice ruled that both countries would need to jointly establish a point of origin for their border.\n Report: Money Laundering Hot Spots in the Americas\nA new U.S. State Department report released this week lists a number of Western Hemisphere countries whose financial institutions' transactions include large proceeds from international drug trafficking.  The 2014 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report named Canada and the United States, eight Caribbean countries, and 12 other Latin American countries as major money laundering hot spots.\n Ranking: Caracas Rated as LatAm's Most Expensive City\nCaracas is the world's sixth most expensive city, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) data.  The Venezuelan capital was the only Latin American city to place in the top 10 of the EIU's bi-annual Worldwide Cost of Living survey, which ranks 131 cities on factors such as currency appreciation and price inflation.  However, Venezuelan journalist Francisco Toro writes for the New Republic that Caracas' ranking has to do with Venezuela's \"dysfunctional currency exchange control system.\" \" He explains: \"At the more realistic black market rate, as EIU itself notes, Caracas is one the cheapest big cities on earth.\" \"\nAt spot 124, Panama City is the least expensive Latin American city in the survey.  Meanwhile, Brazilian cities S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro fell in the ranks from 43 to 57 and from 61 to 77, respectively.",

                    "body": "Misunderstanding over Non-Intervention Impedes Democracy in Latin America\nEspa\u00f1olThe first 14 years of this century have featured, like never before, the governments of the Americas trampling on the sacred right to democracy and forgoing and defense of representative democracy -- both guaranteed with great fanfare in the Inter-American Democratic Charter of 2001.\n I refer to the shameful inaction of most American states, the Organization of American States (OAS), and multiple integration and multilateral agencies that currently exist in the hemisphere regarding the current situation of democratic decay in Venezuela.  The same goes for the frequent constitutional and human rights violations in Latin-American countries, particularly within members of the Bolivarian Alliance (ALBA).\n No doubt this is due in large part to the numerous leftist, populist, pro-Cuban-revolution governments that have come to power over the years -- starting with the Ch\u00e1vez-Maduro government of Venezuela.  These governments try to torpedo representative and liberal democracy, and subsequently, to install and promote what they call \"popular, revolutionary, Bolivarian democracy.\" \" In practice is no more than an authoritarian political system with a thin democratic facade .\n The lack of a strong defense of representative democracy in the continent also stems from the OAS, the governing body of the American system since its creation in 1948.  The case of the current Venezuelan crisis, to cite just one example, shows how the OAS remains an inept and limited organization, which in practice behaves more reactively than proactively.\n As pointed out by analyst Rub\u00e9n Perina, there are several inherent limitations and tensions in this organization, which mainly correspond to the limitations that have traditionally been identified for all international organizations and international law in general.  These include the limitations of the \"non-mandatory sanctions,\" due to the fact that the decisions of its governing bodies (General Assembly, Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Permanent Council) only have the character of recommendations, suggestions, or exhortations to member states to comply with the agreed resolutions.\n In addition, the OAS doesn't have the jurisdiction or enforcement capacity to implement on its own the decisions of the governing bodies, or to force their application in order to enforce the agreed measures, as the OAS Charter doesn't allow the use of force or coercive measures.\n But there is a deeper reason for the abuse or mere indifference to the principle of defense of representative democracy in the Americas, be it implemented unilaterally by a state, or collectively by a regional body.  This important legal and political obstacle is the principle of non-intervention, i.e., the right of every sovereign independent state to handle its own internal affairs free from intervention by any other state, a principle enshrined in both national law and classic and modern international law.\n Indeed, despite the historical evolution of the concept of non-intervention -- as well as of those of sovereignty and self-determination -- it has been and is a powerful barrier to the implementation of international policies toward the defense and promotion of democracy.\n In its formal sense, the defense and promotion of democracy by a state or international actor towards others does not mean, and should not mean, an act of interference in the internal affairs of other nations, or violations of their sovereignty, autonomy, and independence -- legal and political.  In fact, the OAS itself states as one of its main purposes, to promote and consolidate representative democracy within a framework of respect for the principle of nonintervention.\n However, the defense and promotion of democracy has been limited in practice by the principle of non-intervention, and by virtue of the fear and doubt that have always existed among governments -- including the most democratic -- on the impact and supremacy that democratic principles can have on the principle of non-intervention, which could eventually provide an open door for interventionism.\n Yet aware that it is in collective action where the antidote for unilateral intervention lies, Latin American countries -- particularly those governed by radical Marxists -- still fear that collective action taken on behalf of the defense and promotion of democracy, could lead to the intervention of a state in the internal affairs of another state, especially to cover up the will and interests of the regional power, the United States.\n The problem is that this absolute and even biased interpretation of the principle of non-intervention, coupled with the excessive precautions towards pro-democracy policies, have served to protect and perpetuate, in many opportunities, Latin-American dictatorships and pseudo-dictatorships, such as the one that today exists in Venezuela.\n If the majority of the governments in the continent do not enforce the normative principle of the defense of representative democracy, the OAS will finally wither away, and organizations like CELAC and UNASUR -- as Cuba, Venezuela, and the albistas hope -- will go on to dominate hemispheric policy, and thereby legitimize the new socialist dictatorships of the 21st century.",

El presidente de Venezuela, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, pidi\u00f3 hoy a su hom\u00f3logo estadounidense, Barack Obama, que respete su pa\u00eds y la regi\u00f3n para no ir a un \"callej\u00f3n sin salida\" en Venezuela y en el conjunto de Am\u00e9rica Latina, al tiempo que le invit\u00f3 a establecer \"nuevos niveles de relaci\u00f3n\".\n \"Qu\u00e9 har\u00eda Estados Unidos, qu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda en Estados Unidos si alg\u00fan grupo dijera que va a incendiar los Estados Unidos para que Obama se vaya, para que renuncie, para cambiar el Gobierno constitucional de Estados Unidos.  Seguramente el Estado reaccionar\u00eda, utilizar\u00eda toda la fuerza que le da la ley para restablecer el orden\", dijo Maduro a la CNN.\n En un momento de fuertes protestas contra su Gobierno en Venezuela y de tensi\u00f3n con Washington por la reacci\u00f3n de su Ejecutivo, Maduro concedi\u00f3 una entrevista a la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense CNN, una conversaci\u00f3n de la que el jueves se publicaron dos extractos y que se emitir\u00e1 \u00edntegra este viernes a las 19:00 horas (GMT) por el canal internacional de la cadena.\n Preguntado por la conocida periodista Christiane Amanpour sobre los violentos disturbios que vive su pa\u00eds desde hace casi un mes, Maduro insisti\u00f3 en que quienes se manifiestan en su contra son una \"minor\u00eda\".\n \"Deben saber en los Estados Unidos y quienes nos escuchan en este prestigioso programa, que los que han adelantado este plan violento son una minor\u00eda, un grupo, bueno, perteneciente a la oposici\u00f3n, que ha puesto en aprietos al resto de la dirigencia pol\u00edtica de la oposici\u00f3n\", sostuvo Maduro en el extracto adelantado por CNN en espa\u00f1ol.\n La cadena emitir\u00e1 la entrevista en espa\u00f1ol a las 3.30 am horas GMT del s\u00e1bado en el marco de un programa especial sobre las protestas que vive el pa\u00eds suramericano.\n \"Mi mensaje -a los Estados Unidos- es respeto, di\u00e1logo, superaci\u00f3n de las visiones que ha habido de nuestro pa\u00eds.  Precisamente yo tom\u00e9 la decisi\u00f3n de nombrar un nuevo embajador en Estados Unidos.  (...) No vayamos a un callej\u00f3n sin salida en relaci\u00f3n con Venezuela y Latinoam\u00e9rica\", afirm\u00f3 Maduro en el extracto emitido este jueves en ingl\u00e9s en la p\u00e1gina web general de CNN.\n A\u00f1adi\u00f3 que \"nuestro mensaje a los que gobiernan en Estados Unidos es que respeten Venezuela, que respeten Am\u00e9rica Latina y que establezcamos nuevos niveles de relaci\u00f3n\".\n Las protestas que sacuden Venezuela volvieron a tornarse violentas este jueves con dos muertes m\u00e1s que el Gobierno achaca a grupos fascistas.\n Las manifestaciones en Caracas y otras ciudades del pa\u00eds se han saldado hasta el momento con 19 muertos y al menos 300 heridos, seg\u00fan datos oficiales.\n Las protestas arrancaron el 12 de febrero con una marcha convocada por estudiantes y opositores que termin\u00f3 en violencia y en la que murieron tres personas y decenas resultaron heridas.  Esto desat\u00f3 inmediatamente numerosas manifestaciones, concentraciones, enfrentamientos y barricadas.\n En ese contexto, el Gobierno de Maduro ratific\u00f3 este jueves la suspensi\u00f3n de las relaciones con Panam\u00e1 por considerar que se entrometi\u00f3 en asuntos internos venezolanos al reclamar una reuni\u00f3n en la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos (OEA) sobre la situaci\u00f3n en Venezuela, encuentro que se celebra hoy en Washington.

La entrevista saldr\u00e1 al aire en CNN Internacional este viernes a las 13:00 horas (centro de M\u00e9xico).\n Semanas de protestas en contra del gobierno han sacudido a Venezuela y han provocado declaraciones agudas de Maduro, quien ha llamado a la paz mientras describe a los opositores como fascistas y extremistas.\n Los manifestantes dicen que la escasez de bienes, la inflaci\u00f3n y el alto crimen los llevaron a las calles.  Es la mayor amenaza que Maduro ha enfrentado desde su elecci\u00f3n, el a\u00f1o pasado.\n Uno de los l\u00edderes de la oposici\u00f3n que alent\u00f3 las protestas, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, est\u00e1 en la c\u00e1rcel y enfrenta cargos de incendio premeditado y conspiraci\u00f3n.\n Los manifestantes han acusado al gobierno de Maduro de la violencia que ha cobrado la vida de al menos 20 personas durante las protestas.  Los funcionarios del gobierno han acusado a L\u00f3pez y otros l\u00edderes de la oposici\u00f3n de alimentar la violencia y no hacer lo suficiente para detenerla.\n Mientras tanto, las tensiones diplom\u00e1ticas entre Estados Unidos y Venezuela han ido en aumento durante los disturbios.\n El mes pasado, Maduro expuls\u00f3 a tres diplom\u00e1ticos estadounidenses de Venezuela, acus\u00e1ndolos de conspirar contra su gobierno.  Estados Unidos expuls\u00f3 a tres diplom\u00e1ticos venezolanos la semana pasada, en reciprocidad.\n Pero Maduro tambi\u00e9n ha sugerido recientemente que quiere recomponer la relaci\u00f3n con Estados Unidos y reavivar las relaciones diplom\u00e1ticas.  El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Venezuela anunci\u00f3 la semana pasada que el pa\u00eds quer\u00eda enviar a Maximilian Arvelaez a Washington como su nuevo embajador, una posici\u00f3n que ha estado vacante desde 2008, cuando Venezuela expuls\u00f3 al embajador estadounidense y Estados Unidos hizo lo mismo con el venezolano en respuesta.\n El mes pasado, una vocera del Departamento de Estado dijo que Estados Unidos quiere desarrollar \"una relaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s constructiva con Venezuela\".\n \"Hemos dicho desde hace muchos meses que podr\u00eda incluir el intercambio de embajadores\", dijo la vocera Jen Psaki a periodistas.  \"Pero Venezuela tambi\u00e9n tiene que demostrar seriedad para que seamos capaces de avanzar.  Y las acciones recientes, incluida la expulsi\u00f3n de tres de nuestros diplom\u00e1ticos, siguen haci\u00e9ndolo muy dif\u00edcil\".\n Los anuncios de la expulsi\u00f3n de los diplom\u00e1ticos de menor nivel de Estados Unidos han sido una ocurrencia com\u00fan en Venezuela en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os.\n Pero la tensa relaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda cambiar, dijo Maduro a Amanpour.\n Cuando se le pregunt\u00f3 cu\u00e1l era su mensaje para Estados Unidos, el presidente de Venezuela no lo dud\u00f3.\n \"Mi mensaje es el respeto, el di\u00e1logo, la superaci\u00f3n de las visiones que se tienen acerca de Venezuela.  Precisamente, tom\u00e9 la decisi\u00f3n de designar a un nuevo embajador ante los Estados Unidos\", dijo Maduro.\n \"No entren en un callej\u00f3n sin salida en relaci\u00f3n con Venezuela y Am\u00e9rica Latina.
