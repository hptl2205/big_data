                    "body": "Ms Melua decided to set the spider free in her garden when she got home\n\nBy Charlotte Griffiths, Diary Editor For The Mail On Sunday\n\nHalloween week is traditionally a time for creepy tales, but pop star Katie Melua has a real-life horror story to top the lot.\n\nThe 30-year-old had been bugged by a scratching noise - and when she went to the doctor's to get it checked out, she discovered to her shock that it was caused by a spider living inside her ear.\n\nMelua - who once released a single called Spider's Web - believes the creature had previously been living in a pair of earbud headphones she recently used.\n\nOnce the doctor had removed the creature with a suction device, Ms Melua posted pictures of the unnerving find on Instagram.\n\nShe wrote alongside the picture: 'Basically I used these old in-ear monitors to block out sound on a flight, a little spider must have been in them and crawled inside my ear and stayed there for the week.\n\n'Though the thing looked terrifying up-close on the doctor's camera, once he took him out (using a micro-hoover) it was pretty small, and now it's in this little test tube, alive and seemingly fine.'\n\nAnd showing a surprising sang-froid, she added: 'It was no hassle at all, apart from the occasional shuffling noises.'\n\nA spokeswoman for the star, best known for hits such as Nine Million Bicycles and The Closest Thing To Crazy, said: 'The ear specialist said he'd never in his career taken out a live bug before. Plenty of dead ones. When it was out it was pretty tiny.\n\n'Katie kept it in the test tube and released it in her garden when she got home. Apart from shuffling and random noises in her ear, the spider was no bother for the entire week it lived there. She was relieved it was what it was as she was worried she was losing her hearing.'\n\nThe news comes two weeks after The Mail on Sunday reported how a London family found a deadly Brazilian spider delivered with bananas in their Waitrose shopping order.\n\nMs Melua's intruder was identified as a member of the salticidae - or jumping spider - family. They are common worldwide, but in Britain they rarely grow bigger than half an inch. Experts were, however, divided about how the spider might have survived for so long.\n\nDr Tim Cockerill, who presents the BBC series Spider House, said: 'I have never heard of this before.\n\n'But lots of spiders don't need to feed as frequently as you think. At this time of year spiders have been eating flies and are very well fed so they can survive weeks and weeks without food.\n\n'I don't think there is anything in anybody's ear that spiders would like to feed on.'\n\nBut Professor Brian Moore, a hearing expert at Cambridge University, said: 'Spiders like nice warm and slightly moist places and the ear can provide that. We often have very small lice and bed mites which get into our ear which a spider could live on.'\n\nBut he had some relatively comforting news: 'Eventually the spider would come out and lay its eggs in a suitable place - and I don't think that would be the ear.'",

Es una compa\u00f1era de trabajo muy especial a la que le tengo mucho aprecio\".\n\nAs\u00ed describe la cient\u00edfica colombiana Gladis Miriam Aparicio Rojas a la Nephila Clavipes, una ara\u00f1a nativa del continente americano que estudia desde hace a\u00f1os como parte de su doctorado.\n\nSu investigaci\u00f3n la llev\u00f3 a desarrollar una membrana conductora con el hilo de esta ara\u00f1a que le vali\u00f3 el \"Premio nacional al inventor colombiano 2014\" (avalado por la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual) y que podr\u00eda revolucionar el mundo de las bater\u00edas para los tel\u00e9fonos celulares.\n\n\"Lo que hice fue elaborar una membrana conductora que entre sus componentes tiene hilo de ara\u00f1a, un pol\u00edmero y un cer\u00e1mico\", le cuenta Aparicio Rojas a BBC Mundo.\n\n\"Este hilo, de una tonalidad dorada, tiene muy buenas propiedades mec\u00e1nicas: es mucho m\u00e1s flexible que el nailon y m\u00e1s resistente que el acero\", contin\u00faa la investigadora.\n\nVea: Una ara\u00f1a en plena cacer\u00eda\n\n\"Las bater\u00edas, que nosotros llamamos celdas combustibles, tienen dos componentes principales: los electrodos que producen la carga el\u00e9ctrica y una membrana que es la encargada de la conducci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda\", explica la cient\u00edfica.\n\nAl incorporar hilo de ara\u00f1a en la membrana, se mejoran enormemente sus propiedades conductoras, lo cual, en el caso de una bater\u00eda, extiende su vida \u00fatil y el tiempo de funcionamiento antes de la pr\u00f3xima recarga.\n\n\"Los valores de durabilidad de la membrana son muy amplios. Para saber exactamente cu\u00e1nto dura dentro de una bater\u00eda har\u00eda falta m\u00e1s desarrollo\", dice Aparicio Rojas.\n\n\"Pero en cuanto a la carga, en porcentajes, puede extender su duraci\u00f3n en un 30% o 40%\", a\u00f1ade.\n\nOtra ventaja es que es un material natural. En t\u00e9rminos ambientales, reduce el uso de elementos contaminantes utilizados com\u00fanmente en las pilas.\n\nLea: Los extra\u00f1os h\u00e1bitos de una ara\u00f1a sociable\n\nLa seda -o el hilo- de ara\u00f1a ha despertado desde hace varios a\u00f1os el inter\u00e9s de los cient\u00edficos. En el pasado, ha sido utilizado por la industria textil en la elaboraci\u00f3n de atuendos (hace un par de a\u00f1os crearon en Madagascar un vestido con hilos de m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de ara\u00f1as) y en la fabricaci\u00f3n de chalecos antibalas.\n\nEl inter\u00e9s cient\u00edfico ha estado enfocado principalmente en c\u00f3mo reproducir sus propiedades en un material sint\u00e9tico.\n\nSin embargo, \u00e9sta es la primera vez que se emplea el hilo para crear un material conductor.\n\n\"Yo quise dar un paso m\u00e1s e investigar sus aplicaciones\", le dice Aparicio Rojas a BBC Mundo, quien ve un futuro prometedor para la seda de la Nephila Clavipes.\n\n\"Podr\u00eda usarse por ejemplo como material en las carcasas de los celulares o para reemplazar otros materiales que son muy quebradizos, por su capacidad de resistir los golpes y el calor\".\n\nPor otra parte, agrega, \"el hilo de esta ara\u00f1a tiene un pH compatible con el del ser humano y por eso podr\u00eda utilizarse como un elemento para la regeneraci\u00f3n \u00f3sea, en implantes maxilofacial o, como tiene muy buenas propiedades de coagulaci\u00f3n, podr\u00eda aplicarse para hacer suturas\".\n\nEn cuanto a la metodolog\u00eda para obtener el hilo, la investigadora prefiere no dar demasiados detalles.\n\nComo no las puede criar, ni llevarlas al laboratorio, ni orde\u00f1arlas, tiene que visitar regularmente un vivero para recoger el fruto de la ara\u00f1a.\n\n\"Yo llego al vivero de la Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Occidente, veo que est\u00e9n de buen \u00e1nimo, que est\u00e9n comiendo y retiro la red que hayan tejido de forma natural\", dice.\n\nNo es f\u00e1cil manipularlo, explica, por el pegamento que se desprende del hilo.\n\nY con el hilo recolectado, Aparicio Rojas regresa al laboratorio a trabajar.",

Opera en 13 pa\u00edses y tiene su sede central en Reino Unido, donde aterriz\u00f3 en 2006. Adem\u00e1s de Espa\u00f1a, Dinamarca y UK Just Eat est\u00e1 presente en Canad\u00e1, Holanda, B\u00e9lgica, Irlanda, Francia, Suiza, Noruega, Italia, Brasil e India.\n\nEn la actualidad, en todo el mundo, Just Eat cuenta con casi 40.000 restaurantes afiliados en todo el mundo. Esto supone una facturaci\u00f3n en pedidos para sus restaurantes de m\u00e1s de 750 millones de libras al a\u00f1o.\n\nDesde su llegada a nuestro pa\u00eds, \u00bfc\u00f3mo ha sido la evoluci\u00f3n de la plataforma?\n\nJust Eat lleg\u00f3 a Espa\u00f1a en 2010. Comenz\u00f3 con una plantilla de 8 personas y ahora acabamos de estrenar nuevas oficinas en las que trabajamos m\u00e1s de 65 compa\u00f1eros.\n\nTeniendo en cuenta que operamos en 13 pa\u00edses del mundo, Espa\u00f1a se sit\u00faa entre el 4\u00ba - 5\u00ba puesto dentro de la compa\u00f1\u00eda. Es un caso de \u00e9xito absoluto porque es el pa\u00eds que m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido est\u00e1 creciendo en todos los ratios en la historia de la compa\u00f1\u00eda comparado con cualquier otro.\n\nCrece mes a mes m\u00e1s del 100%. Ha sido el pa\u00eds que antes ha llegado a 100.000 pedidos, al mayor n\u00famero de restaurantes y volumen de facturaci\u00f3n. Se trata de una tendencia que venimos observando desde hace muchos meses y es as\u00ed como estamos consolidando nuestra posici\u00f3n.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo se explica el elevado crecimiento que ha experimentado la compa\u00f1\u00eda en tan poco tiempo?\n\nEl cliente es quien nos hace crecer. Cuando llegamos a Espa\u00f1a s\u00f3lo 2,5 millones de personas utilizaban Internet a diario y ped\u00edan una comida a domicilio al mes. El problema no era de demanda, sino la oferta. Los usuarios, los internautas, solicitaban a gritos algo m\u00e1s que una pizza o comida china y Just Eat, desde su plataforma, ha aportado variedad, comodidad y un servicio r\u00e1pido y f\u00e1cil: en 3 clics la comida est\u00e1 pedida. Los factores clave de nuestro \u00e9xito son, b\u00e1sicamente, haber dado una respuesta a un mercado con una necesidad y haber aportado variedad donde no la hab\u00eda con una plataforma online de garant\u00eda.\n\nPor otra parte, es necesario recalcar ese cambio de h\u00e1bito que se ha producido en el usuario. Cada vez es m\u00e1s frecuente comer en casa o en la oficina, en lugar de salir a cenar o comer. Adem\u00e1s estamos demostrando que aportamos un valor a los restaurantes generamos negocio al sector local de hosteler\u00eda. Como empresa, Just Eat es una empresa que est\u00e1 en constante crecimiento y por tanto, pone los medios adecuados para, desde el punto de vista organizativo, mantener ese equilibrio.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1l es la competencia de Just Eat en Espa\u00f1a?\n\nLa competencia de Just Eat en Espa\u00f1a son operadores locales que no tienen la fuerte estructura y el know how de nuestra compa\u00f1\u00eda. Somos, claramente, los l\u00edderes con una interesante distancia respecto a las empresas locales que he mencionado.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo explica que este modelo de negocio en Internet sea clave para el sector de la restauraci\u00f3n a la hora de afrontar la crisis?\n\nEn esta plataforma de oferta y demanda todos salen beneficiados. Los restaurantes han descubierto en Just Eat c\u00f3mo hacer crecer su clientela y facturaci\u00f3n. Si el cliente no va al restaurante, el restaurante va al cliente; y en tan solo dos meses, la rentabilidad ya es una realidad para ellos. As\u00ed, en una \u00e9poca de crisis en la que el sector de la restauraci\u00f3n es uno de los que m\u00e1s la sufre, unirse a estos modelos de negocio en Internet puede ser una decisi\u00f3n muy fruct\u00edfera.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 beneficios ofrece la plataforma al restaurador? \u00bfY al usuario?\n\nJust Eat ofrece a los restaurantes la posibilidad no solo de disponer de una nueva l\u00ednea de negocio sin la necesidad de invertir en desarrollos tecnol\u00f3gicos, sino tambi\u00e9n la consecuci\u00f3n, de media, de entre un 15 y un 25% m\u00e1s de facturaci\u00f3n, as\u00ed como la disposici\u00f3n de diversas herramientas de marketing para darse a conocer. Adem\u00e1s le ofrecemos todo el apoyo de marketing que necesite y una importante visibilidad en la plataforma.\n\nAl usuario le aportamos la posibilidad de comprar al mejor precio; desde un mismo sitio, un consumidor puede ver y comparar toda la oferta que hay para un mismo tipo de comida, pudiendo elegir la m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mica o la que mejor relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio le ofrezca. Al fin y al cabo, calidad de vida. Le damos la posibilidad de dedicarse m\u00e1s a sus hobbies, a su familia, a sus amigos y que no pierda tiempo en la cocina.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo ha sido el balance de 2013? (n\u00ba de restaurantes adheridos, pedidos gestionados, ampliaci\u00f3n de equipo de Just Eat Espa\u00f1a...)\n\nEstamos creciendo de una manera exponencial y desde el asentamiento de las bases, acompa\u00f1ando nuestro crecimiento con el de recursos humanos para dar un buen servicio a nuestros clientes y para atender todos los canales de comunicaci\u00f3n con ellos.\n\nPodemos indicar que este a\u00f1o hemos triplicado el n\u00famero de pedidos respecto al a\u00f1o anterior, por encima del objetivo previsto.\n\nNuestra oferta permite cubrir ya el 80% de la poblaci\u00f3n de Espa\u00f1a, ya que estamos presentes en m\u00e1s de 400 localidades. En cuanto a cuota de mercado, estamos muy por encima de los competidores.\n\nMes a mes seguimos incorporando nuevos profesionales en todos los departamentos. Despu\u00e9s de contar con una nueva sede, tenemos muy claro que el nivel de desarrollo y de crecimiento del negocio debe ir acompa\u00f1ado por un crecimiento de los equipos que lo sostienen.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 objetivos a corto y medio plazo se han marcado para Espa\u00f1a en 2014?\n\nQueremos continuar con el liderazgo en el mercado espa\u00f1ol. Queremos reforzar nuestro modelo de negocio porque creemos que es el de mayor sostenibilidad y los datos nos avalan. Por supuesto, queremos seguir incrementando nuestra oferta y captar nuevos clientes. Nuestra marca, Just Eat, ya est\u00e1 implantada en Espa\u00f1a, ya es conocida y notoria, por lo que nuestro objetivo es crecer con los altos est\u00e1ndares de calidad que nos identifican.",
