The Enola Gay was a U.S. B-29 Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb in World War II over Hiroshima, Japan. Theodore \"Dutch\" Van Kirk was the navigator on that plane.\n\nThe single bomb blast killed about 140000 people and helped end World War II, pushing the world into the nuclear era at the same time. CNN reports that Van Kirk's death means there are no surviving members left of the Enola Gay's crew who, by following orders, became an integral part in the ongoing debate over nuclear weapons.\n\nVan Kirk flew dozens of missions for the U.S. military in Europe and North Africa, but history remembers him and others aboard the Enola Gay for their actions the morning of August 6, 1945. By then, the navigator flew 15 missions out of England and about 10 more out of North Africa.\n\nHe returned the United States with new orders and trained \"primarily to make the rapid turn and running away from the bomb.\" Van Kirk recalled decades later to CNN:\n\n\"You didn't see anything except a bright flash and the airplane. You saw a white cloud hanging over the city. You saw the -- underneath the could the entire city was just entirely covered with smoke and dust, it looked like a pot of boiling water.\"\n\nThree days after the Enola Gay crew unleashed the bomb called \"Little Boy\" on Hiroshima, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing 80,000 people.\n\nMSN News notes that the use of the atomic bomb has been debated endlessly ever since. Van Kirk stated in a 2005 interview that he still supported the use of the bomb, saying, \"I honestly believe the use of the atomic bomb saved lives in the long run. there were a lot of lives saved. Most of the lives saved were Japanese.\"\n\nStill, the Enola Gay navigator conceded that his experience in World War II showed him \"that wars don't settle anything.\" He added, \"And atomic weapons don't settle anything. I personally think there shouldn't be any atomic bombs in the world -- I'd like to see them all abolished.\"\n\nTheodore Van Kirk was teamed with pilot Paul Tibbets and bombardier Tom Ferebee for the mission aboard the B-29 Superfortress. Like many World War II veterans, Van Kirk didn't speak about his experiences until much later in his life.\n\nHis son, Tom Van Kirk, explained, \"I didn't even find out that he was on that mission until I was 10 years old and read some old news clippings in my grandmother's attic.\"\n\nWhile the last crewmember from the Enola Gay has passed away, the mission and its consequences will live on in debate and memory for many more generations.\n\n[Image via The Mirror]",

He was 93.\n\nHis son, Thomas, confirmed the death.\n\nIn the predawn hours of Aug. 6, 1945, the Enola Gay, piloted by Col. Paul W. Tibbets Jr. and carrying a crew of 12, took off from Tinian in the Mariana Islands with a uranium bomb built under extraordinary secrecy in the vast Manhattan Project.\n\nCapt. Van Kirk spread out his navigation charts on a small table behind Tibbets' seat. From that spot, at the end of a long tunnel atop the bomb bays, he took the plane's bearings, using a hand-held sextant to guide with the stars.\n\nWhen the Enola Gay reached Iwo Jima as the sun rose, it began an ascent to 31,000 feet. At 8:15 a.m. Japan time, it reached Hiroshima, a city of 250,000 and the site of an important army headquarters.\n\nThe bombardier, Maj. Thomas W. Ferebee, said, \"I got it,\" announcing that the Enola Gay was over his aiming point, the T-shaped Aioi Bridge. Van Kirk, who had also familiarized himself with Hiroshima's landmarks, leaned over Ferebee's shoulder and confirmed he was correct. His navigating skills had brought the Enola Gay to its target only a few seconds behind schedule at the conclusion of a 6 1/2-hour flight.\n\nFerebee released the bomb, known as Little Boy, and 43 seconds later, at 1,890 feet above ground zero, it exploded in a nuclear inferno, leaving tens of thousands dead or dying and turning Hiroshima into scorched devastation.\n\nTibbets executed a diving turn to avoid the blast effects, but the Enola Gay was buffeted by a pair of shock waves. A flash of light that Van Kirk likened to a photographer's flashbulb engulfed the cabin.\n\n\"The plane jumped and made a sound like sheet metal snapping,\" Van Kirk told The New York Times on the 50th anniversary of the Hiroshima raid. \"Shortly after the second wave, we turned to where we could look out and see the cloud, where the city of Hiroshima had been.\"\n\nHe added: \"The entire city was covered with smoke and dust and dirt. I describe it looking like a pot of black, boiling tar. You could see some fires burning on the edge of the city.\"\n\nVan Kirk remembered \"a sense of relief.\"\n\n\"Even though you were still up there in the air and no one else in the world knew what had happened, you just sort of had a sense that the war was over, or would be soon,\" he told Bob Greene in Greene's 2000 book, \"Duty.\"\n\nShortly before 3 p.m., the crewmen returned to Tinian and were greeted, as Van Kirk told it, by \"more generals and admirals than I had ever seen in one place in my life.\"\n\nThree days later, another B-29 dropped a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki. On Aug. 15, Japan surrendered, bringing World War II to an end.\n\nTheodore Van Kirk - everybody called him Dutch - was born and reared in Northumberland, Pennsylvania. He attended Susquehanna College for a year, then became an Army Air Forces cadet in October 1941.\n\nTibbets, flying with the 8th Air Force out of England, selected Van Kirk and Ferebee for his crew the next year. Their B-17 Flying Fortress, named Red Gremlin, became the lead plane in the 97th Bomb Group's missions and flew Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to Gibraltar in November 1942 in preparation for the invasion of North Africa.\n\nAfter 58 missions over Europe and North Africa, Van Kirk returned to the U.S. to train navigators. When Tibbets was selected to command the 509th Composite Group, a unit of 1,800 airmen assembled in Utah in the fall of 1944 to train for delivering the atomic bomb, he brought Van Kirk and Ferebee with him. This time they trained on the newly developed B-29s.\n\nAs Van Kirk recalled Tibbets' words in a 2005 Time magazine interview: \"He told me, 'We're going to do something that I can't tell you about right now, but if it works, it will end or significantly shorten the war.' And I thought, 'Oh, yeah, buddy, I've heard that before.'\"\n\nIn the summer of 1945, the 509th conducted its final training on Tinian, and President Harry S. Truman gave the order to drop the atomic bomb.\n\nVan Kirk retired from military service in 1946 as a major, having received the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from Bucknell University and became a marketing executive with DuPont.\n\nBesides his son Thomas, survivors include another son, Larry; two daughters, Vicki Triplett and Joanne Gotelli; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nThe crews that dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were seen by Americans as saviors for ending the war. But over the years, the morality of atomic warfare and the need for the bombings has been questioned.\n\nVan Kirk joined his fellow crewmen in unwavering defense of the atomic raids.\n\n\"We were fighting an enemy that had a reputation for never surrendering, never accepting defeat,\" he said. \"It's really hard to talk about morality and war in the same sentence.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Where was the morality in the bombing of Coventry, or the bombing of Dresden, or the Bataan Death March, or the Rape of Nanking, or the bombing of Pearl Harbor? I believe that when you're in a war, a nation must have the courage to do what it must to win the war with a minimum loss of lives.\"",

Once over its target, the Enola Gay unloaded the first atomic bomb dropped in war.\n\nA single bomb blast killed some 140,000 people and helped end World War II -- and pushed the world suddenly into the nuclear era.\n\nOn Monday, Van Kirk died of natural causes at the Park Springs retirement community in Stone Mountain, Georgia, according to his eldest daughter Vicki Triplett.\n\nHe was 93.\n\nHis death means there are now no surviving members of the Enola Gay's crew who, by doing their jobs, became an early and integral part in the ongoing narrative over nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile in the U.S. military, Van Kirk flew dozens of missions in Europe and North Africa. Yet the history books will largely remember him and others aboard that B-29 for the morning of August 6, 1945.\n\nBy then, Van Kirk had flown about 15 missions out of England and about 10 more out of North Africa. He then returned to the United States with new orders, training \"primarily to make the rapid turn and running away from the bomb,\" Van Kirk recalled decades later to CNN.\n\nThey dropped the bomb dubbed \"Little Boy\" around 8:15 a.m.\n\n\"You didn't see anything except a bright flash and the airplane,\" Van Kirk recalled. \"You saw a white cloud hanging over the city. You saw the -- underneath the cloud the entire city was just entirely covered with smoke and dust, and it looked like a pot of boiling oil down there.\"\n\nHis first thought when the bomb fell was \"'God, I'm glad it worked ... Number two, the thoughts were, 'This war is over.' And that was good. That was good.'\"\n\nThree days later, another atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered soon after that, ending the bloody war in the Pacific and, in so doing, preventing a U.S. land invasion.\n\nIt also set the stage for what would become known as the Cold War -- a nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and United States that would go on for decades -- as well as concerns about developing nuclear weaponry that persist in places like North Korea and Iran to this day.\n\nTom Van Kirk told CNN on Tuesday that his father \"felt no regrets about\" the Hiroshima mission.\n\nAt the same time, he said \"Dutch\" Van Kirk's life was much more than that.\n\nAfter the war, Van Kirk left the military, got his master's degree in chemical engineering at Bucknell University, then had a long career working for DuPont. He retired in 1985 -- a decade after his wife's death -- and remained active, eventually settling in Georgia near one of his daughters.\n\nHe will be buried in Northumberland -- the central Pennsylvania city in which he was born -- alongside his wife, Tom Van Kirk said. Together, the couple had four children, seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren.\n\n\"We treasure the fact that we had my dad for 93\u00bd years,\" said Tom Van Kirk. \"He was a great father.\"",

He later told reporters that after seeing one atomic bomb explode in war, he never wanted to see another one used again.\n\nBut he defended the use of the bomb, describing it as the lesser of two evils when compared to the continued aerial assault of the Japanese main islands and a planned US invasion.\n\n\"The bomb really saved lives, in spite of the tremendous number of casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because the destruction that would have been caused in Japan otherwise would have been tremendous,\" he said in an oral history for Georgia Public Broadcasting.\n\nThe US B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, carrying 12 crew members, dropped the atomic bomb, nicknamed \"Little Boy\", on Hiroshima in the closing days of World War Two. The death toll from the blast by the end of the year was estimated at about 140,000, out of the total of 350,000 who lived there at the time.\n\nThree days after the Hiroshima bombing, the United States dropped an atomic bomb nicknamed \"Fat Man\" on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on August 15th, 1945, bringing World War Two to an end.\n\nThe Pennsylvania-born Van Kirk flew missions in Europe during the war and visited Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic blast there. He studied chemical engineering after the war and became an executive with DuPont.\n\nHe said the Hiroshima mission was relatively easy, with no anti-aircraft fire coming from the ground. The big worry was whether the plane would blow up after the bomb detonated, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting.\n\nHe said that 43 seconds after the bomb was dropped, he saw a flash from the blast. A shockwave then came and shook the aircraft.\n\nOfficials at the Park Springs Retirement Community in Stone Mountain, a suburb of Atlanta, confirmed his death, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Local broadcasters also quoted his son as confirming the death.\n\nA funeral for Van Kirk is planned for August 5th in his hometown of Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the paper said.",

At 8:15 a.m. Japan time, it reached Hiroshima, a city of 250,000 and the site of an important army headquarters.\n\nThe bombardier, Maj. Thomas W. Ferebee, said, \"I got it,\" announcing that the Enola Gay was over his aiming point, the T-shaped Aioi Bridge. Captain Van Kirk, who had also familiarized himself with Hiroshima's landmarks, leaned over Major Ferebee's shoulder and confirmed he was correct. His navigating skills had brought the Enola Gay to its target only a few seconds behind schedule at the conclusion of a six-and-a-half-hour flight.\n\nMajor Ferebee released the bomb, known as Little Boy, and 43 seconds later, at 1,890 feet above ground zero, it exploded in a nuclear inferno, leaving tens of thousands dead or dying and turning Hiroshima into scorched devastation.\n\nColonel Tibbets executed a diving turn to avoid the blast effects, but the Enola Gay was buffeted by a pair of shock waves. A flash of light that Mr. Van Kirk likened to a photographer's flashbulb engulfed the cabin.\n\n\"The plane jumped and made a sound like sheet metal snapping,\" Mr. Van Kirk told The New York Times on the 50th anniversary of the Hiroshima raid. \"Shortly after the second wave, we turned to where we could look out and see the cloud, where the city of Hiroshima had been.\"\n\nHe added: \"The entire city was covered with smoke and dust and dirt. I describe it looking like a pot of black, boiling tar. You could see some fires burning on the edge of the city.\"\n\nMr. Van Kirk remembered \"a sense of relief.\"\n\n\"Even though you were still up there in the air and no one else in the world knew what had happened, you just sort of had a sense that the war was over, or would be soon,\" he told Bob Greene in Mr. Greene's 2000 book, \"Duty.\"\n\nShortly before 3 p.m., the crewmen returned to Tinian and were greeted, as Mr. Van Kirk told it, by \"more generals and admirals than I had ever seen in one place in my life.\"\n\nThree days later, another B-29 dropped a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki. On Aug. 15, Japan surrendered, bringing World War II to an end.\n\nTheodore Van Kirk -- everybody called him Dutch -- was born and reared in Northumberland, Pa. He attended Susquehanna College for a year, then became an Army Air Forces cadet in October 1941.\n\nColonel Tibbets, flying with the Eighth Air Force out of England, selected Captain Van Kirk and Major Ferebee for his crew the next year. Their B-17 Flying Fortress, named Red Gremlin, became the lead plane in the 97th Bomb Group's missions and flew Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to Gibraltar in November 1942 in preparation for the invasion of North Africa.\n\nAfter 58 missions over Europe and North Africa, Captain Van Kirk returned to the United States to train navigators. When Colonel Tibbets was selected to command the 509th Composite Group, a unit of 1,800 airmen assembled in Utah in the fall of 1944 to train for delivering the atomic bomb, he brought Captain Van Kirk and Major Ferebee with him. This time they trained on the newly developed B-29s.\n\nAs Mr. Van Kirk recalled Colonel Tibbets's words in a 2005 Time magazine interview: \"He told me, 'We're going to do something that I can't tell you about right now, but if it works, it will end or significantly shorten the war.' And I thought, 'Oh, yeah, buddy, I've heard that before.' \"\n\nIn the summer of 1945, the 509th conducted its final training on Tinian, and President Harry S. Truman gave the order to drop the atomic bomb.\n\nMr. Van Kirk retired from military service in 1946 as a major, having received the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from Bucknell University and became a marketing executive with DuPont.\n\nBesides his son Thomas, survivors include another son, Larry; two daughters, Vicki Triplett and Joanne Gotelli; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nThe crews that dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were seen by Americans as saviors for ending the war. But over the years, the morality of atomic warfare and the need for the bombings has been questioned.\n\nMr. Van Kirk joined his fellow crewmen in unwavering defense of the atomic raids.\n\n\"We were fighting an enemy that had a reputation for never surrendering, never accepting defeat,\" he said. \"It's really hard to talk about morality and war in the same sentence.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Where was the morality in the bombing of Coventry, or the bombing of Dresden, or the Bataan Death March, or the Rape of Nanking, or the bombing of Pearl Harbor? I believe that when you're in a war, a nation must have the courage to do what it must to win the war with a minimum loss of lives.\"",

He later told reporters that after seeing one atomic bomb explode in war, he never wanted to see another one used again.\n\nBut he defended the use of the bomb, describing it as the lesser of two evils when compared to the continued aerial assault of the Japanese main islands and a planned U.S. invasion.\n\n\"The bomb really saved lives, in spite of the tremendous number of casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, because the destruction that would have been caused in Japan otherwise would have been tremendous,\" he said in an oral history for Georgia Public Broadcasting.\n\nThe U.S. B-29 Superfortress Enola Gay, carrying 12 crew members, dropped the atomic bomb, nicknamed \"Little Boy\", on Hiroshima in the closing days of World War Two. The death toll from the blast by the end of the year was estimated at about 140,000, out of the total of 350,000 who lived there at the time.\n\nThree days after the Hiroshima bombing, the United States dropped an atomic bomb nicknamed \"Fat Man\" on Nagasaki. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, bringing World War Two to an end.\n\nThe Pennsylvania-born Van Kirk flew missions in Europe during the war and visited Nagasaki in the aftermath of the atomic blast there. He studied chemical engineering after the war and became an executive with DuPont.\n\nHe said the Hiroshima mission was relatively easy, with no anti-aircraft fire coming from the ground. The big worry was whether the plane would blow up after the bomb detonated, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting.\n\nHe said that 43 seconds after the bomb was dropped, he saw a flash from the blast. A shockwave then came and shook the aircraft.\n\nOfficials at the Park Springs Retirement Community in Stone Mountain, a suburb of Atlanta, confirmed his death, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Local broadcasters also quoted his son as confirming the death.\n\nA funeral for Van Kirk is planned for Aug. 5 in his hometown of Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the paper said.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Kaminsky in New Orleans and Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Peter Cooney)",

                    "body": "Think of it as the true end of the beginning. Last week, Theodore \"Dutch\" Van Kirk, the final member of the 12-man crew of the Enola Gay, the plane (named after its pilot's supportive mother) that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, died at age 93. When that first A-bomb left its bomb bay at 8:15 on the morning of August 6, 1945, and began its descent toward its target, the Aioli (\"Live Together\") Bridge, it was inscribed with a series of American messages, some obscene, including \"Greetings to the Emperor from the men of the Indianapolis.\" (That ship had delivered to the Pacific island of Tinian parts of the very bomb that would turn Hiroshima into an inferno of smoke and fire -- \"that awful cloud,\" Paul Tibbetts, Jr., the Enola Gay's pilot, would call it -- and afterward was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine with the loss of hundreds of sailors.)\n\nThe bomb, dubbed Little Boy, that had gestated in the belly of the Enola Gay represented not only the near endpoint of a bitter global war of almost unimaginable destruction, but the birthing of something new. The way for its use had been paved by an evolution in warfare: the increasing targeting of civilian populations from the air (something that can be seen again today in the carnage of Gaza). The history of that grim development extends from German airship bombings of London (1915) by way of Guernica (1937), Shanghai (1937), and Coventry (1940), to the fire bombings of Dresden (1945) and Tokyo (1945) in the last year of World War II. It even had an evolutionary history in the human imagination, where for decades writers (among others) had dreamed of the unparalleled release of previously unknown forms of energy for military purposes.\n\nOn August 7, 1945, a previous age was ending and a new one was dawning. In the nuclear era, city-busting weapons would be a dime a dozen and would spread from the superpowers to many other countries, including Great Britain, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. Targeted by the planet's major nuclear arsenals would be the civilian inhabitants not just of single cities but of scores and scores of cities, even of the planet itself. On August 6th, 70 years ago, the possibility of the apocalypse passed out of the hands of God or the gods and into human hands, which meant a new kind of history had begun whose endpoint is unknowable, though we do know that even a \"modest\" exchange of nuclear weapons between India and Pakistan would not only devastate South Asia, but thanks to the phenomenon of nuclear winter also cause widespread famine on a planetary scale.\n\nIn other words, 70 years later, the apocalypse is us. Yet in the United States, the only nuclear bomb you're likely to read about is Iran's (even though that country possesses no such weapon). For a serious discussion of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, those more than 4,800 increasingly ill-kept weapons that could incinerate several Earth-sized planets, you need to look not to the country's major newspapers or news programs but to comic John Oliver -- or TomDispatch regular Noam Chomsky. Tom\n\nHow Many Minutes to Midnight?\n\nHiroshima Day 2014\n\nBy Noam Chomsky\n\nIf some extraterrestrial species were compiling a history of Homo sapiens, they might well break their calendar into two eras: BNW (before nuclear weapons) and NWE (the nuclear weapons era). The latter era, of course, opened on August 6, 1945, the first day of the countdown to what may be the inglorious end of this strange species, which attained the intelligence to discover the effective means to destroy itself, but -- so the evidence suggests -- not the moral and intellectual capacity to control its worst instincts.\n\nDay one of the NWE was marked by the \"success\" of Little Boy, a simple atomic bomb. On day four, Nagasaki experienced the technological triumph of Fat Man, a more sophisticated design. Five days later came what the official Air Force history calls the \"grand finale,\" a 1,000-plane raid -- no mean logistical achievement -- attacking Japan's cities and killing many thousands of people, with leaflets falling among the bombs reading \"Japan has surrendered.\" Truman announced that surrender before the last B-29 returned to its base.\n\nThose were the auspicious opening days of the NWE. As we now enter its 70th year, we should be contemplating with wonder that we have survived. We can only guess how many years remain.",

El pr\u00f3ximo 5 de Agosto ser\u00e1 enterrado junto a su mujer en su ciudad natal, Northumberland (Pennsylvania), en una ceremonia privada.\n\nApodado por sus amigos como 'el Holand\u00e9s', Van Kirk sinti\u00f3 desde 2010 la responsabilidad de convertirse en el \u00faltimo superviviente del m\u00edtico B-29 que llev\u00f3 a cabo la misi\u00f3n clave de finales de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, consciente de que a partir de entonces le tocaba a \u00e9l responder a todas las preguntas. El capit\u00e1n recordaba entonces junto a The Guardian, coincidiendo con el 65 aniversario, el lanzamiento de la bomba at\u00f3mica que arras\u00f3 la ciudad de Hiroshima.\n\nEn plena Guerra Mundial, todos los miembros de la tripulaci\u00f3n fueron reunidos en Utah, en un entorno de alto secreto, y con la intenci\u00f3n de ser entrenados para una misi\u00f3n sin especificar. \"Nos dijeron que \u00edbamos a hacer algo que pondr\u00eda fin o acortar\u00eda significativamente la guerra\", declar\u00f3 al diario brit\u00e1nico. Aunque nadie lleg\u00f3 a decirles que se trataba del lanzamiento de una bomba at\u00f3mica, Van Kirk y sus compa\u00f1eros lo imaginaron al ver compartiendo base militar a un gran n\u00famero de reconocidos f\u00edsicos.\n\nDurante casi seis meses fueron minuciosamente preparados en la base 509\u00ba de Wendover, donde el 14 de Junio de 1945 aterrizaba el avi\u00f3n bombardero con el que entrar\u00edan a formar parte de la historia. El 5 de Agosto, un d\u00eda antes de la acci\u00f3n, se les inform\u00f3 en una reuni\u00f3n final de que iban a lanzar una bomba diferente a todas las que hasta entonces se hab\u00edan conocido. Se les advirti\u00f3 de que era un arma tan potente que el avi\u00f3n deb\u00eda estar al menos a 11 kil\u00f3metros de distancia cuando estallara, o el Enola Gay se desmenuzar\u00eda con ella. A\u00fan entonces la palabra 'at\u00f3mica' no se pronunci\u00f3 ni una sola vez.\n\nLa noche antes del ataque los miembros de la tripulaci\u00f3n pasaron las horas jugando a las cartas. \"Nos dijeron lo que \u00edbamos a hacer y nos pidieron que descans\u00e1ramos, pero nos fue imposible\". El 6 de Agosto a las 2.45 de la ma\u00f1ana, y desde la isla de Tinian, la tripulaci\u00f3n part\u00eda hacia Hiroshima. Durante la entrevista Van Kirk mostr\u00f3 uno de los facs\u00edmiles que guardaba en una peque\u00f1a caja en su despacho. En \u00e9l se pod\u00eda leer \"8:15, Bomb Away\". Little Boy, como fue bautizada la primera bomba at\u00f3mica de la historia, cay\u00f3 durante 43 segundos hasta estallar en la ciudad nipona. Aunque en ese tiempo el avi\u00f3n logr\u00f3 alejarles hasta casi veinte kil\u00f3metros del lugar, fue alcanzado por la onda expansiva, lo que oblig\u00f3 al piloto Paul Tibbets a realizar una complicada maniobra para enderezar el vuelo. Doce horas y trece minutos despu\u00e9s, el Enola Gay les devolv\u00eda sanos y salvos a la base.\n\nLa acci\u00f3n militar que fue clave en el fin de la Guerra Mundial arras\u00f3 la ciudad de Hiroshima, y se cobr\u00f3 la vida de miles de personas, la mayor\u00eda de ellas civiles. Las consecuencias de las emisiones radiactivas de la bomba fueron sufridas por la poblaci\u00f3n durante d\u00e9cadas. A pesar de las terribles secuelas del ataque, Van Kirk nunca se arrepinti\u00f3 de formar parte de la misi\u00f3n. Durante la entrevista afirm\u00f3 que el final de la cruenta guerra fue posible gracias a ellos. \"Estoy orgulloso de haber participado, y en las mismas circunstancias, lo har\u00eda otra vez\", afirm\u00f3. Cuando el periodista, extra\u00f1ado por la ausencia total de remordimientos, le pregunt\u00f3 por c\u00f3mo fue capaz de afrontar el ataque deliberado a miles de civiles, 'el Holand\u00e9s' sentenci\u00f3 que quien no es capaz de lidiar con ello, es que no merece la pena como aviador. \"No conozco otra forma de luchar en una guerra si no es matando gente\", zanj\u00f3. Incluso a pesar de su visita a Nagasaki, pocas horas despu\u00e9s del segundo ataque de EE.UU, Van Kirk afirm\u00f3 que la visi\u00f3n de las v\u00edctimas calcinadas por la explosi\u00f3n no le rob\u00f3 una sola noche de sue\u00f1o. \"Eres inmune porque durante todo tu entrenamiento te preparan para lo que vas a hacer\".\n\nSi a pesar de la f\u00e9rrea formaci\u00f3n a la que se someti\u00f3 la conciencia hubiera asomado en un momento de debilidad, Harry Truman le libr\u00f3 de cualquier responsabilidad cuando se encontr\u00f3 con ellos el verano de 1945. \"Yo soy el tipo que te mand\u00f3 all\u00ed; si alguien te molesta por ello, m\u00e1ndamelo a m\u00ed\", le dijo el entonces presidente de Estados Unidos.",

A fines de 1945, la cantidad de muertos hab\u00eda llegado a 140 000, de una poblaci\u00f3n estimada de 350 000. Tres d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, Estados Unidos lanz\u00f3 una bomba \"Fat Man\" (Hombre gordo) en Nagasaki. Jap\u00f3n se rindi\u00f3 el 15 de agosto de 1945\". Y ese fue el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\n\nSiempre me he preguntado si quienes aprietan el gatillo del holocausto viven tranquilos. Siempre he querido saber si hombres como el miembro de la tripulaci\u00f3n del bombardero estadounidense vivi\u00f3 leve o densamente hasta el \u00faltimo instante. Porque estuve hace una d\u00e9cada en el Museo Conmemorativo de la Paz de Hiroshima, y mis ojos no alcanzaban para todo el dolor que all\u00ed pod\u00eda apreciarse.\n\nNo olvido la bata hecha jirones de una ni\u00f1a. En mi mente, con total nitidez, persisten las im\u00e1genes y maquetas de una ciudad arrasada, literalmente aplanada, y resuenan las palabras de una estudiante adolescente, v\u00edctima que no pudo haber sobrevivido mucho tiempo a las radiaciones de la hora cero: \"Un resplandor azul me atraves\u00f3 los ojos...\".\n\nA solo metros del Museo, grabada sobre una piedra un poco m\u00e1s alta que el tama\u00f1o de un hombre, pude leer esta frase aquel d\u00eda inolvidable: \"Calmar el alma\", y no lejos, una leyenda esculpida en japon\u00e9s: \"Roguemos para que todas las almas que aqu\u00ed yacen descansen en paz, porque nosotros no repetiremos esta maldad\".\n\nPor lo visto ni siquiera las lecciones m\u00e1s duras sirven para dejar atr\u00e1s cap\u00edtulos que nos averg\u00fcenzan como especie: \u00bfAlg\u00fan d\u00eda perder\u00e1n el sue\u00f1o los j\u00f3venes soldados de Israel que ahora lanzan proyectiles devastadores sobre la humanidad de Gaza? Entre tantas im\u00e1genes espeluznantes que asoman desde Telesur, me ha sobrecogido la de esos militares lanzando fuego sobre un blanco para ellos sin importancia, como diana abstracta. Acometen su tarea macabra como acto ordinario, como si no estuvieran destruyendo la vida de sus semejantes.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 mundo es este en el cual miramos d\u00eda a d\u00eda, abismados e impotentes, como hombres y mujeres, ancianos y ni\u00f1os mueren por cientos en tan solo d\u00edas? En Gaza, los ni\u00f1os muertos parecen muchas veces estar mirando al cielo, se quedan en el \u00faltimo instante con la cabeza hacia arriba, con los ojos cristalinos y los brazos abiertos. Son los mismos brazos diminutos, a veces hasta m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os, de mi peque\u00f1a Elena, que en estos d\u00edas de excedido calor se desvela por jugar con sus amigos en una paz que nos parece lo m\u00e1s natural del mundo, cuando en verdad es un verdadero milagro, es el fruto de muchos a\u00f1os de batallar en los caminos del valor y de la inteligencia.\n\nMarx, el sabio \"aguafiestas\" -- como el mismo se dibuj\u00f3 -- , ten\u00eda raz\u00f3n: estamos en la prehistoria de nosotros mismos. En la civilizaci\u00f3n nuestra, la cara oscura de la moneda ha tomado ventaja al amor, y hay que estar muy alertas, conscientes de la gravedad de los hechos, y en consecuencia actuar, pues no tiene sentido ir por la vida sin saber estremecerse con el dolor del Hombre. No tiene sentido pasar anodinamente como si las ondas expansivas de la barbarie jam\u00e1s fuesen a tocar la orilla de nuestra fr\u00e1gil suerte.",

Ten\u00eda nombre: Little Boy. El 60 por ciento de los edificios fue destruido. M\u00e1s de 80.000 personas murieron en el acto y 160.000 sufrieron quemaduras y heridas que los condenaron a vivir llagados toda la vida. Un castigo inaudito. La tripulaci\u00f3n no sab\u00eda si el vendaval que produjo la explosi\u00f3n derrumbar\u00eda el aeroplano. Se salvaron. Antes de este 69 aniversario, hace una semana, muri\u00f3 el \u00faltimo de los tripulantes del Enola Gay.\n\nInvitado hace 16 a\u00f1os por el gobierno de Jap\u00f3n, visit\u00e9 la plaza conmemorativa donde cay\u00f3 la bomba y donde un museo recuerda el acontecimiento. La destrucci\u00f3n fue reparada con los a\u00f1os. Innumerables edificios modernos rodean el lugar. Caminar por all\u00ed me produjo un llanto silencioso que finaliz\u00f3 cuando vi a dos parejas de adolescentes bes\u00e1ndose en los bancos del lugar. La vida florec\u00eda en ese rinc\u00f3n de muerte masiva. No puedo olvidarme de ese momento. Los adolescentes parec\u00edan estar vulnerando, faltando el respeto al pasado. Pero en realidad -luego de esa primera impresi\u00f3n- estaban trayendo esperanza en la perduraci\u00f3n de la especie humana.\n\nFue el eminente cient\u00edfico Albert Einstein, exiliado en los Estados Unidos, quien convenci\u00f3 al presidente Franklin D. Roosevelt de fabricar este terror\u00edfico artefacto de muerte. Se lo prepar\u00f3 a lo largo de los \u00faltimos tres a\u00f1os de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y sometido a ensayos. Los cient\u00edficos -trabajaron profesionales de todas las nacionalidades- estaban urgidos porque les preocupaba que los alemanes, y no los japoneses, tuvieran esta arma mort\u00edfera. Los historiadores ense\u00f1an que el hitlerismo no dispon\u00eda de ella, los estudios no hab\u00edan concluido. Berl\u00edn s\u00ed estaba respaldada por coheter\u00eda de largo alcance, como los V-1 y los V-2 que asolaron Londres en el \u00faltimo per\u00edodo del enfrentamiento b\u00e9lico. Los que los construyeron encontraron asilo en Estados Unidos y colaboraron en poner al hombre en la Luna.\n\nA Estados Unidos le costaba un enorme esfuerzo reconquistar el Pac\u00edfico ocupado por las tropas japonesas. Esfuerzo en armamento y en p\u00e9rdidas humanas. El Ej\u00e9rcito Imperial estaba decidido a combatir hasta el final, en parte por un orgullo ancestral y en parte debido al miedo de una sublevaci\u00f3n comunista interna. Los l\u00edderes nipones -explica el investigador brit\u00e1nico Anthony Beevor- consideraban inviable una rendici\u00f3n. En las \"Instrucciones para el Servicio Militar\" del general Tojo (quien realmente mandaba en Jap\u00f3n), se declaraba: \"No sobrevivas en la verg\u00fcenza como prisionero. Muere, para asegurarte que tras de ti no has dejado rastros de ignominia\".\n\nLos pol\u00edticos civiles que quer\u00edan negociar la paz con los Aliados habr\u00edan podido ser detenidos y hasta asesinados de no haber sido por la incertidumbre que embargaba al emperador Hirohito en los \u00faltimos meses. Y ya hab\u00eda sido derrotado el nazismo. Jap\u00f3n estaba solo. El Ej\u00e9rcito nip\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n pretend\u00eda que la poblaci\u00f3n civil muriera con \u00e9l. Se form\u00f3 un Cuerpo Patri\u00f3tico de Lucha Ciudadana, muchos de cuyos miembros estar\u00edan armados con nada m\u00e1s que simples lanzas de bamb\u00fa. Otros se atar\u00edan al cuerpo cargas explosivas que har\u00edan detonar cuando se arrojaran sobre los tanques estadounidenses.\n\nEsa era la realidad. Estados Unidos ten\u00eda pocas elecciones. O desembarcaba en las islas que conforman Jap\u00f3n y perd\u00edan por lo menos a 200.000 hombres o los bombardeaban. Adem\u00e1s Estados Unidos quer\u00eda vengarse de las atrocidades y los cr\u00edmenes japoneses en todos los rincones de Asia que hab\u00edan ocupado. A los prisioneros norteamericanos que hab\u00edan combatido en Filipinas hasta ser derrotados los japoneses los humillaron, los mataron de hambre y los castigaron cruelmente. Los campos de concentraci\u00f3n que mantuvieron los japoneses es un cap\u00edtulo todav\u00eda poco divulgado. Tan lapidarios, tan asesinos como los campos de la muerte de los nazis.\n\nLa venganza norteamericana ya se hab\u00eda iniciado en 1944, cuando comenzaron a bombardear Jap\u00f3n desde las islas reconquistadas. La sede central de la reconquista, en manos, entre otros, de almirantes y del general MacArthur fue ubicada en Australia, que gan\u00f3 con ello incorporar a su econom\u00eda la tecnolog\u00eda de \u00faltima generaci\u00f3n y los adelantos cient\u00edficos formidables que tra\u00edan consigo las tropas aliadas. Los bombardeos se los preparaba como castigo ejemplar. Se arrojaron bombas incendiarias de napalm sobre Tokio y otras ciudades, pero Hiroshima no fue tocada. Como si hubiera sido preparada para una ocasi\u00f3n como la que se llev\u00f3 a cabo el 6 de agosto de 1945.\n\nNo hubo despu\u00e9s de ello un Tribunal estilo Nuremberg para juzgar los cr\u00edmenes de guerra. Pocos fueron ajusticiados (entre ellos, Tojo), pero rein\u00f3 m\u00e1s un clima de clemencia y se taparon las investigaciones sobre las locuras y asesinatos de los japoneses que se hab\u00edan iniciado en 1936 sobre China con matanzas colectivas.",
