Such emails therefore don't necessarily mean the tech giant is working alongside King.c com, the maker of Candy Crush, it's simply the protocol that takes place when a user files a claim against another developer.\n Advertisement\nThe trademark includes games and software, educational services, and, oddly enough, clothing.\n King.com is indeed asking other developers to remove their games, according to Gamezebo.  King did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and an Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n Laying claim to a word as common as candy is ruffling some feathers in the world of gaming developers, many of whom may not have the financial resources necessary to fight a trademark claim against a more established developer such as King.\n Benny Hsu, the developer behind All Candy Casino Slots - Jewels Craze Connect: Big Blast Mania Land, told Gamezebo he doesn't have the money to fight back.  \"I plan on changing the name if that is what I must do,\" he said.\n King claims that users play more than 30 billion games per month, and its top game, Candy Crush Saga, was the most-downloaded free game on iPhones and iPads in 2013.\n The filing was approved by the United States Patent and Trademark Office last week.\n Do you think a game developer should be able to trademark the word \"candy\"?

                    "body": "When you have an intellectual property - especially one that's worth millions of dollars - you want to protect it.  But can such protections ever go too far?  That's the question a lot of industry watchers are asking this morning, as developers far and wide whose games include the word 'candy' are getting emails from Apple on behalf of King, the makers of Candy Crush Saga.\n In a filing with the US trademark office dated February 6, 2013, King.com Limited registered claim to the word 'candy' as it pertains to video games and, strangely, clothing.  On January 15, 2014 the filing was approved.  And now, a mere five days later, reports are coming in from developers that they're being asked to remove their app (or prove that their game doesn't infringe upon the trademark).\n \"Lots of devs are frustrated cause it seems so ridiculous\" says Benny Hsu, the maker of All Candy Casino Slots - Jewel Craze Connect: Big Blast Mania Land.  Benny's game, which shares no similarities with King's properties aside from the word 'candy,' is one of a number of games that have been targeted by King.\n Hsu contacted Sophie Hallstrom, King's IP paralegal, to discuss the matter further.  Rather than the simple \"oops, our mistake\" that Benny was hoping for, he was given a very finite response.  \"Your use of CANDY SLOTS in your app icon uses our CANDY trade mark exactly, for identical goods, which amounts to trade mark infringement and is likely to lead to consumer confusion and damage to our brand,\" reads Hallstrom's reply.  \"The addition of only the descriptive term \"SLOTS\" does nothing to lessen the likelihood of confusion.\" \"\nSo how does a word like 'candy' get trademarked?  According to Martin Schwimmer, a partner at the IP legal firm Leeson Ellis (and the man behind The Trademark Blog), it's all about how strong a connection the claimant has to that mark when it comes to a particular good or service.  Think of Apple, for example.  Nobody is going to expect the electronics giant to lay claim over the fruit, but if someone were to try to market an electronic device under that name, you'd better believe their lawyers would swoop in.\n So the question then, is whether or not there's a strong enough connection between the word 'candy' and video games as it pertains to Candy Crush Saga.  According to the US Trademark Office, the answer is a bona fide yes.\n Still, holding a trademark and being able to enforce it are entirely different things.  Schwimmer is quick to point out the difference between suggestive marks and unique ones.  \"Someone can't plausibly claim that they came up with the term TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on their own.  An incredibly unique trademark like that is somewhat easy to protect.\" \" But something generic - a dictionary word like candy?  That can be a lot trickier.\n \"Suggestive marks are protectable, but the problem is that third parties can claim that they thought up their mark on their own.\" \" And in the case of something as generic as 'candy,' it doesn't seem that farfetched to think that a lot of developers may have.\n \"As to how far King can enforce its rights, it will be a function of how strong its mark has become, and how similar the third party name is.  It would likely be able to enforce its rights against marks that are connotatively, phonetically or visually similar, for games that are conceivably competitive,\" Schwimmer tells us.  \"King can't go after candy companies because candy companies don't use the term CANDY as a trademark - they use it to identify their product.\" \"\nIf you're a developer who has received one of these letters from King, Schwimmer's advice is simple: call a lawyer.  \"A trademark lawyer can be very useful in obtaining a coexistence agreement.  Often a trademark owner will accept a settlement in which the possibility of confusion is mitigated, perhaps because the developer will not expand into areas more directly competitive with the trademark owner.\" \"\nBut in an App Store littered with small indie developers, this is an option that seems out of reach for developers like Benny Hsu.  \"Myself and other indie developers don't have the money or resources to fight back...  I plan on changing the name if that is what I must do.\" \"\nWith Apple seemingly complicit in King's claims - the letter Tsu initially received came through the iTunes legal department - one can't help but wonder what the future of the App Store and suggestive trademarks might be.\n \"Last year I learned I couldn't use the word MEMORY because it was trademarked,\" said Hsu.  \"Now I wonder what other common words will be trademarked in the App Store.\" \"",

                    "body": "Candy Crush Saga is the most pervasive casual game phenomena since Angry Birds and it seems intent on crushing any potential competitors -- at least those that use the word \"candy\" in their titles.  King.com Limited registered claim with the US trademark office almost a year ago, to the word 'candy' as it pertains to video games (and clothing!) Well, last Wednesday, January 15, King's filing was approved and today there are reports that developers are receiving emails from Apple if their games contain the word \"candy\" in the title.  There is no report yet if any clothing makers have been contacted, but a quick look at the Zaraterez website shows that they are no longer offering Candy Crush as one of their leggings offerings.\n According to a report by Jim Squires in the GameZebo blog, a developer named Benny Hsu, who makes a game called All Candy Casino Slots - Jewel Craze Connect: Big Blast Mania Land (quite a keyword-stuffed mouthful!), got such an email from Apple.  \"Lots of devs are frustrated cause it seems so ridiculous,\" says Hsu.  Developers are being asked to remove their apps from the App Store or prove that their gams do not infringe upon the Candy Crush trademark.\n When Hsu contacted King.c com, expecting an apology for the mistake, their paralegal answered him, \"Your use of CANDY SLOTS in your app icon uses our CANDY trade mark exactly, for identical goods, which amounts to trade mark infringement and is likely to lead to consumer confusion and damage to our brand.  The addition of only the descriptive term 'SLOTS' does nothing to lessen the likelihood of confusion.\" \"\nCopycat apps are indeed a serious issue on the app stores and it is hard to guard against fakes, but the Candy Crush claim seems a bit broad.  Surely there are many games involving candy that are sufficiently differentiated from Candy Crush so as to not be deemed infringing.  Ironically, Candy Crush Saga is itself a knockoff of a hugely popular (and decade old) \"match-three\" game called Bejeweled.  But it is name recognition at question here, not originality.  One would think that Hasbro, the maker of that venerable children's board game (which does have video game versions) Candy Land, would already have this trademark sewed up.\n Games like Candy Crush Saga represent big money for Apple, so it is no wonder they are helping to enforce King's trademark efforts.  And it is good for developers of popular games to see that Apple is combating copycats.  But won't many more developers be turned off by this apparent land grab in keyword space?  What, no more \"birds,\" \"farms,\" \"words,\" \"rope,\" \"fruit,\" (or \"ninjas\")?  It seems to me that the notices should have been reserved for legitimate \"copycat\" games that are clearly playing on the popularity of Candy Crush and hoping to fool people into downloading their substandard app.\n This last point is where this all gets a little absurd.  Candy Crush Saga makes an estimated daily revenue of just shy of $1 million -- and it's a free game!  It makes that money by sucking players into its manipulative game play and offering to scratch the resulting itches for a price.  Someone might download a copycat game but they won't actually get sucked in unless it's actually a good game.  Meanwhile, Candy Crush itself is being investigated by the U.K. Office of Fair Trading to see if \"guidelines are needed to stop firms exploiting young users,\" not to mention the 25-55 year-old female target demographic that has gotten hooked.",

However, developer Benny Hsu says that the claim is \"ridiculous.\" \"\nVentureBeat asked Martin Schwimmer of The Trademark Blog about how such a term could be trademarked.  It's all about how strong a connection is to a service.  \"Think of Apple, for example.  Nobody is going to expect the electronics giant to lay claim over the fruit, but if someone were to try to market an electronic device under that name, you'd better believe their lawyers would swoop in,\" the site explained.  Arguably, Candy Crush Saga is so ubiquitous, that King can own the term \"candy\" when it pertains to games.\n Of course, with a game as popular as Candy Crush Saga, it's likely that there are legitimate copycats trying to capitalize on the success of King's game.  However, there will likely be other games caught in the crossfire.  The best course of action for affected devs is to fight back in court.  However, that's not a realistic option for many.  Hsu plans on changing the name because \"myself and other indie developers don't have the money or resources to fight back.\" \"",

Such emails therefore don't necessarily mean the tech giant is working alongside King; it's simply the protocol that takes place when a user files a claim against another developer.\n The trademark includes games and software, educational services, and, oddly enough, clothing.\n Gaming blog Gamezebo says that King Limited is indeed asking other developers to remove their games.  King did not immediately respond to Mashable's request for comment, and an Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\n Laying claim to a word as common as candy is ruffling some feathers in the world of gaming developers, many of whom may not have the financial resources necessary to fight a trademark claim against a more established developer like King.  Benny Hsu, the developer behind All Candy Casino Slots -- Jewels Craze Connect: Big Blast Mania Land, told Gamezebo that he doesn't have the money to fight back.  \"I plan on changing the name if that is what I must do,\" he said.\n King claims that users play more than 30 billion games per month, and its top game, Candy Crush Saga, was the most-downloaded free game on iPhones and iPads in 2013.",
