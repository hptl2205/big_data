News on Friday.  President Obama made a surprise visit to the White House press briefing room on Friday to make the official announcement of Jay Carney's departure from the Obama administration.  In Obama's statement, he said that Carney is one of his closest friends and praised him for his work as his press secretary.  The president said that he will continue to rely on Carney as an outsider.\n Obama briefly spoke about his new press secretary as well.  He said that Earnest is honest and full of integrity.  The president called him \"a straight shooter.\" \"\nAfter Obama made the announcement, Carney said that being Obama's press secretary has been an amazing experience, according to a USA Today report.  Carney also said that he will be staying on at the White House until mid-June.\n Carney is a former Washington bureau chief for Time magazine.  He has been the White House press secretary since 2011 when he replaced Robert Gibbs in the position.  During the first two years of President Obama's presidency, Carney was Vice President Joe Biden's communications director.\n Jay Carney's resignation was one of the Top 10 Political Predictions of 2014 by this political writer.  At the beginning of this year, it was stated that Jay Carney would quit his job in the White House rather than continue being the man who must face the press to defend the Obama administration and the president on a near-daily basis.  The prediction further stated that Jay Carney would announce his decision to leave the White House and quickly disappear from public view soon thereafter.  The president's announcement on Friday does not include the future of Carney who just turned 49 years old last week.  Carney was the nation's 29th Press Secretary and the second one in the Obama administration.",

Carney said the transition will take place around mid-June, but Earnest will take his place traveling next week on Obama's trip to Europe.\n Carney brought rare but practical experience to the job as a former reporter who once covered the White House for Time magazine.

Reporters applauded the announcement.  Earnest is a native of Kansas City, Missouri, and Obama noted he still roots for the hometown baseball team, the Royals, as the son of an athletic coach.\n \"As you know, his name describes his demeanor,\" Obama said.  \"Josh is an earnest guy and you can't find just a nicer individual even outside of Washington.\" \"\nObama also teased Earnest for providing the \"golden voice and dulcet tones\" as narrator of West Wing Week, a recap of White House events that can be seen on YouTube or the White House website.

He has been deeply involved in negotiations with the press corps over access to the president.\n It was Obama's second appearance in the briefing room Friday to announce a resignation, the first being under much more somber circumstances as Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki left under pressure due to widespread problems plaguing the agency's health care system.  Obama said Carney's job has put a strain on his family and the press secretary told him in April that he's been wrestling with the decision whether to leave for some time.\n Carney said he's made no decision yet on his next step but plans to take the summer off before starting a new job.

I'm excited by some of the possibilities but it has been an amazing experience working here, just so fulfilling, Carney added.\n Despite coming from the White House press corps himself, Mr Carney developed a sometimes contentious relationship with the news media, who at times pressed him to say more than he was willing to about the president's policies and decision-making.\n He has been described by some White House colleagues as one who brought \"rare but practical experience\" to the job as a former reporter who once covered the White House for Time magazine.\n He left journalism to become communications director for Vice President Joe Biden and subsequently moved over to serve as Obama's press secretary in 2011.\n REPORTER'S PERSPECTIVE\nPresident Obama said Friday that Mr Carney was very much at home as the Press Secretary.\n \"Every morning, he comes to this place with a reporter's perspective,\" he told reporters after interrupting Carney mid-sentence as he responded to a question on Ukraine in the Brady Press Briefing Room.  \"That's why, believe it or not, I think he will miss hanging out with you,\" Obama said of Mr Carney.\n Mr Carney will be replaced by the deputy press secretary, Josh Earnest.  President Obama called Carney's successor a person of \"sound judgment and great temperament.\" \"\nEarnest has worked for Mr. Obama since the 2008 campaign, standing in for Mr. Carney at times in the briefing room.\n Mr Obama, who said Carney had told him of the decision in April, said he would miss him dearly.  \"He is one of my closest friends here in Washington,\" he said adding that Carney's five and a half years as an administration spokesman \"placed a strain on my wife and two kids.\" \"\nCarney was the second person to serve in the position during the Obama presidency, having replaced Robert Gibbs.",

And no matter how tough the briefing is, I walk out of here having been glad to stand here.\" \"\nObama said that Carney had demonstrated good judgment and temperament and said he will continue to rely on his advice from outside the West Wing.

Carney said the transition will take place around mid-June, but Earnest will take his place traveling next week on Obama's trip to Europe.\n Carney brought rare but practical experience to the job as a former reporter who once covered the White House for Time magazine.  He left journalism to become communications director for Vice President Joe Biden and subsequently moved over to serve as Obama's press secretary in 2011.\n \"He comes to this place with a reporter's perspective,\" Obama told reporters after interrupting Carney midsentence as he responded to a question on Ukraine in the Brady Press Briefing Room.  \"That's why, believe it or not, I think he will miss hanging out with you.\" \"\nA key component of a White House press secretary's job is to regularly joust with reporters in an intense question-and-answer session.  Obama said he is putting the \"flak jacket\" for dealing with the press on another friend in Earnest, who has worked with Obama since he was his communications director for the Iowa caucuses in the 2008 campaign.\n The affable Earnest is well-liked within the White House press corps, and is seen as helpful.  Reporters applauded the announcement.  Earnest is a native of Kansas City, Missouri, and Obama noted he still roots for the hometown baseball team, the Royals, as the son of an athletic coach.\n \"As you know, his name describes his demeanor,\" Obama said.  \"Josh is an earnest guy and you can't find just a nicer individual even outside of Washington.\" \"\nObama also teased Earnest for providing the \"golden voice and dulcet tones\" as narrator of West Wing Week, a recap of White House events that can be seen on YouTube or the White House website.  Earnest told reporters he's \"grateful and excited and relishes the opportunity to spend the next couple of years with you.\" \"\nEarnest, 39, regularly conducts the briefing at the White House or aboard Air Force One when Carney is absent.  He has been deeply involved in negotiations with the press corps over access to the president.",

He has a good temperament, and he's got a good heart.  And I'm going to miss him a lot.\" \"\nThe two shared a hug as Obama left the stage and the briefing continued.  Carney will remain in his post until July.  Carney did not give a reason for stepping down, other than spending more time this summer with his family.  He did say that he approached the president about leaving in April.\n There have been intermittent rumors that Carney is interested in a diplomatic post, possibly in Russia.  But he has denied such claims.  At just three years at the post, Carney has served as press secretary longer than anyone else in the last two decades.  \"People say to me, 'You have the hardest job' or 'one of the hardest jobs' and I am not saying it is easy every day -- but I loved it,\" Carney said.\n So, what's next for Carney? \"Well, I might manage my son's band,\" he said.  (That band, Twenty20, recently released a music video).\n Earnest steps in after a long history with the president.  He served as Obama's communications director in Iowa during the 2008 presidential campaign.  \"His name describes his demeanor,\" Obama said of Earnest.  \"Josh is an earnest guy, and you can't find just a nicer individual, even outside of Washington.\" \"\nEarnest said Friday during the briefing that he has \"learned so much\" from his predecessor and looks forward to taking on the job.  \"I would welcome any questions from the podium at any time.\" \"\n\"And you expect us to believe that?\" a reporter said, drawing laughter from the group.\n Though Friday did not mark Carney's last briefing, he and the reporters shared warm exchanges.\n \"Every day I've been in here with you has been a privilege,\" Carney said -- to which a reporter responded, \"Every day?\"",

He has been on my team since day one.  For two years with the Vice President, and for the past three and half years as my press secretary.  It has obvious placed a strain on Claire his wife, and his two wonderful kids.\" \"\nThe president discussed Carney's decades long career in journalism before he came to the administration, and called Carney one of his closest friends, and a great adviser.  President Obama said that he will miss Carney a lot.  The president announced that Josh Earnest is the new press secretary.\n Earnest has been Jay Carney's top deputy and has been running briefings and gaggles on his own for the last few years.  Earnest is President Obama's third press secretary.  Robert Gibbs was in the hot seat before Carney, and Earnest is following Carney.\n Jay Carney said that there is no date set for his departure, but he will be gone by the second or third week of June.  Carney said that he hasn't made any decisions yet about the future, but it is a pretty safe guess that a book will be in his future, and he is likely to return to journalism in some fashion.\n This is a typical second term departure.  Carney like a lot of figures in the Obama administration has lasted longer than the norm.  It can't be understated how difficult the job of a press secretary is.  Years of dealing with the media and crisis situations would take a toll on anyone.\n Carney's departure is a sign that President Obama's time in office is quickly winding down.  The familiar faces of this historic administration are beginning to move on, and pretty soon President Obama's time in office will come to an end.",

Carney's announcement came on the heels of this morning's press conference in which Obama announced that Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Eric Shinseki was resigning over the Veterans medical care scheduling scandal, which has resulted in at least 40 deaths.  Some in the media have suggested that the timing of Jay Carney's announcement was a deliberate attempt to deflect news coverage of Shinseki's resignation.  However, the impact of Carney's resignation is minor in comparison and if indeed this was a calculated maneuver by the Obama administration, it will likely be unsuccessful.\n Carney was busy doing his job in the briefing room and in the middle of his answer on a question about the Ukraine Obama entered the room, interrupted him and made the seemingly surprise announcement that Carney was resigning.  Leading with an attempt at lightheartedness Obama said that one of Carney's favorite lines is \"I have no personnel announcements at this time\" and then let the press know that in fact, Obama did have what he termed as a bittersweet personnel announcement.\n Obama informed the press that Carney had come to him in April to let him know that he was thinking about \"moving on.\" \" Obama admitted that he was \"not thrilled to say the least\" about the news.  He went on to praise Carney for his skills as Press Secretary, indicated that Carney was one of his closest friends and that he would miss him.  He further praised Carney for his \"good heart\" and \"good temperament.\" \" He also acknowledged the \"strain\" that the job had put on Carney and his family and wished him time with them during the summer before Carney tackles whatever the future has in store for him.  Obama asked the press \"to please be kind\" to Carney on his \"farewell tour.\" \"\nCarney will continue in his role as White House Press Secretary until June.  Upon his departure, he will be replaced by White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Ernest who first worked with Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.  Obama described Ernest as living up to his name, that he is a man of integrity, honesty and a \"straight shooter.\" \" He also jokingly said that today the \"flak jacket\" was officially passed from Carney to Ernest.\n Although there has been speculation about Carney taking the currently available post of Ambassador to Russia, Carney shrugged the suggestion off.  He made it clear that his family will be grateful to \"have him back\" and that were he to take that post his family would not \"be happy with the outcome.\" \" As for Carney's sentiments about being the White House Press Secretary, he spoke of the fact that it had not all been \"pretty\" but that it had been an \"honor\" and \"joy\" for him.\n The timing of Carny's resignation announcement may have been a surprise but clearly he had already discussed his decision with President Obama.  Carney's professional or political future is as of yet unknown but upon reflection Carney spoke warmly of his time as Press Secretary and let the media in attendance know that no matter how tough the briefings were he had always walked out of the room glad to have been a part of them.",

Jay Carney, Press Secretary to the White House, is stepping down.  Carney is the 29th Press Secretary and the second to serve under Obama.\n \"He has been on my team since day one.  For two years with the Vice President and for the past three and half years as my Press Secretary,\" said Obama as he cut into Carney's briefing to make the heartfelt announcement that Carney would be resigning.  \"In April, Jay came to me in the Oval Office and said that he was thinking of moving on, and I was not thrilled, to say the least,\" said Obama, according to video footage provided by NBC.  \"But Jay has had to wrestle with this decision for quite some time.\" \" He discussed the strain his time at the White House undoubtedly placed on Carney's family, noting that his daughter is a fine pitcher, but that Carney hasn't been able to see enough of the games.\n \"Believe it or not,\" said Obama to the crowd of journalists, \"I actually think he will miss hanging out with all of you, including the guys in the front row.\" \" Audible in the background amidst laughter is, \"What about the people in the third row!?\"\n\"I'm literally picking my jaw up off of the ground,\" said Kristen Welker, NBC's White House correspondent, according to Mediabistro.  \"I was not expecting that.  The rest of the press corps, to my knowledge, didn't get a heads up about this.  It really was a surprise announcement.  That is rare at this White House, for the press corps to be surprised.\" \"\nObama called the soon-to-be former Press Secretary a close friend and adviser, saying he'd continue to depend on him for input, and praising him for his work, judgement, temperament, and heart.  \"Today, the flak jacket is officially passed to a new generation,\" said Obama.  Which begs the question: who?  According to Obama, \"somebody who is also a friend and adviser.\" \" Namely, Josh Earnest, who is presently the Deputy Press Secretary and Special Assistant to the President.\n Josh Earnest, according to Obama, is as earnest as his name -- emphasizing the Earnest's kindness and heart.  \"You can't find just a nicer individual, even outside of Washington ...  There's no task that was too small, no detail too unimportant for Josh to attend to.  At the White House, he's been a mentor to many of the young people here, who I know are thrilled for him today,\" said Obama, according to ABC.  He asked, jokingly, that the press \"be nice to Josh during his initiation,\" and said that while the press was likely to eventually \"get frustrated with him,\" they might even find that a little difficult \"because he's a straight shooter\" and such a \"great guy.\" \"\nEarnest has been with Obama on staff since 2007 as the Iowa communications director, following him to the capital after Obama won the election.  He narrates the White House Weekly video reports in what Obama describes as a \"golden voice and dulcet tones.\" \"\nWhen it comes time for him to take over for Carney, it will hardly be the first time Earnest has stood in front of the press; he's subbed in previously in Washington and while traveling with the President.  As the Deputy Press Secretary, it was Earnest's job to help prep Carney, so the process will hardly be new.  In a 2012 interview with McClatchy, Earnest described his work there.  \"Most evenings, the first 15 minutes of the network news is composed of challenges or problems or discoveries that have been worked on by someone at the White House that day.  This unique perspective is sometimes thrilling, sometimes frustrating, but most frequently, it's humbling.\" \"\nCarney described Earnest at the time as \"indispensable,\" saying that, \"I depend on his judgment all the time.\" \" In 2012, McClatchy referred to Earnest as \"a kid from south Kansas City.\" \" But Carney took the position at forty-six in 2011, now fast approaching fifty, while Earnest is nearly forty, and after all the article may have called him a kid, but it also called him a \"political veteran\" with a career comparable to a \"nonstop whirlwind.\" \"",

                    "body": "Jay Carney made no major blunders during his three pressure-packed years at the White House podium.\n He faced the fate of all press secretaries, having to deny the obvious, deflect the embarrassing and minimize the negative.\n ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd he undoubtedly felt burned out, wanting to spend more time with his two kids and make some private-sector dough.\n But the increasingly strained relations between Carney and the press corps were minimizing his effectiveness, to the point that a change made sense for the administration.  Carney announced his resignation on Friday, getting an awkward bear hug from the president.\n What brought a biting personal edge to the briefings was that Carney adopted the habit of suggesting that reporters such as Ed Henry and Jonathan Karl were being partisan, or carrying the Republicans' water, or mocking them for asking tough questions -- even though the questions were perfectly legitimate.\n Perhaps there was an extra layer of resentment because Carney had been one of them, a veteran Time magazine correspondent until he left journalism to become Joe Biden's spokesman in 2009.  And of course the televised briefings involve theater on both sides, with TV reporters looking for flashy exchanges they can replay on their networks.  But Carney went a step further, saying the correspondents would be \"disappointed\" that his answers didn't feed an anti-Obama narrative.\n Carney deflected blame for the toxic tone in an MSNBC interview this morning.  He said there was a \"theatricality\" to the briefings because of the cameras, and that some reporters ask the same question that has been repeatedly answered \"to get a crack at their moment on TV.\" \"\nCaught between the president and the press, Carney was often in the position of defending the indefensible.  The drumbeat of questions about whether the president had lost confidence in Eric Shinseki, when the White House was clearly preparing to shove him out the door, forced Carney to keep dodging.  Little did we know that his own resignation would be tacked onto the VA secretary's to create a one-day \"housecleaning\" story.\n Before that, Carney had to make the ludicrous argument that an e-mail about the Benghazi talking points that the administration had failed to give to Congress wasn't really about Benghazi.  And he was battered for months about the slow-motion disaster that was the ObamaCare rollout.\n Carney also insisted that the administration was living up to its promises on transparency, even as photographers were denied access to important events in favor of government-issued pictures and video.  He responded to criticism about access by listing Obama's record number of interviews, although many of those sessions were with the likes of Jay Leno, Jon Stewart, ESPN, Ellen DeGeneres or Zach Galifinakis.\n And it was Carney who took the heat when the Justice Department conducted surveillance of reporters at the AP and Fox's James Rosen, which had a chilling impact on investigative journalism.\n Carney, of course, didn't make most of these decisions, and there was criticism that he was not in the loop like his predecessor, Robert Gibbs.  Many reporters also complained that he was difficult to reach.\n Carney was the first straight reporter to take the job since NBC's Ron Nessen left NBC to be Gerald Ford's spokesman.  I always wondered whether he felt he had to demonstrate his loyalty by being just a little tougher on his ex-colleagues.\n Part of his job, of course, was to be the designated pi\u00f1ata for the press corps.  \"Under Carney, the press briefing further devolved into daily rounds of rope-a-dope, in which he appeared mostly interested in outlasting his antagonists,\" the New Republic says.\n But you can't score points when you're constantly on defense.  Carney, it seems, had lost the ability to drive a positive message.  Of course, his boss has had a bad year, and that didn't leave Jay much to work with.\n Carney's well-liked deputy, Josh Earnest, will now give it a shot (having beaten out State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki for the job).  It reminds me of when the genial Tony Snow replaced that embittered Scott McClellan in the Bush White House.\n As for Carney, he can go the corporate consulting route.  But with Gibbs and David Axelrod having blazed a path to MSNBC, I wouldn't be surprised to see him joining the pundit ranks.\n Click for more from Media Buzz.\n Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

Since it's Flashback Friday, we dug up another story about one of Earnest's career moves -- 12 years ago.\n Roll Call's Hill Climbers (still in existence today) profiles upwardly mobile young staffers working in the Capitol.  That's Earnest above in March 2002 with Rebecca Constantine.  The two of them had just won jobs in a House Democrat's office.\n President Barack Obama announced Friday he would be bidding farewell to Jay Carney, who will leave in June.\n \"One of Jay's favorite lines is I have no personnel announcements at this time,\" Obama said.  \"But I do, and it's bittersweet.  It involves one of my closest friends here in Washington.\" \"\nCarney told Obama in April he wanted out.\n \"I was not thrilled to say the least,\" Obama said.  \"But Jay has had to wrestle with this decision for quite some time.  He has been on my team since day one, for two years with the vice president, and for the past three and half years as my press secretary.\" \"\nCarney cited his family, tearing up when talking about missing time with his kids, and said that every day has been a privilege.\n He said he wanted to leave before the summer and said he had no announcements about his future plans.\n \"The flak jacket is officially passed to a new generation, Mr. Josh Earnest,\" Obama said.\n \"Josh is an earnest guy and you can't find just a nicer individual even outside of Washington.  The country, of course, knows him for his golden voice and dulcet tones on 'West Wing Week,' the biggest viral Internet hit since 'Between Two Ferns.' ' But Josh and I have an incredible history, going all the way back to the Iowa caucuses.  Josh was my Iowa communications director.\" \"\nIndeed, Earnest was considered one of the early Obama loyalists in his critical first victory state, and has remained at the White House longer than most of the others from the original team.  Carney replaced Robert Gibbs in 2011.\n Earnest briefly took the podium talking about the challenge of taking on the role.\n \"Each of you has a critically important job to describe to the American public what it is the president is doing and why he's doing it.  And that job in this aggregated media world has never been more difficult, but I would argue that it has never been more important.  And I am grateful and excited and relish the opportunity to spend the next couple of years working with you as you work to do that very important work,\" he said.",

                    "body": "Jay Carney, chief liar and shill for President Obama (otherwise known as \"The White House Press Secretary\"), seems to have finally reached the breaking point.  (What is so funny is that about a week ago, I was actually pondering how much longer would Carney last) ?  It's got to be tough being forced on a daily basis to tell lies.  To tell lies to cover up for other lies.  To spin, spin, spin so much so that you actually might forget what the truth was in the first place.  To make up idiotic responses and cover for \"The One\" while looking like a fool yourself.  It had to get to Carney.  And I believe it finally did.\n I do not think for one minute that Carney quit to have \"more family time\" as he suggests.  Maybe, unlike many in the Obama Adminstration and Obama himself, Carney might actually have a soul.  And he did not want to sell it to the devil.  He got fed up with being the main liar, dodger, the fall guy, the pajama boy for Barack Hussein Obama.\n Carney probably reached the point where enough is enough.\n So Carney is out.  As a fond farewell to the \"spokespud\" for Obama, I'd like to share a Yahoo interactive link (a bit dated, but still applicable) that demonstrates that Carney did his job well.  He avoided answering questions.  He deflected blame from his boss.  Heck, like Obama, he seems to \"know nothing\" about what goes on around him.  The link is called \"The top 9,486 ways Jay Carney won't answer your questions.\" \" It's an interactive site and you can play around with the various responses as you wish.  From the Yahoo site itself:\n\"Yahoo News analysis of the 444 briefings through June 18 that Carney has held since becoming White House press secretary has identified 13 distinct strains in the way he dodges reporters' questions.  Since Carney held his first daily briefing with reporters in the White House Brady Press Briefing Room on February 16, 2011, for example, he's used some variation of \"I don't have the answer\" more than 1,900 times.  In 1,383 cases he referred a question to someone else.  But will he at least speculate on hypotheticals?  No. In fact, he has refused to do so 525 times.\" \"\nIn the following interactive, you can browse all 9,486 of Carney's most-used responses and verbal crutches.\n Isn't it really sad that what was supposed to be \"the most transparent\" presidential administration has turned out to be the exact opposite?  With mouthpieces and puppets like Carney putting themselves out there to cover for The One and take the heat.  While The One - Barack Hussein Obama - continues to hide behind his minions, pretends to not know anything that is going on in his own administration until he learns about it on the news, and is oblivious to the damage he is doing to the country all while still using the excuse \"it's Bush's fault.\" \"\nCredit must be given to Carney if he finally had enough and threw up his hands, quitting in disgust.  No longer willing to be the fall guy for scandal after scandal after scandal.... However, if Jay Carney simply decided to resign to help divert attention away from the scandal-of-the-day: the VA (and we know how the Obama Administration loves to use diversions once misdeeds and illegal activities come to light), shame on him.  Either way, one puppet is gone.  As expected, another one will soon take his place.  One that can defend, lie, and bend over backwards to protect The One.  What has this nation become?  One where doing the right thing is pushed on the backburner in an effort to make a narcisstic president look good?",

He left journalism to join the White House as communications director for Vice President Joe Biden, and subsequently moved over to serve as Obama's press secretary in 2011.\n \"He comes to this place with a reporter's perspective,\" Obama told reporters after interrupting Carney mid-sentence at the beginning of Carney's daily news conference in the Brady Press Briefing Room.  \"That's why, believe it or not, I think he will miss hanging out with you.\" \"\nA key component of a White House press secretary's job is to regularly joust with reporters in an intense question-and-answer session.\n Obama said that Carney had demonstrated good judgment and temperament and said he will continue to rely on his advice from outside the West Wing.  The two men embraced before Obama made his exit.\n Obama said he is putting the \"flak jacket\" for dealing with the press on another friend in Earnest, who has worked with Obama since he was his communications director for the Iowa caucuses in the 2008 campaign.\n The affable Earnest is well-liked within the White House press corps, and reporters applauded the announcement.\n \"As you know, his name describes his demeanor,\" Obama said.  \"Josh is an earnest guy and you can't find just a nicer individual even outside of Washington.\" \"\nObama also teased Earnest for being the \"golden voice and dulcet tones\" that narrates West Wing Week, the weekly recap of White House events on YouTube.\n The president said Carney plans to take the summer off before getting a new job.\n Carney said he's made no decision yet on his next step, but is excited about some of the possibilities he's begun to explore.  He ruled out rumors that he would serve as ambassador to Russia, after having covered the collapse of the Soviet Empire for Time, saying his wife and two children wouldn't welcome such a move.\n Carney expressed his appreciation for working at the White House for five years, even though he says being press secretary is not easy.\n \"It's an important interaction that takes place here,\" Carney said.  \"It's not always pretty.  It could certainly be better.  But to be a part of it is an honor and a joy for me.  And no matter how tough the briefing is, I walk out of here having been glad to stand here.\" \"\n___\nFollow Nedra Pickler on Twitter at https://twitter.com/nedrapickler",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama's new spokesman is a son of Kansas City who will soon be one of the most visible faces of the U.S. government in the capital and around the world.\n \"Today the flak jacket is officially passed to a new generation, Mr. Josh Earnest,\" Obama said half-jokingly Friday in introducing his choice to be the new White House press secretary.\n The president named Earnest to replace Jay Carney, who announced that he was stepping down after 31/2 years of daily briefings, press conferences, thousands of miles of travel and the unpredictable whirlwind of the 24-hour news cycle.\n \"I am grateful and excited and relish the opportunity to spend the next couple of years working with you as you work to do that very important work,\" Earnest told reporters after being introduced by Obama.  \"And that job in this aggregated media world has never been more difficult, but I would argue that it has never been more important.\" \"\nAlready the top deputy to Carney, Earnest is the son of a psychologist mother and a private school athletic director father from Lee's Summit.\n He now moves into the center of the media storm in one of the most demanding jobs in Washington in terms of hours and portfolio.\n He'll have to be on top of worldwide current events, almost instinctively know what questions reporters might ask and serve as a traffic cop between a voracious adversarial media and a White House that relishes keeping its cards close to the vest.\n \"Every single day they're on the firing line, and reporters often have a huge number of different subjects that they want to ask about at the daily briefing,\" said Caren Bohan, who oversees White House and congressional coverage for Reuters and is a past president of the White House Correspondents' Association.\n \"The press secretary has to be up to speed on everything from foreign policy to the president's climate change initiative to the troubles at the Veterans Affairs agency,\" she said.  \"You can often find yourself on the defensive.\" \"\nAccording to the president, family and friends, Earnest is more than up to the task.\n \"Oh yeah.  Absolutely,\" Don Earnest, 65, said of his son.  Don Earnest is athletic director at Pembroke Hill School.  \"He's certainly excited about that opportunity.  Those opportunities are rare and pretty gratifying.\" \"\nAnd something that the younger Earnest has prepared for most of his adult life.\n After graduating from Rice University in 1997 with a degree in political science, he jumped into Democratic campaigns -- in Houston for former Mayor Lee Brown, New York for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Washington as a congressional aide and a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Florida for a governor's race.\n Finally, he landed in Iowa, working on then-Sen.  Obama's quest for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.\n \"He is of sound temperament,\" Obama said.  \"He is honest and full of integrity, and I'm sure you will at some point get frustrated with him as well.  But it's going to be hard because he's a straight shooter -- and a great guy.\" \"\nAdam Moore, a Kansas City lawyer who's known Earnest since grade school, agreed.\n \"He's been ready for a long time,\" said Moore, 39.  \"He is without a doubt one of the most honest, straightforward guys you'll ever meet.  ...  (He) will be a breath of fresh air in that press room.\" \"\nMoore warned the sharp-elbowed White House press corps not to expect a marshmallow at the podium.\n \"He's a lot tougher than it seems,\" he said.  \"He's somebody who will take his lumps and do it with a smile on his face.\" \"\nBohan described Earnest as \"very professional\" but said \"he will push back if he doesn't like the angle of your story or if he disagrees with the premise.\" \"\nEarnest is married to Natalie Wyeth, an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department.  They met at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.  They are expecting their first child.\n The couple married at the tony Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, nuptials noted in The New York Times.\n Earnest maintains strong Kansas City roots, cheering for the Royals.\n \"It's not easy, but I totally do,\" Earnest told McClatchy on Friday, adding that he'll \"take questions about the Royals from this podium any time.\" \"\nEarnest reads The Star's sports section daily, said a source, who in keeping with Washington's bound-up ways, would only say so on condition of anonymity.\n Earnest grew up in the Red Bridge area with two younger brothers.  He attended the private Barstow School on a scholarship and played for its baseball and basketball teams and belonged to the French and computer clubs.\n He started in politics straight from college.\n Earnest is \"indispensable,\" Carney said in a Star story in 2012.  \"I depend on his judgment all the time.  ...  His time in politics has made him smart, but not cynical.\" \"\nAs top deputy, Earnest occasionally subbed for Carney at the daily briefing for the White House press corps.\n In the 2012 story, Earnest said \"part of the job is ensuring that the president's point of view is being communicated.  Sometimes it's important for that message to be delivered forcefully, but professionally.\" \"\nCarney, a 21-year veteran of Time magazine, proved to be a fierce advocate for the administration -- first for Vice President Joe Biden, for whom he was communications director, and then for the president.\n Carney, 49, said he was leaving to devote more time to his family.\n Friends of Carney said he also wanted to return to the private sector for financial reasons.  He and his wife, Claire Shipman, a writer and part-time contributor to ABC News, have a 12-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, both in private school in Washington.",

                    "body": "President Obama on Friday announced that White House spokesman Jay Carney, point person for the press's pointed questions, is leaving his position.  As is the tradition for such departures, this is the time when we celebrate the moments of Carney's tenure that strayed the furthest from the dry I-don't-have-an-answer-to-that-question variety.\n Such as:\nIn April of last year, Carney was asked to respond to lyrics from a Jay-Z track in which the rapper suggested that the president might have authorized the rapper's controversial trip to Cuba.  (The lyrics: \"Boy from the hood but got White House clearance / ...  Obama said, chill, you gonna get me impeached / We don't need this [expletive] anyway, chill with me on the beach.\" \")\n\"I guess nothing rhymes with Treasury,\" Carney responded, \"because Treasury offers and gives licenses for travel, as you know, and the White House has nothing to do with it.\" \" Carney no doubt meant to say that \"Treasury clearance\" had a much worse rhythm to it than \"White House clearance,\" which is probably where the problem arose.\n Before he fielded questions for Obama, Carney was responsible for answering questions for Vice President Biden, almost certainly a much-trickier enterprise.\n In 2010, the New York Times reached out for comment about the Onion's parodies of the vice president.  Carney was not amused.\n \"Let me get this straight: You want to interview the vice president about stories about him in The Onion?\" Mr. Carney asked, sounding at once amused and dumbfounded by the request.  \"Well, I'll give you credit for trying.\" \"\nFeb. 15, 2012:\nQ: Jay, on a lighter note, is the President following at all the story of Jeremy Lin, the Knicks sensation -- \"Linsanity,\" that kind of seems to be catching the world by storm?  I understand the Chinese are very interested in him as well.\n MR. CARNEY: ... [H]e's very impressed and fully up to speed.\n April 4, 2014:\nQ: How far-reaching will this ban go or has there been a determination that there will be a ban officially on selfies with the President?  And what have been the conversations with Samsung and David Ortiz himself?\n MR. CARNEY: There's no discussion of a ban.  I think that was --\nQ: That's Dan Pfeiffer from yesterday.\n MR. CARNEY: He was saying, I think humorously that the end of all selfies -- and I don't think he just meant the White House.\n Q: So this a nationwide ban on selfies?  (Laughter.) )\nMR. CARNEY: We're going to use our executive authority to -- (laughter.) )\nFeb. 2, 2012: When asked about Donald Trump's endorsement of Mitt Romney in the presidential campaign, Carney replied, \"I'm not going to comb over that question.\" \"\nLast year, the folks at Yahoo's \"The Ticket\" put together an interactive that allowed readers to explore the nearly 10,000 ways in which Carney had demurred from answering media questions.  It's a list that includes \"I would refer you to someone else\" (used 1,383 times), \"I'm not going to tell you (939 times) and \"I won't speculate (525 times).\n You'll note that this list is now almost a year old.  Perhaps once Carney hit the 15,000-mark, he decided that he'd accomplished everything possible in the role.\n At a press briefing in April 2012, Carney criticized the assembled reporters' use of clich\u00e9s.  \"[I]t's your job to come up with clich\u00e9s -- 'game on,' and things like that,\" he said, according to the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, \"but I'm not going to engage in that.\" \"\nSo Lizza went back and tallied up Carney's clich\u00e9s from his days as a reporter at Time: \"Loyalty is a two-way street,\" \"you have only one chance to make a first impression,\" \"magic bullet.\" \"\nIn Carney's defense, that doesn't undermine the argument that reporters use too many clich\u00e9s.\n When Carney agreed to do a feel-good article for Washingtonian MOM magazine earlier this year, he probably assumed it was harmless enough.  Until a someone involved in the process of producing the article decided to bulk up his bookshelves, inadvertently Photoshopping Carney's kid's finger into multiple locations.\n For some reason, nothing got Carney national attention more rapidly than when he changed his appearance.  The guy grows a beard, he ends up in the fashion section of the New York Times.  Then he got new glasses, and that became a thing, too.  The Washington Post's Ned Martel describes the press room's first glimpse of the frames.\n After a middling attempt at humor (\"The better to see you with\") and flattery (\"You guys look great, actually\"), Carney settled on humility, pleading that his new square-rimmed, big-lensed, chunky-framed glasses were dictated by \"the ravages of age.\" \"\nNo luck.  \"But they're hipster,\" a reporter retorted.\n \"Really?\" Carney said.  \"I thought they were sort of retro-nerdy.\" \"\nCarney was right.  If you'd like to stay up to date on the retro-nerdy look, check out jaycarneysglasses.t tumblr.c com.  It isn't updated often.\n Just last weekend, Carney made headlines when he assumed the position of spokesman for another powerful organization: the band Guided By Voices.\n Which may give some insight into his next employer.  After all, his son's band just hit the big time.",

A number of other V.A. officials were also to be removed from their positions.  In a White House briefing, Obama vouched for Shinseki's character in emphatic terms, noting that he did not ask the former four-star general to resign.  (Later in the day, Carney cited Shinseki's \"unique goodness.\" \")\n\"He has worked hard to investigate and identify the problem,\" Obama said.  \"He does not want to be a distraction.\" \" Deputy Secretary of Veteran Affairs Sloan D. Gibson will take over as acting secretary.\n The more surprising departure of the week was that of Carney, who is remarkably well-liked, given the Obama administration's all-out war on leaks and the reporting on them.  President Obama popped into the daily White House press briefing unannounced to share the news of Carney's impending departure, which is not yet set for a particular date.  The president sang Carney's praises, and said the secretary would like to spend more time with his family.  Carney later joked that he might take up managing his son's band, \"which is just about to break out.\" \"\nJosh Earnest will take over Carney's duties.  \"The flack jacket moves on to a new generation,\" Obama said.  Earnest has worked for Obama since his first presidential campaign, and will be the administration's third press secretary.  (Carney succeeded Robert Gibbs\nCarney's resignation is as good a time as any to celebrate the outgoing press secretary's appreciation of Guided by Voices.  Just a few days ago, Carney introduced \"the greatest rock band in the world\" at a concert, and he has been known to mistakenly invoke members of the band when trying to describe Senate leadership.  And while the White House Press Corps is sometimes criticized for not taking an appropriately adversarial approach to covering the administration, the reporters who interact daily with Carney teased the secretary when he grew and eventually shaved his temporary beard, prompting Carney to acknowledge the \"insufficiency of my effort\" to grow facial hair.\n Though he thanked the president and endorse his successor, Josh Earnest, Carney largely declined the opportunity to wax poetic about his time as press secretary.  \"I'm sure we'll be seeing each other both in this room and elsewhere in the next couple of weeks and beyond,\" Carney said in response to a question from April Ryan.  \"I'll have a few things to say about the way that I view this job and this interaction, in the way it takes place here and in this town.  Hopefully some of the things I say will resonate somewhere, but I just don't think today is the day.\" \"\nThe president and Carney also shared this graceless hug:",

In addition to the burgeoning scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Earnest will be in charge of pushing the White House and broader Democratic agenda leading up to the midterm elections later this year.  Democrats are trying to avoid losing control of the Senate, which would put a major dent on Obama's plans for his final two years in office.\n Earnest currently serves as the administration's deputy press secretary and special assistant to the president.  When Carney takes a day off or is attending to other obligations, Earnest is usually the one to step in.\n After growing up in Kansas City and graduating from Rice University in 1997, Earnest immediately went to work in politics.  He worked on the 1997 mayoral campaign of Lee Brown, the first African-American mayor of Houston.\n He proceeded to work on former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's first campaign, according to a McClatchy profile published during the 2012 campaign.  He then served as a congressional aide to Rep.  Marion Berry, a former congressman from Arkansas.\n Earnest has been with Obama from the early moments his rise to become president.  He joined then-Sen.  Barack Obama's first White House bid in 2007 as its Iowa communications director.  Later, when Obama and then-Sen.  Hillary Clinton were still slogging it out in the Democratic primary, he served as the campaign's Texas communications director.\n In the McClatchy profile from 2012, Earnest said his primary focus was prepping Carney for his daily, hour-long sessions with the press.  Now, he'll be leading them.\n \"Most evenings, the first 15 minutes of the network news is composed of challenges or problems or discoveries that have been worked on by someone at the White House that day,\" Earnest said.  \"This unique perspective is sometimes thrilling, sometimes frustrating, but most frequently, it's humbling.\" \"",

He'll have to be on top of worldwide current events, almost instinctively know what questions reporters might ask, and serve as a traffic cop of sorts between a voracious adversarial media and a White House that relishes keeping its cards close to the vest.\n \"Every single day they're on the firing line, and reporters often have a huge number of different subjects that they want to ask about at the daily briefing,\" said Caren Bohan, who oversees White House and congressional coverage for Reuters and is a past president of the White House Correspondents' Association.\n \"The press secretary has to be up to speed on everything from foreign policy to the president's climate change initiative to the troubles at the veteran's affairs agency,\" she said.  \"You can often find yourself on the defensive.\" \"\nAccording to the President, family and friends, Earnest is more than up to the task.\n \"Oh yeah.  Absolutely,\" Don Earnest, 65, of Lee's Summit, Mo., said of his son.  \"He's certainly excited about that opportunity.  Those opportunities are rare and pretty gratifying.\" \"\nAnd something that the younger Earnest has prepared for most of his adult life.\n After graduating from Rice University in 1997 with a degree in political science, he started jumping into Democratic campaigns -- in Houston for former Mayor Lee Brown, New York for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Washington as a congressional aide and a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Florida for a governor's race.\n Finally, he landed in Iowa, working on then-Senator Obama's quest to upset Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination.\n \"Josh was my Iowa communications director, and even when he was in that role, you'd find him spending an extra hour or two helping young staffers make phone calls or knock on doors,\" Obama recalled Friday.\n \"At the White House, he's been a mentor to many of the young people here, who I know are thrilled for him today,\" Obama said.  \"He is of sound temperament.  He is honest and full of integrity, and I'm sure you will at some point get frustrated with him as well.  But it's going to be hard because he's a straight shooter -- and a great guy.\" \"\nAdam Moore, a Kansas City attorney who's known Earnest since grade school, agreed.\n \"It'll be a big change for him, but he's been ready for a long time,\" said Moore, 39.  \"He is without a doubt one of the most honest, straightforward guys you'll ever meet.  Which I think will be a breath of fresh air in that press room.\" \"\nMoore warned the sharp-elbowed White House press corps not to expect a marshmallow at the podium.\n \"He's a lot tougher than it seems,\" he said.  \"He's somebody who will take his lumps and do it with a smile on his face.\" \"\nBohan described Earnest as \"very professional\" but said \"he will push back if he doesn't like the angle of your story or if he disagrees with the premise.\" \"\nEarnest is married to Natalie Wyeth, an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Treasury Department.  They met at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.  They are expecting their first child.\n - William Douglas and Greg Gordon",

Bowe Bergdahl.  Members of Congress were informed after the fact.\n Amid growing questions about the deal on Monday, Carney said that Obama didn't have to notify Congress in advance because he had added a \"signing statement\" to the law that said the 30-day requirement infringed on the president's constitutional authority as commander in chief.\n \"In signing statements ... the president has consistently made clear that the executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detaining transfers if necessary,\" Carney said.  \"And that was certainly the case here.\" \"\nAs a presidential candidate in 2008, Obama criticized former President George W. Bush for using signing statements to flaunt the law.\n \"I believe in the Constitution, and I will obey the Constitution of the United States,\" Obama said at the time.  \"We're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end-run around Congress.\" \"\nCarney stressed on Monday that Obama had never taken the position that he opposed all signing statements.\n \"He made clear that there were times when it would be appropriate, but that the authority to issue signing statements should not be overused or abuse and that a president should exercises restraint,\" Carney said.\n \"And I think if you look at his record in office, now 5.5 years in office, you'll see that restraint demonstrated,\" he said.  \"But there will be and have been circumstances when signing statements are necessary because of the president's view and the executive branch's view of the constitutional issues involved in a particular legislation.\" \"\nObama has issued 28 signing statements in his six years in office, compared to 228 issued by George W.

                    "body": "LOS ANGELES, May 30, 2014 -- In one day, two members of the Obama administration experienced their final day on the job.\n In the morning, embattled Veterans's Affairs Chief General Eric Shinseki turned in his resignation.  In a more surprising move, White House Spokesperson Jay Carney stepped aside as well.\n Shinseki became a lightning rod when it was discovered that problems at the VA worsened on his watch.  President Obama spoke about fixing the VA before he ever became president.  The person he put in charge to fix the problems, despite being a respected military general, failed in this particular mission.\n The debate over Shinseki was not totally along party lines.  Senate Democrats in tough reelection races wanted him out.  Retired Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, a Fox News military analyst with a conservative bent, passionately defended Shinseki.\n Carney was another matter.  His job was to spin every piece of Obama straw into gold.  While this put him into ethical pretzels from time to time, he did his job with aplomb.  He was effective.\n The question of the timing could lead reasonable people to conclude that political motivations could be at work.\n President Obama has plenty of administration officials under various controversial clouds.  Attorney General Eric Holder in particular has kept his job in the face of various scandals.  Obama typically shows great reluctance to fire people who are loyal to him.  When people are thrown under the bus, it is when they become a political liability to him.  From Reverend Jeremiah Wright to Obama's \"typical white\" grandmother to Kathleen Sebelius, embarrassing President Obama personally seems to be the only qualification for falling out of favor.  On-the-job performance tends to be peripheral.\n As for Carney, he was not about to be indicted for anything.  He was doggedly loyal, and quite good at his job of defending the indefensible.  He could be burnt out.  Or, perhaps Obama needed a jolt of energy heading into the 2014 elections.  Current polls show Democrats facing a potential electoral bloodbath.\n Only President Obama knows if his actions regarding Shinseki and Carney were pure partisan politics.  The real issue is that such a strategy would not work.\n Shinseki and Carney have something in common with Sebelius and every other government employee.  They work for Barack Obama.  He hired them.  The bureaucracy did not fail him or let him down, as CNN stated.  He is the bureaucracy.  He runs it.  He did the hiring.\n The reason the Obama administration keeps being besieged by badly run departments still comes down to the criticisms leveled at Obama before he ever took office in 2009.  He had no experience running any government entity.  He had no experience with hiring, firing, or any other managerial functions.  He ran a campaign, but that is a completely different animal.\n He tends to let his ideological beliefs substitute empirical evidence.  Problems are not dealt with until the crisis becomes so big that it cannot be ignored.  Obama's government is slow, reactive and ineffective.  Obama ran on a campaign of change, but he stubbornly clings to the status quo until falling poll numbers force his hand.\n The departures of Shinseki and Carney may be apolitical, but the evidence based on Obama's history would suggest otherwise.\n There may be more changes, but until the man at the top making the decisions changes his own management style, the problems will not be stemmed by rapid employee turnover.",

                    "body": "Outgoing White House press secretary Jay Carney endured one of the toughest jobs in Washington during the roughest stretch of President Obama's time in office.  And he has seemingly built some currency for a variety of jobs that could offer the president's top spokesman influence and yes, money -- lots of it.\n But just who is the model for how to handle such a departure from the White House?\n Carney, the former Moscow bureau chief for Time magazine, on Monday ruled out the prospect of becoming the next U.S. ambassador to Russia.\n Most of his recent predecessors left 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. for a role in the public affairs sector, with varying degrees of success.  Others have written tell-all -- or more typically, tell-little -- memoirs.\n Robert Gibbs, Obama's first press secretary, launched a communications firm and is a political analyst on MSNBC.  Carney could likely follow suit if he so desired.\n Let's take a look at the best and worst transitions to the private sector by White House press secretaries over the last four decades -- and how their choices might influence Carney's decision.\n The Best James Brady\nJames Brady in 2011 (AP)Reagan's first press secretary, Brady was shot and paralyzed during the 1981 assassination attempt on the president.  Brady went on to have an enormous influence on politics despite retaining the press secretary title in name only.  The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence for decades has pushed for stricter firearms laws.  President Clinton ultimately signed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, and the White House briefing room is now named in Brady's honor.\n George Stephanopoulos\nStephanopoulos at Tulane University in 2009 (Photo: Tulane public relations)Stephanopoulos had a brief, unspectacular stint as Clinton's press secretary.  But after leaving the White House, he wrote a memoir that topped the New York Times Best Sellers list.  Then the former Clinton aide worked his way up at ABC News, ultimately hosting the network's Sunday news show and serving as a co-anchor on \"Good Morning America.\" \" His new deal with ABC reportedly pays him somewhere around $10 million annually, dwarfing his White House salary.\n Dana Perino\nPerino (Photo: Chris Greenberg/White House)Perino had no enviable task, taking over as press secretary just as George W. Bush became an unpopular lame duck.  Still, she parlayed her gig into a slot on Fox News' \"The Five.\" \" Perino spent three years on the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, appointed by Obama.  And she was also a book-publishing executive at Random House.\n Dee Dee Myers\nMyers (deedeemyers.o org)Her biggest claim to fame -- at least in this reporter's opinion -- is that she was the inspiration for C.J. Cregg on the television show \"The West Wing.\" \" In addition to serving as a consultant on that show, she co-hosted a news program on CNBC, wrote a book and became managing director of public affairs at the Glover Park Group.  In April, she was hired as head of corporate communications for Warner Bros.\n Jerald terHorst\nterHorst, who died in 2010 (C-SPAN.o org)Really, terHorst had no chance to use the press secretary position as a springboard for a lucrative job.  He resigned after one month as press secretary, furious over President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon.  Still, the public applauded the longtime newsman's decision, and he has since been regarded as arguably the most principled White House press secretary.  He later took a job as director of public affairs for Ford Motor Co.\nThe Worst Larry Speakes\nLarry Speakes, left, seen here with Reagan, died earlier this year.  (AP)The Reagan press secretary is the case study for what not to do after leaving the White House media shop.  Speakes admitted in his memoir that he gave reporters phony quotes attributed to Reagan.  The uproar over the book cost him a job as senior vice president for communications at Merrill Lynch & Co.\nScott McClellan\nMcClellan (White House photo) George W. Bush's second press secretary also encountered problems in the wake of penning a memoir.  After giving a surprisingly critical portrait of the president and senior Bush officials in his book, McClellan effectively alienated many of his former colleagues -- as well as potential employers in Washington.  Even some Democrats dismissed McClellan as an opportunist trying to sell books.  He later landed a job as the vice president of communications at Seattle University.\n Ron Ziegler\nZiegler died in 2003.  (White House photo)The plus side of serving as Richard Nixon's press secretary during the height of Watergate?  Clients know you can handle problems.  Your mug also ends up in a movie (see \"All the President's Men\").  The negative?  People might not want your name associated with their brand.  Ziegler later worked at Washington consulting firm Syska and Hennessy and became president of the National Association of Truck Stop Operators and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.",

It's good so far,\" said Carney, who was picked by the Chicago Bulls in the 2006 Rookie Draft and played for four different teams.\n Carney is averaging 20.5 points and 4.5 rebounds after TNT defeated Rain or Shine (83-81) and San Miguel Beer (103-97).\n Against the Beermen, Carney finished with 28 points and got big help from Jayson Castro, who scattered 21 points, and Jimmy Alapag, who added 18 markers, including 12 in the last period.\n The Tropang Texters shot 14-of-33 triples, with Alapag converting five.\n TNT will face an Air21 side that is also on a hot streak.  The two teams are also tied at 3-1.\n The winner of today's game could jump into a share for first place if defending champion San Mig Super Coffee beats rival Barangay Ginebra San Miguel in their game being played at presstime.\n Ginebra won its first three games of the season-ending conference while San Mig is at 3-1 entering yesterday's marquee duel.\n Air21 is coming off a 91-88 victory over Alaska last Friday, and Talk 'N Text coach Norman Black has cautioned his team to play relentless against \"a very dangerous team\".\n \"Air21 has been playing well so it will be a difficult,\" said Black.  \"It's a big game for both teams as it will keep the winner within the top four spots.\" \"\nBlack said they have to be a little precise in their offense, especially that Carney is still learning the system.  But far more importantly, TNT needs to limit the production of Air21 import Dominique Sutton and 41-year-old veteran Asi Taulava.\n \"We have to try and slow down the ageless Asi Taulava and their import Sutton,\" Black said, adding that their defense will also focus on Air21's scorers Joseph Yeo and Mac Cardona.\n Sutton is averaging 23.3 points and 13.8 rebounds per game, while Taulava is backing him up with 16.3 points with 13.3 boards.

As\u00ed fue hasta que, en medio de una pregunta sobre Ucrania, el presidente Barack Obama apareci\u00f3 en el podio y le interrumpi\u00f3: \"Es una de las frases favoritas de Jay, pero yo s\u00ed tengo un anuncio y es agridulce\".\n Con este peque\u00f1o show, Obama sorprendi\u00f3 con la dimisi\u00f3n de Carney.  El n\u00famero dos de comunicaci\u00f3n, Josh Earnest, ser\u00e1 el nuevo representante del presidente, el tercero desde 2009.\n Carney llevaba m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os en el cargo, desde que en febrero de 2011 sustituy\u00f3 a Robert Gibbs.  El periodista de 49 a\u00f1os fue reportero durante dos d\u00e9cadas en la revista 'Time' y empez\u00f3 en la Casa Blanca como jefe de comunicaci\u00f3n del vicepresidente Joe Biden.\n Aunque en circunstancias muy diferentes, fue el segundo anuncio de dimisi\u00f3n en dos horas, despu\u00e9s de la salida del secretario de los asuntos de los veteranos, Eric Shinseki, por la falsificaci\u00f3n de listas de espera para la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica de los militares.\n Johs Earnest , el nuevo portavoz\n\"Le voy a echar mucho de menos\", dijo Obama sobre Carney, descrito por el presidente como un \"amigo cercano\" y un \"gran consejero\".  El presidente explic\u00f3 que el portavoz le inform\u00f3 en abril de que estaba listo para dejar su puesto y cambiar de trabajo.\n Este viernes Carney no quiso aclarar cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 su futuro, aunque neg\u00f3 que vaya a ser nombrado embajador en Mosc\u00fa, una de sus opciones.  El portavoz habla ruso y fue corresponsal all\u00ed para 'Time'.  \"Estoy emocionado con algunas de las posibilidades\", dijo.\n Carney, en principio, se quedar\u00e1 hasta mediados de junio.  No dio detalles sobre sus motivos para dejar el cargo y dijo haber disfrutado con \"la incre\u00edble experiencia\" pese a que le han tocado los a\u00f1os m\u00e1s impopulares de Obama y ha tenido en ocasiones una relaci\u00f3n tensa con la prensa.  La ex directora de 'New York Times', Jill Abramson, dice que \u00e9sta es la Administraci\u00f3n \"m\u00e1s secretista\" que ha conocido.\n A menudo los reporteros acorralaban al portavoz quej\u00e1ndose de que no contestaba a las preguntas de manera clara.\n Obama deja su imagen en manos de un fiel conocido.  Earnest, de 39 a\u00f1os, trabaj\u00f3 en la campa\u00f1a a la alcald\u00eda de Nueva York de Michael Bloomberg y est\u00e1 con Obama desde el principio de su carrera presidencial.  Empez\u00f3 como portavoz del entonces senador en Iowa y en Texas durante las primarias de 2008.\n \"Josh y yo tenemos una historia muy larga desde los caucus de Iowa\", dijo Obama.  Seg\u00fan el presidente, es \"un tirador directo\".  Earnest ser\u00e1 el encargado de la prensa en el viaje a Europa de Obama la semana pr\u00f3xima.  \"S\u00e9 que en alg\u00fan momento os sentir\u00e9is frustrados con Josh tambi\u00e9n\", dijo a los reporteros, que aplaudieron el ascenso del segundo.\n El nuevo portavoz se enfrenta ahora a la recta final de la Presidencia Obama con una agenda internacional marcada por las crisis de Ucrania y Siria y el intento de repliegue en Afganist\u00e1n y una lista de reformas nacionales paralizadas, como la legalizaci\u00f3n de inmigrantes o la subida del salario m\u00ednimo.  Earnest vivi\u00f3 el ascenso emocionante de Obama, pero ahora le toca representarlo durante el declive.  Seg\u00fan la encuesta de Gallup actualizada a diario, el 51% de los ciudadanos critican la gesti\u00f3n del presidente frente al 45% que la aprueba.  Carney dijo que un buen portavoz disfruta hasta en los peores d\u00edas: \"Por muy duro que sea la rueda de prensa, salgo aqu\u00ed contento de estar aqu\u00ed de pie\".",

                    "body": "Total sorpresa cuando durante la rueda de prensa habitual de la Casa Blanca ha irrumpido hoy el presidente Barack Obama para anunciar la marcha de su portavoz, Jay Carney.  \"Seguir\u00e9 confiando en \u00e9l como amigo y asesor cuando tras un verano dedicado a disfrutar de sus hijos decida qu\u00e9 va a hacer a continuaci\u00f3n\", dijo el mandatario al anunciar la partida de Carney.  Apenas hab\u00edan pasado tres horas desde que el presidente comunicaba la decisi\u00f3n de aceptar la dimisi\u00f3n del jefe del Departamento de Servicios de Veteranos cuando Obama dec\u00eda adi\u00f3s a otro miembro de su gabinete.\n Las razones de la salida de Carney, 49 a\u00f1os, son de car\u00e1cter personal, relacionadas con el agotamiento propio de un cargo dise\u00f1ado para la pelea diaria con la combatiente prensa norteamericana.  No en vano Obama utiliz\u00f3 un t\u00e9rmino relacionado con el combate cuando anunci\u00f3 el nombre del sucesor de Carney en el cargo.  Para el presidente, Josh Earnest, 39 a\u00f1os, hasta el momento mano derecha de Carney, no solo es \"un gran tipo\" que forma parte de su equipo desde 2008 sino el s\u00edmbolo de que \"el chaleco antibalas\" pasa \"oficialmente a una nueva generaci\u00f3n\".\n Carney luc\u00eda rostro feliz, casi de alivio, cuando pronunci\u00f3 sus palabras de despedida y dijo que dejaba atr\u00e1s \"una fant\u00e1stica experiencia\" de m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os.  Calific\u00f3 como un honor ser portavoz de la Casa Blanca y no despej\u00f3 las dudas que de repente surgieron sobre cual ser\u00e1 su siguiente destino laboral.  A pesar de lo sorpresivo del anuncio y de que no hab\u00eda psitas al respecto, la partida del portavoz podr\u00eda decirse que tiene un periodo de caducidad natural que no debe superar los tres a\u00f1os, debido a la dureza del cargo y los rigores impuestos por la inmediatez de la informaci\u00f3n y la retransmisi\u00f3n televisiva de una rueda de prensa diaria.\n Tras m\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os de labor period\u00edstica en la revista TIME y al servicio del vicepresidente Joe Biden desde el comienzo de la Administraci\u00f3n Obama, Carney llegaba al podio de la Casa Blanca en febrero de 2011 para sustituir a un hombre de perfil muy diferente al suyo.  Robert Gibbs hab\u00eda sido \u00edntimo colaborador de Obama, siempre al lado del presidente, desde el momento en que la Casa Blanca era todav\u00eda un proyecto para el joven senador por Illinois.\n Obama reconoc\u00eda hoy que Carney llevaba tiempo \"luchando\" con la decisi\u00f3n que acababa de anunciar, ya que el puesto demandaba todo su tiempo y se lo robaba a su esposa Claire y sus hijos Hugo y Della.  \"Tiene buen juicio, buen temperamento y buen coraz\u00f3n.  Le voy a echar mucho de menos\", concluy\u00f3 el presidente.\n Carney no viajar\u00e1 con Obama la semana que viene a Europa, en una gira de cuatro d\u00edas que llevar\u00e1 al mandatario a Polonia, B\u00e9lgica y Francia.  Ser\u00e1 Earnest quien asistir\u00e1 a los periodistas que siguen al presidente, trabajo al que no es ajeno ya que lo desarrollaba ahora en ausencia de Carney.",
