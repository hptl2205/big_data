And there he was instead nailed to a cross.  Why had it happened?\n One of his friends had betrayed him.  The religious leaders of the time were jealous of him and were determined to have him killed.  A crowd which could have freed Jesus, decided not to.  The Roman governor was too weak to stand up for what he knew was right.  All these factors played a part in Jesus' death.  On Friday Jesus was laid to rest in Joseph's tomb.  On the Saturday, no doubt Jesus' disciples wondered what was going to happen next.  Would they end up being arrested too?  How would they spend the rest of their lives?\n And then on the Sunday morning they received the good news.  Some of the women followers who had been to the tomb had discovered that the stone at the entrance had been rolled away.  The tomb was empty.  Jesus was no longer there.  And one of the women, Mary Magdalene, reported to the disciples that she had seen Jesus alive!  Later on Jesus appeared to most of his disciples.  Immediately it was all change.  Their sadness turned to joy.  They knew that with Jesus' resurrection, death was no longer something for them to be afraid of.  They knew that if they believed and had faith in Jesus, then there would be a life beyond the grave for them.  What could be a more exciting piece of news to receive than that?  I hope that you have a very happy Easter.",

                    "body": "Well, it's Easter time, and that means that the mainstream media and publishing houses can be counted upon to issue de-bunking attacks on orthodox Christianity.\n The best-publicized of these is Bart Ehrman's How Jesus Became God.  Many by now know at least the outlines of Ehrman's biography: once a devout Bible-believing evangelical Christian, trained at Wheaton College, the alma mater of Billy Graham, he saw the light and became an agnostic scholar and is now on a mission to undermine the fundamental assumptions of Christianity.\n In this most recent tome, Ehrman lays out what is actually a very old thesis, going back at least to the 18th century and repeated ad nauseam in skeptical circles ever since, namely, that Jesus was a simple itinerant preacher who never claimed to be divine and whose \"resurrection\" was in fact an invention of his disciples who experienced hallucinations of their master after his death.  Of course Ehrman, like so many of his skeptical colleagues across the centuries, breathlessly presents this thesis as though he has made a brilliant discovery.\n But basically, it's the same old story.  When I was a teenager, I read British Biblical scholar Hugh Schonfield's Passover Plot, which lays out the same narrative, and just a few months ago, I read Reza Aslan's Zealot, which pursues a very similar line, and I'm sure next Christmas or Easter I will read still another iteration of the theory.\n And so, once more into the breach.  Ehrman's major argument for the thesis that Jesus did not consider himself divine is that explicit statements of Jesus's divine identity can be found only in the later fourth Gospel of John, whereas the three Synoptic Gospels, earlier and thus presumably more historically reliable, do not feature such statements from Jesus himself or the Gospel writers.  This is so much nonsense.  It is indeed the case that the most direct affirmations of divinity are found in John -- \"I and the Father are one;\" \"before Abraham was I am;\" \"He who sees me sees the Father,\" etc.\n But equally clear statements of divinity are on clear display in the Synoptics, provided we know how to decipher a different semiotic system.\n For example, in Mark's Gospel, we hear that as the apostolic band is making its way toward Jerusalem with Jesus, \"they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid\" (Mk.  10:32).  Awe and terror are the typical reactions to the presence of Yahweh in the Old Testament.  Similarly, when Matthew reports that Jesus, at the beginning of the last week of his earthly life, approached Jerusalem from the east, by way of Bethpage and Bethany and the Mount of Olives, he is implicitly affirming Ezekiel's prophecy that the glory of the Lord, which had departed from his temple, would return from the east, by way of the Mount of Olives.  In Mark's Gospel, Jesus addresses the crippled man who had been lowered through the roof of Peter's house, saying, \"My son, your sins are forgiven,\" to which the bystanders respond, \"Who does this man think he is?  Only God can forgive sins.\" \" What is implied there is a Christology as high as anything in John's Gospel.\n And affirmations of divinity on the lips of Jesus himself positively abound in the Synoptics.  When he says, in Matthew's Gospel, \"He who does not love me more than his mother or father is not worthy of me,\" he is implying that he himself is the greatest possible good.  When in Luke's Gospel, he says, \"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away,\" he is identifying himself with the very Word of God.  When he says in Matthew's Gospel, in reference to himself, \"But I tell you, something greater than the Temple is here,\" he is affirming unambiguously that he is divine, since for first century Jews, only Yahweh himself would be greater than the Jerusalem Temple.  Perhaps most remarkably, when he says, almost as a tossed-off aside at the commencement of the Sermon on the Mount, \"You have heard it said, but I say...\" he is claiming superiority to the Torah, which was the highest possible authority for first century Jews.  But the only one superior to the Torah would be the author of the Torah, namely God himself.\n Obviously examples such as these from the Synoptic authors could be multiplied indefinitely.  The point is that the sharp demarcation between the supposedly \"high\" Christology of John and the \"low\" Christology of the Synoptics, upon which the Ehrman thesis depends, is simply wrong-headed.\n And now to the \"hallucinations.\" \" Most of the skeptical critics of Christianity subscribe to some version of David Hume's account of the miraculous.  Hume said that since no reasonable person could possibly believe in miracles, those who claimed to have experienced a miracle must be unreasonable.  They must, then, be delusional or na\u00efve or superstitious.  Hume's logic was circular and unconvincing in the eighteenth century, and it hasn't improved with age.  Yes, if we assume that miracles are impossible, then those who report them are, to some degree, insane.  But what if we don't make things easy for ourselves and assume the very proposition we are trying to prove?  What if we keep an open mind and assume that miracles are, though rare, possible?  Then we don't have to presume without argument that those who claim to have experienced them are delusional, and we can look at their reports with unjaundiced eyes.\n What do we find when we turn to the resurrection appearance accounts in the New Testament?  We find reports of many different people who experienced Jesus alive after his death and burial: Peter, John, Mary Magdalene, the twelve, \"five hundred brothers at once,\" and Paul.  Does it strike you as reasonable that all of these people, on different occasions, were having hallucinations of the same person?  The case of Paul is especially instructive.  Ehrman argued that the visions of the risen Jesus were created in the anxious brains of his grief-stricken disciples, eager to commune once more with their dead Master.  But Paul wasn't grieving for Jesus at all; in fact, he was actively persecuting Jesus' followers.  He didn't crave communion with a dead Master; he was trying to stamp out the memory of someone he took to be a pernicious betrayer of Judaism.  And yet, his experience of the risen Jesus was so powerful that it utterly transformed his life, and he went to his death defending the objectivity of it.\n Debunkers of orthodox Christianity have been around for a long time.  In some ways, it is testimony to the enduring power of the Christian faith that the nay-sayers feel obliged to repeat their tired arguments over and over.  Faithful believers have simply to declare their Christianity with confidence and, patiently but firmly, tell the critics that they're wrong.",

                    "body": "The other day I stood in line at my local coffee house.  I was in a curious mood and just watched the four or five people in front of me as we stood in this unusually slow line.  Their body language and facial expressions said it all.  There were hands on the hips expressing disgust at the current inconvenience, some were rolling their eyes as they glanced up momentarily from texting on their cell phone and here was the predictable looking at the watch and then looking at the line and then looking back at the watch.\n Most of us do not like waiting for anything.  We live in a day of fast everything and waiting for anything seems like a major inconvenience.  I must confess I don't like waiting either.  I don't like standing in line for my favorite cup of coffee, flipping though magazines in the waiting room of the doctor's office and I sure don't like waiting in traffic.  And if I can just be honest with you, I don't like waiting on God either.\n Lewis Smedes described waiting like this: \"Waiting is our destiny.  As creatures who cannot by themselves bring about what they hope for, we wait in the darkness for a flame we cannot light.  We wait in fear for a happy ending that we cannot write.  We wait for a 'not yet' that feels like a 'not ever.' '\"\nThis is what we often see in the anatomy of hope and I talked a little bit about this in my last book \"Let Hope In\" .  There is an event that takes place that sucks the life out of you.  Something goes horribly wrong:\nYou're left there standing, waiting, paralyzed by hopelessness.  You start to wonder...\n Does God care?\n Luke 23:44-49 44 It was about noon, and the whole land became dark until three o'clock in the afternoon, 45 because the sun did not shine.  The curtain in the Temple was torn in two.  46 Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Father, I give you my life.\" \" After Jesus said this, he died.\n 47 When the army officer there saw what happened, he praised God, saying, \"Surely this was a good man!\"\n48 When all the people who had gathered there to watch saw what happened, they returned home, beating their chests because they were so sad.  49 But those who were close friends of Jesus, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance and watched.\n Notice how Jesus' closest followers react.  The gospel account says they \"stood at a distance and watched.\" \"\nHave you ever been so hopeless you couldn't do a thing?  You couldn't get mad or fight or even cry?  Have you ever felt so hopeless you didn't have the energy or passion to even get ticked off?\n I believe this is the emotional state of Jesus' followers.  Nothing seems to be happening.  They feel hopeless, as if they're completely alone.\n Now, we know the end of this story.  We know that God was in fact doing his best work yet.  But there would be a waiting period.\n It was Friday, remember, when Jesus was crucified.  But the paralyzing hopelessness the disciples experienced continued to intensify as they moved into Saturday.\n I think it's interesting that we don't talk a lot about Saturday in the church.  We spend a lot of time talking about Good Friday, which of course we should.  This is the day redemption happened through the shedding of Christ's blood.  It's a very important day.\n Nobody would argue that Easter Sunday is a day of celebration.  We celebrate that Jesus conquered death so that we can have life.  It doesn't get any better than Easter Sunday.\n But we don't hear a lot about Saturday do we?  Saturday seems like a day when nothing is happening.  In reality, it's a day of a whole lot questioning, doubting, wondering, and definitely waiting -- a day of helplessness and hopelessness.  It's a day when we begin to wonder if God is asleep at the wheel or simply powerless to do anything our about our current problems.\n While we don't spend a lot of time talking about Saturday, I think so much of our life here on this earth is lived out feeling somewhat trapped in \"Saturday.\" \" I'm trying to get to a place in my life where I can embrace \"Saturday.\" \" I'm trying to get to a place where I can view it as a type of preparation for what I believe God might be doing in my life.\n You may currently be in the midst of a horrible, out-of-control situation.  You feel as if God is not there, that there's nothing that can be done.\n But here is the message of the gospel for you while you're stuck in your helpless, hopeless Saturday life: God does his best work in hopeless situations.\n We worship a God who specializes in resurrections.  He specializes in hopeless situations.  After all, at Easter, we celebrate the fact that he conquered death -- the ultimate hopeless situation -- so you could have life.\n His followers were dejected and dismal and hopeless -- and then Jesus rose from the dead.  God did the impossible and in a matter of hours the disciples journeyed from hopeless to hope-filled; from powerless to powerful.  They saw him risen and everything changed.  The story of our salvation was born out of extraordinary uncertainty.  But that's the way hope works.\n And no, that doesn't take away your cancer.\n That doesn't erase the bankruptcy you're in the midst of.\n But it can remind you that while life is uncertain, God is not.  While our power is limited, God is limitless.  While our hope is fragile, God himself is hope.\n Your world may feel chaotic, especially when you're stuck in a Saturday struggling hopelessly and waiting desperately.\n But no doubt about it, God is still in control.  And one way or another, Sunday will dawn.",

For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, the unknown El.  Whom therefore you ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  Elohim that finishes the Cosmos and all things therein, thus heaven and earth, Yahweh dwells not in temples made with hands, neither is worshiped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life, and breath, and all things, and has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation, seeking Yahweh, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us, within him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, for we are also offspring, as offspring of Elohim, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, or graven art and man's device, and the times of this ignorance Elohim winks at, thus truly now commanding all men every where to repent, because of the appointed a day, in the which he will judge the Cosmos in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance unto all men, in that he was raised from the dead.\n \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u0300\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u0300 \u03bf\u0314

written accurately here in the Holy Hebrew Jewish Torah, but was deliberately mistranslated by the Greek and Latin Maccabees into every language on Earth, as they laid in wait to try to kill me, as soon as I birth, so that they could try to steal my inheritance for themselves, and set up and rob and murder my children of Israel, the children of Jacob, my children of Sarah, and my children of Ishmael, my children of Hagar, and my children of my sons of Keturah, and my children of the Gentiles, as the people waited for me Baal Joseph, the Prophet like unto Moses named Elohim, to come down from Horeb, my Mountain of the everlasting hills of Joseph, named after me, the Mountain of Elohim, as the Elohim the Father of my son from the womb of the virgin of the house of David, my son Jesus my Prophet like unto Aaron, and the people of Israel that failed to believe concerning me, the Prophet like unto Moses named Elohim, the people who erred, turned unto my Son Jesus, my Prophet like unto Aaron, made a Molten Calf of me, called Elohim, also called the Calf of Samaria, foretelling of me, the promised good Samaritan from my Capital City of my Northern Kingdom of Israel, and they worship the works of the their own hands in their heats, that Idol of their hearts have blinded their hearts, from acquainting the Holy Spirit, my Father El Highest, possessor of Heave and Earth, that planted my seed within the womb of the virgin of the house of David, my Father Holy Spirit making me Elohim the Father of my Son Jesus, and those who repent not, their males are the evil men of Belial espoused unto Baal Peor, the false Prophet of the Maccabees who worship me, the Elohim, instead of our Holy Creator, Holy named Yahweh who foretold of both me the Father named Elohim, and of my Son Jesus, and if they cast off any of us three Yah, us three El, us three Lords, our Maker Yah El Lord Yahweh, and me Yah El Lord Joseph the Elohim and Father of my Son, Yah El Lord Jesus, they will perish before me,\nAnd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us Elohim , which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.  And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.  And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your Elohim, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.  And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to Yahweh.  And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.  And Yahweh said unto Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: They have turned aside quickly out of the path which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your Elohim, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.\n The wedding that a certain King of Adam, made for his son",

(EUROPA PRESS) -\nEl Papa Francisco ha pedido a los cat\u00f3licos durante su audiencia general de este mi\u00e9rcoles en la Plaza de San Pedro que \"no bajen de la cruz antes de tiempo\" y que besen mucho el crucifijo durante esta Semana Santa, porque la resurrecci\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas \"no es el 'happy end' de una pel\u00edcula sino la prueba de que Dios act\u00faa en el momento m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, m\u00e1s oscuro\".\n \"Dios siempre interviene en el momento en que quiz\u00e1 uno no lo espera, y Jes\u00fas resucita.

No obstante, ha aclarado que \"su Pasi\u00f3n no ocurre por error\" sino que es \"una manera de mostrar su amor infinito\" pues \"toma sobre s\u00ed el mal del mundo para vencerlo\".\n Por ello, considera que a todos \"har\u00e1 bien\" esta Semana Santa \"mirar el crucifijo, besar las yagas de Jes\u00fas y decirle 'gracias' porque eso lo hizo por cada uno\".\n Al final del resumen de su catequesis en espa\u00f1ol, el Papa ha enviado un saludo a los peregrinos de lengua espa\u00f1ola, en especial, a los grupos procedentes de Espa\u00f1a, a los que se ha referido diciendo que la Plaza estaba \"llena de banderas\" de este pa\u00eds.  Tambi\u00e9n ha saludado a los fieles de Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Mexico, Uruguay --\"Vi varios mates por ah\u00ed\", ha indicado--, Argentina y otros pa\u00edses latinoamericanos.  A todos ellos, les ha invitado a vivir esta Pascua \"con certeza de que, en Jes\u00fas, Dios ama y perdona\".\n En lengua italiana, tambi\u00e9n ha saludado a los 3.000 estudiantes provenientes de m\u00e1s de 200 universidades de todo el mundo que han viajado a Roma para participar en el Forum Univ 2014, que llega a su 47 edici\u00f3n, en el que reflexionar\u00e1n sobre el tema 'Ecolog\u00eda de la persona y de su ambiente'.

                    "body": "Catequesis del Papa Francisco: Meditando sobre la Cruz de Cristo.  16 abril 2014 Queridos hermanos y hermanas, \u00a1buenos d\u00edas!\nhoy, en medio de la Semana Santa, la liturgia nos presenta aquel episodio triste, la historia de la traici\u00f3n de Judas, que va ante los jefes del Sanedr\u00edn para regatear y entregarles a su Maestro.  \u00bfCu\u00e1nto me dan si yo se los entrego?  Y Jes\u00fas, desde aquel momento tiene un precio.  Este acto dram\u00e1tico marca el inicio de la Pasi\u00f3n de Cristo, un doloroso camino que \u00c9l elige con libertad absoluta.  Y lo dice claramente \u00c9l mismo: \"yo doy mi vida ...N Nadie me la quita, sino que la doy por m\u00ed mismo.  Tengo el poder de darla y de retomarla \"(Jn 10:17-18).  Y as\u00ed, comienza ese camino de la humillaci\u00f3n, de la expoliaci\u00f3n, con esta traici\u00f3n.  Jes\u00fas, como si estuviera en el mercado: \"esto cuesta 30 denarios\" y Jes\u00fas recorre este camino de humillaci\u00f3n y de la expoliaci\u00f3n hasta el final.\n Jes\u00fas alcanza la humillaci\u00f3n completa con la \"muerte en cruz\".  Se trata de la peor de las muertes, destinada a los esclavos y a los delincuentes.  Jes\u00fas era considerado un profeta, pero muere como un delincuente.  Observando a Jes\u00fas en su pasi\u00f3n, vemos como en un espejo, tambi\u00e9n los sufrimientos de toda la humanidad y encontramos la respuesta divina al misterio del mal, del dolor, de la muerte.  Y muchas veces sentimos horror ante el mal y el dolor que nos rodea y nos preguntamos: \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Dios permite esto?\".  Es una herida profunda para nosotros ver el sufrimiento y la muerte, \u00a1sobre todo la de los inocentes!  Cuando vemos sufrir a los ni\u00f1os es una herida en el coraz\u00f3n, es el misterio del mal y Jes\u00fas toma todo este mal, todo este sufrimiento sobre s\u00ed mismo.\n Esta semana nos har\u00e1 bien a todos nosotros mirar el Crucifijo, besar las llagas de Jes\u00fas, besarlas en el Crucifijo.  \u00c9l ha tomado sobre \u00c9l todo el sufrimiento humano, se ha \"vestido\" de ese sufrimiento.\n Nosotros esperamos que Dios en su omnipotencia derrote la injusticia, el mal, el pecado y el sufrimiento con una triunfante victoria.  Dios nos muestra, en cambio, una humilde victoria que humanamente parece un fracaso.  Y podemos decir, Dios vence en la derrota precisamente.  El Hijo de Dios, de hecho, aparece en la cruz como un hombre derrotado: sufre, es traicionado, insultado y finalmente muere.  Jes\u00fas permite que el mal se ensa\u00f1e con \u00c9l y lo toma sobre s\u00ed para vencerlo.  Su pasi\u00f3n no es un accidente; su muerte - aquella muerte - estaba \"escrita\".  De verdad, no tenemos tanta explicaci\u00f3n, es un misterio desconcertante, el misterio de la gran humildad de Dios: \"Dios - en efecto - am\u00f3 tanto al mundo, que entreg\u00f3 a su Hijo \u00fanico\".  (Jn 3,16).\n La pasi\u00f3n y la muerte de Jes\u00fas y las frustraciones de tantas esperanzas humanas son el camino real a trav\u00e9s del cual Dios obra nuestra salvaci\u00f3n.  Un camino que no corresponde a los criterios humanos, es m\u00e1s, los abate.  En sus heridas somos curados (cf.  1 P 2,24).\n Esta semana, pensemos tanto en el dolor de Jes\u00fas, y dig\u00e1monos a nosotros mismos: \"\u00a1y \u00e9sto es por m\u00ed!\" Aunque yo hubiera sido la \u00fanica persona en el mundo, \u00c9l lo habr\u00eda hecho.  \u00a1Lo ha hecho por m\u00ed!  Y besemos el Crucifijo y digamos: \"por m\u00ed, gracias Jes\u00fas, por m\u00ed\".\n Y cuando todo parece perdido, cuando no queda ninguno porque herir\u00e1n \"al pastor, y se dispersar\u00e1n las ovejas del reba\u00f1o\" (Mt 26,31), es entonces cuando Dios interviene con el poder de la resurrecci\u00f3n.  La resurrecci\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas no es el final feliz de un cuento de hadas, no es un final feliz de una pel\u00edcula, sino que es la intervenci\u00f3n de Dios Padre, all\u00ed donde est\u00e1 desecha la esperanza humana.  En el momento en el cual todo parece perdido, en el momento del dolor en el cual tantas personas sienten la necesidad de bajar de la cruz, es el momento m\u00e1s cercano a la resurrecci\u00f3n.  La noche se hace m\u00e1s oscura justamente antes de que empiece la ma\u00f1ana, antes que comience la luz.  En el momento m\u00e1s oscuro interviene Dios y resucita.\n Jes\u00fas, quien opt\u00f3 seguir por este camino, nos llama a seguirlo en su propio camino de humillaci\u00f3n.  Cuando en ciertos momentos de la vida no encontramos v\u00eda de escape a nuestras dificultades, cuando precipitamos en la oscuridad m\u00e1s densa, es el momento de nuestra humillaci\u00f3n y expoliaci\u00f3n total, es el tiempo en el que experimentamos que somos d\u00e9biles y pecadores, es entonces, en aquel momento, que no debemos enmascarar nuestro fracaso, sino abrirnos confiadamente a la esperanza en Dios, como hizo Jes\u00fas.\n Queridos hermanos y hermanas, esta semana nos har\u00e1 bien tomar el Crucifijo en la mano y besarlo tantas veces, y decir: \"gracias Jes\u00fas, gracias Se\u00f1or\".  As\u00ed sea.",
