                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama announced Monday he's done waiting for the House of Representatives to pass an immigration bill, and plans to take executive action to change deportation policies.\n In remarks from the White House, Obama said that given the House's decision not to move forward with a bill, he will act on his own, refocusing resources to border enforcement and looking into changes he can make to deportation policy.\n \"If Congress will not do their jobs, at least we can do ours,\" he said.\n House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told Obama last week that his chamber would not vote this year on immigration reform, Obama said.  The Senate passed a comprehensive bill one year ago, but Boehner quickly said he would not allow a vote on that legislation.  He did, however, say the House would work to address immigration reform in its own way.\n Meanwhile, Democrats and immigration reform advocates urged Obama to slow deportations, which hit a record high in the 2012 fiscal year.  Although the high numbers have also come with an increased focus on priorities set by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (such as convicted criminals and repeat border-crossers), advocates say there's plenty to be done that would make the process more humane for people with longstanding ties to the country.\n Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson had been working on a review of deportation policies, but it was put on hold in May at the president's request, to give the House time to pass its own bill -- to no avail.\n Boehner said in a statement that he told Obama last week it would be tough for the House to move forward given distrust of the president.  They spoke last week at a reception celebrating American golf players.\n \"Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue,\" he said.  \"The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system.  It is sad and disappointing that -- faced with this challenge -- President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems.\" \"\nRepublicans have been critical of Obama's previous executive actions on immigration, claiming he subverted the law by giving relief to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.  Boehner is currently planning a lawsuit against Obama for executive overreach, which may include that immigration action.\n Obama said that if House Republicans don't want him to take executive action, they should pass legislation.\n \"If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is to passing bills,\" he said.  \"Pass a bill.  Solve a problem.  Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done.\" \"\nThe president announced he will send more resources to the border to detain and deport undocumented immigrants, although interior enforcement will continue as well.  The border has increasingly become a point of contention given the current influx of unaccompanied minors crossing illegally.  The White House requested $2 billion from Congress to deal with the crisis, and for the authority to \"fast track\" screenings and deportations of unaccompanied minors.\n Obama criticized Republicans who say they can't do anything on immigration because of the crisis, and said they're using it as \"their newest excuse.\" \"\n\"Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn't make an effort to fix it,\" he said.  \"It makes no sense.  It's not on the level.  It's just politics, plain and simple.\" \"",

If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.\u00e2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\nObama delayed an internal review of deportation enforcement policies at the Department of Homeland Security until the end of summer in hopes that the House GOP would move forward on comprehensive immigration legislation.\n Having given up on that, the president's review probably will focus on how far the administration can go in expanding a 2012 program focused on immigrants brought to the United States as children, which has allowed more than 500,000 undocumented people to live and work in the country.\n House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio told Obama last week that there would not be an immigration vote in the House this year, spurring the president's vow to take action.  Obama, pointing to a bipartisan Senate deal on immigration that was approved in 2013, chided House Republicans for bowing to extremist pressures in their party rather than pursuing changes backed by most Americans.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Obama said, raising his voice.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead, they've proven again and again that they're unwilling to stand up to the Tea Party in order to do what's best for the country.  And the worst part about it is, a bunch of them know better.\u00e2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFor more than a year, White House officials have held out hope that House Republicans would pass an overhaul of immigration laws, driven by pressure from business interests and a political desire to win Latino votes.\n But GOP leaders blame Obama for failing to adequately protect the border and for using executive authority to circumvent Congress \u00e2\u0080\" a complaint exacerbated by his decision to go it alone on immigration.  Boehner has announced plans to sue Obama over his use of executive actions, and the Supreme Court ruled last week that the president acted unconstitutionally by appointing several high-level aides without Senate approval.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeaker Boehner told the president exactly what he has been telling him: The American people and their elected officials don't trust him to enforce the law as written,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cUntil that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue.\u00e2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d",

The president sent a letter to Congress on Monday asking for additional resources to deal with the problem of unaccompanied minors entering the country and creating a humanitarian crisis.\n Obama repeated on Monday that most of those children would be sent home.\n That crisis and the death of reform legislation puts Obama in the awkward position of studying new ways to help the undocumented workers who have been in the country for years while getting tougher on juveniles who are entering now.\n Not long ago the White House had held out hope that House Republicans would move on immigration reform this summer before November congressional elections.  It delayed a review by the Department of Homeland Security over changes to U.S. deportation policy to give lawmakers space to pursue a legislative solution.\n Many members of Congress have predicted that if legislation is not enacted this year, any new attempts would have to wait until 2017 after a new president takes office.\n (Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, Mark Felsenthal, and Annika McGinnis; Editing by Tom Brown)",

                    "body": "(CNN) -- It's their fault, President Barack Obama said Monday in blaming Republican inaction on immigration reform for escalating problems including a surge of undocumented children crossing the border from Mexico.  At a hastily scheduled Rose Garden appearance, Obama said the top House Republican -- Speaker John Boehner -- told him last week that the chamber's GOP majority will continue blocking a vote on a Senate-passed immigration bill.\n In response, Obama said he was starting \"a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.\" \"\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder will \"identify additional actions my administration can take within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can,\" the President said.\n \"If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours,\" he said, adding he expected the recommendations by the end of summer and would act on them without delay.\n \"The failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, is bad for our economy, is bad for our future,\" Obama said.  \"America cannot wait forever for them to act.\" \"\nObama's statement sought to vilify Republicans for the failure to get congressional approval for immigration reform, an issue important to his base.\n \"Pass a bill.  Solve a problem.  Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done,\" he said, repeating his contention that a bill would win bipartisan approval if Boehner allowed it to come to a vote in the House.\n Conservative Republicans oppose the Senate plan passed last year with support from both parties support because it includes a pathway to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the United States.\n They also fear that such a reform measure would bolster already strong Democratic support among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority.\n For his part, Boehner said Monday that Republicans don't trust Obama to enforce laws they might pass.\n \"Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue,\" he said in a statement after Obama spoke.  \"The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system.\" \"\nHe continued, \"It is sad and disappointing that -- faced with this challenge -- President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems.\" \"\nBoehner noted that previous executive action by Obama to halt deportations of some undocumented children led to the current border crisis by \"giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay.\" \"\nIn his statement, Obama announced he was ordering a shift in security resources to border regions, and he promised the additional action he can take \"without Congress but within his existing authorities to fix as much of our broken immigration system as we can.\" \"\nThe President also sent Congress a letter asking that legislators work with him on providing additional money and leeway to deal with the situation on the southern border.\n On Sunday, an administration official told CNN the money -- which could exceed $2 billion -- would go to securing appropriate space for the detention of children but also stemming the tide of immigrants.\n The government hopes to increase its ability to investigate and dismantle smuggling organizations as well as quickly return children and adults to their home countries if they do not qualify for asylum, according to that official.\n So far, the federal government has struggled to process and accommodate the influx of illegal human traffic but specifically the spike in children.\n U.S. authorities estimate that between 60,000 to 80,000 children without parents will cross the border this year in what the White House is calling an \"immediate humanitarian crisis.\" \"\nEarlier in June, the White House announced a plan to spend millions in a government-wide response by sending aide to governments in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help with crime and violence prevention.\n In mid-June, Vice President Joe Biden also spoke with leaders in the three countries as well as Mexico about working together to promote security.\n Biden's objective was to emphasize that adults arriving with their children in the United States don't meet the requirements for a policy that defers deportation for children brought to the United States before June 15, 2012.\n Obama also spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto about the issue and has warned families who see the dangerous trip as the best option for their children.",

                    "body": "U.S. President Barack Obama will take executive power to pass immigration reform.  Reuters\nIn a long-awaited announcement, U.S. President Barack Obama said yesterday that he is planning on taking executive action to resolve the issue announcement of immigration reform.  After considering the possibility of a compromise on immigration reform in Congress 'dead,' the President said he was left with no other option than to take executive action on the matter.  He blamed the Republican majority in the House of Representatives for its paralysis on immigration.\n Obama's statement came after Republican John Boehner, speaker of the House, reported last week that the immigration legislature would not be voted on this year, despite reforms having passed last year by the Democratic majority in the Senate.  \"The failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, it's bad for our economy, and it's bad for our future,\" Obama said of House Republicans during a statement Monday afternoon in the Rose Garden.  \"America cannot wait forever for them to act.  That's why, today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our broken immigration system as I can on my own.\" \"\n\"If Congress does not do its job, at least we can do ours,\" he said.  The speech highlighted the problems facing the president.  The combative speech highlighted the political problems facing the president: on the one hand, increasing pressure from Hispanics and pro-immigration groups that were part of his electoral coalition but are growing increasingly impatient, and on the other, the reluctance of Republicans to pass a law because it could be seen as a victory for the Democrats.\n Obama did not say what measures he would take to implement the changes.  Administrative measures could range from simply instructing law enforcement agencies to reorient their priorities for deportations to facilitating procedures for some migrant groups.  Boehner attacked the President for taking matters into his own hands: \"It is sad and disappointing that -- faced with this challenge -- President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems,\" he said in a statement.",

                    "body": "Angry Obama criticises House Republicans for failing to pass legislation to reform America's immigration system\nGood afternoon, everybody.  One year ago this month, senators of both parties -- with support from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities -- came together to pass a commonsense immigration bill.\n Independent experts said that bill would strengthen our borders, grow our economy, shrink our deficits.  As we speak, there are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House to pass an immigration bill today.  I would sign it into law today, and Washington would solve a problem in a bipartisan way.\n But for more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system.  And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give Speaker Boehner the space he needed to get his fellow Republicans on board.\n Meanwhile, here's what a year of obstruction has meant.  It has meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders.  It's meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules, and drives down wages for hardworking Americans.  It's meant lost talent when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers.  It's meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line.  It's meant the heartbreak of separated families.\n That's what this obstruction has meant over the past year.  That's what the Senate bill would fix if the House allowed it to go to a vote.\n Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill.  They'd be following the will of the majority of the American people who support reform.  Instead, they've proven again and again that they're unwilling to stand up to the tea party in order to do what's best for the country.  And the worst part about it is a bunch of them know better.\n We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.  In recent weeks, we've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers.\n The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids.  The children who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of while they go through the legal process, but in most cases that process will lead to them being sent back home.  I've sent a clear message to parents in these countries not to put their kids through this.  I recently sent Vice President Biden to meet with Central American leaders and find ways to address the root causes of this crisis.  Secretary Kerry will also be meeting with those leaders again tomorrow.  With our international partners, we're taking new steps to go after the dangerous smugglers who are putting thousands of children's lives at risk.\n Today, I sent a letter to congressional leaders asking that they work with me to address the urgent humanitarian challenge on the border, and support the immigration and Border Patrol agents who already apprehend and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants every year.  And understand, by the way, for the most part, this is not a situation where these children are slipping through.  They're being apprehended.  But the problem is, is that our system is so broken, so unclear that folks don't know what the rules are.\n Now, understand -- there are a number of Republicans who have been willing to work with us to pass real, commonsense immigration reform, and I want to thank them for their efforts.  There are a number of Republican leaders in the Senate who did excellent work and deserve our thanks.  And less visibly, there have been folks in the House who have been trying to work to get this done.  And quietly, because it doesn't always help me to praise them, I've expressed to them how much I appreciate the efforts that they've made.\n I believe Speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill.  I think he genuinely wants to get something done.  But last week, he informed me that Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year.  Some in the House Republican Caucus are using the situation with unaccompanied children as their newest excuse to do nothing.  Now, I want everybody to think about that.  Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn't make an effort to fix it.  It makes no sense.  It's not on the level.  It's just politics, plain and simple.\n Now, there are others in the Republican Caucus in the House who are arguing that they can't act because they're mad at me about using my executive authority too broadly.  This also makes no sense.  I don't prefer taking administrative action.  I'd rather see permanent fixes to the issue we face.  Certainly that's true on immigration.  I've made that clear multiple times.  I would love nothing more than bipartisan legislation to pass the House, the Senate, land on my desk so I can sign it.  That's true about immigration, that's true about the minimum wage, it's true about equal pay.  There are a whole bunch of things where I would greatly prefer Congress actually do something.  I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing.  And in this situation, the failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, it's bad for our economy, and it's bad for our future.\n So while I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act -- and I hope their constituents will too -- America cannot wait forever for them to act.  And that's why, today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.  As a first step, I'm directing the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border.  Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority, but we are going to refocus our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure.\n I have also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.  If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.  I expect their recommendations before the end of summer and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay.\n Of course, even with aggressive steps on my part, administrative action alone will not adequately address the problem.  The reforms that will do the most to strengthen our businesses, our workers, and our entire economy will still require an act of Congress.  And I repeat: These are reforms that already enjoy the wide support of the American people.  It's very rare where you get labor, business, evangelicals, law enforcement all agreeing on what needs to be done.  And at some point, that should be enough.  Normally, that is enough.  The point of public service is to solve public problems.  And those of us who have the privilege to serve have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep Americans safe and to keep the doors of opportunity open.\n And if we do, then one year from now, not only would our economy and our security be stronger, but maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come study here would stay and create jobs here.  Maybe companies that play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that don't.  Maybe more families who've been living here for years, whose children are often U.S. citizens, who are our neighbors and our friends, whose children are our kids' friends and go to school with them, and play on ball teams with them, maybe those families would get to stay together.  But much of this only happens if Americans continue to push Congress to get this done.\n So I've told Speaker Boehner that even as I take those steps that I can within my existing legal authorities to make the immigration system work better, I'm going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill.  Maybe it will be after the midterms, when they're less worried about politics.  Maybe it will be next year.  Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.  I have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect.  And the Senate bill was a good example of the capacity to compromise and get this done.  The only thing I can't do is stand by and do nothing while waiting for them to get their act together.\n And I want to repeat what I said earlier.  If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills.  Pass a bill; solve a problem.  Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done.  Because if we pass a bill, that will supplant whatever I've done administratively.  We'll have a structure there that works, and it will be permanent.  And people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on the law.  And there will be clarity both here inside this country and outside it.\n Let me just close by saying Friday is the Fourth of July.  It's the day we celebrate our independence and all the things that make this country so great.  And each year, Michelle and I host a few hundred servicemembers and wounded warriors and their families right here on the lawn for a barbecue and fireworks on the Mall.\n And some of the servicemembers coming this year are unique because they signed up to serve, to sacrifice, potentially to give their lives for the security of this country even though they weren't yet Americans.  That's how much they love this country.  They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to.  I think they've earned their stripes in more ways than one.  And that's why on Friday morning we're going to naturalize them in a ceremony right here at the White House.  This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens.\n One of the things we celebrate on Friday -- one of the things that make this country great -- is that we are a nation of immigrants.  Our people come from every corner of the globe.  That's what makes us special.  That's what makes us unique.  And throughout our history, we've come here in wave after wave from everywhere understanding that there was something about this place where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts; that all the different cultures and ideas and energy would come together and create something new.\n We won this country's freedom together.  We built this country together.  We defended this country together.  It makes us special.  It makes us strong.  It makes us Americans.  That's worth celebrating.  And that's what I want not just House Republicans but all of us as Americans to remember.",

Once again, Mr. Obama tried to reach a deal with Republicans on one of his signature legislative priorities -- and once again, the passage of time only seemed to make a deal more unlikely.\n Well after virtually everyone else, Mr. Obama on Monday declared his efforts to win immigration legislation dead.  As he did during his gun-control push in 2013, he tried giving Republicans time and political space to reach a deal.  And like that effort, this ended with an angry president expressing his disappointment with Congress during an afternoon Rose Garden address.\n The longer the House waited to act after Senate passed its immigration bill, chance of a deal became less likely.  On Monday, he said House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) told him last week there would be no vote on immigration this year.\n \"For more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system,\" Mr. Obama said.  \"And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give Speaker Boehner the space he needed to get his fellow Republicans on board.\" \"\nThis was not unlike Mr. Obama's April 2013 speech marking the background checks bill that failed to pass a Senate filibuster.  Mr. Obama touched all his familiar angry and disappointed notes: The American people are with him, Republicans refuse to listen to their constituents and deep down, people who publicly oppose a broad immigration reform would rather do what he wants.\n \"Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill,\" Mr. Obama said.  \"They'd be following the will of the majority of the American people, who support reform.

And the worst part about it is, a bunch of them know better.\" \"\nMr. Boehner, for his part, said he told Mr. Obama -- at a White House event to honor pro golfers last week -- that there can be no deal because \"the American people and their elected officials don't trust him to enforce the law as written.\" \" Mr. Obama called that argument hogwash.\n \"There are others in the Republican caucus in the House who are arguing that they can't act because they're mad at me about using my executive authority too broadly,\" Mr. Obama said.  \"This also makes no sense.\" \"\nThere were few political recriminations for Mr. Obama after the gun-control failure, though he recently called it his biggest disappointment.  But he faces enormous pressure from immigration advocates to take executive action to reduce the number of deportations.  Mr. Obama hinted - again, as he did when pressure spiked in March - that he will direct subordinates to \"identify additional actions my administration can take on our own,\" but his administration told advocates as recently as last week not to expect broad unilateral action.\n Pablo Alvarado, the president of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which has been among the loudest agitators for Mr. Obama to act without Congress, called Monday \"a pivotal moment in the movement for migrant rights.\" \"\n\"In de-linking his immigration policy from his legislative reform strategy, the president is now free to do the right thing, and he can fulfill the promise of being a transformative president,\" Mr. Alvarado said.  \"The president's enforcement-first strategy and his misguided deportation policy were premised on the possibility of legislative reform, but it is now very clear Congress itself is broken.\" \"\nIn his remarks Monday, Mr. Obama said he expects recommendations from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder by \"the end of the summer, and I intend to adopt these recommendations without delay.\" \"",

Maybe it will be after midterms, when they're less worried about politics.  Maybe it will be next year,\" he said.  \"I have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect.\" \"\nThe United Fresh Produce Association praised Obama's \"commitment\" for moving the issue ahead but again urged the House to take up immigration reform and save fruit and vegetable production from being driven out of the United States.\n \"We appreciate President Obama's commitment to try to address our broken immigration policy through executive action, but urge the House of Representatives not to abandon their responsibility to address this serious issue,\" Tom Stenzel, United Fresh president and chief executive officer, said in a statement Monday.\n \"If the House continues to disregard its responsibility to address this issue, the produce industry has no choice but to work with the Administration on short-term administrative patches that will be appreciated, but are ultimately unsatisfactory,\" Stenzel said.\n \"Congressional inaction on immigration reform is driving fruit and vegetable production out of the United State, costing U.S. consumers and farmers millions of dollars, and eliminating jobs across the produce supply chain,\" he said.",

Obama said simply that his team would deliver recommendations for executive actions by the end of summer.\n The president said he would then immediately implement their best suggestions.\n Republicans, however, say that the president's inability to enforce the laws on the books essentially made it impossible to pass immigration reform through the GOP-controlled House.\n \"Speaker Boehner told the president exactly what he has been telling him: The American people and their elected officials don't trust him to enforce the law as written,\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.  \"Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue.\" \"\nIn recent months, the White House had opted to give Republicans space to negotiate a possible legislative package.  But with November's midterm elections swiftly approaching, there was little hope that a comprehensive bill would emerge in the House.\n The immigration debate has become even more heated with tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors being apprehended at the southwest border.\n Republicans say that the problem is proof that the White House is not committed to border security, while Obama counters that if conservatives cared about stiffer enforcement measures they would pass a new law.\n \"We are going to refocus our efforts,\" Obama said of his future executive actions.  \"If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.\" \"",

                    "body": "President Obama spoke delivered the following remarks at the White House on June 30.  Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.\n One year ago this month, senators of both parties -- with support from the business community, labor, law enforcement, faith communities -- came together to pass a common-sense immigration bill.  Independent experts said that bill would strengthen our borders, grow our economy, shrink our deficits.  As we speak, there are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House to pass an immigration bill today, I would sign it into law today, and Washington would solve a problem in a bipartisan way.\n But for more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system.  And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give Speaker Boehner the space he needed to get his fellow Republicans on board.\n Meanwhile, here's what a year of obstruction has meant.  It's meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders.  It's meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules and drives down wages for hardworking Americans.  It's meant lost talent, when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers.  It's meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line.  It's meant the heartbreak of separated families.  That's what this obstruction has meant over the past year.\n That's what the Senate bill would fix if the House allowed it to go to a vote.  Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill.  They'd be following the will of the majority of the American people, who support reform.  And instead they've proven again and again that they're unwilling to stand up to the tea party in order to do what's best for the country.  And the worst part about it is, a bunch of them know better.\n We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.  In recent weeks we've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers.  The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids.  The children who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of while they go through the legal process, but in most cases that process will lead to them being sent back home.\n I've sent a clear message to parents in these countries not to put their kids through this.  I recently sent Vice President Biden to meet with Central American leaders and find ways to address the root causes of this crisis.  Secretary Kerry will also be meeting with those leaders again tomorrow.\n With our international partners, we're taking new steps to go after the dangerous smugglers who are putting thousands of children (sic) lives at risk.  Today I sent a letter to congressional leaders asking that they work with me to address the urgent humanitarian challenge on the border and support the immigration and Border Patrol agents who already apprehend and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants every year.\n And understand, by the way, for the most part, this is not a situation where these children are slipping through.  They're being apprehended, but the problem is, is that our system is so broken, so unclear, that folks don't know what the rules are.\n Now, understand, there are a number of Republicans who have been willing to work with us to pass real common-sense immigration reform, and I want to thank them for their efforts.  There are a -- a -- a number of Republican leaders in the Senate who did excellent work and deserve our thanks.  And less visibly, there have been folks in the House who have been trying to work to get this done.\n And quietly -- because it doesn't always help me to praise them -- I've expressed to them how much I appreciate the efforts that they've made.\n I believe Speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass an immigration bill.  I think he genuinely wants to get something done.  But last week he informed the Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year.  Some in the House Republican caucus are using the situation with unaccompanied children as their newest excuse to do nothing.  Now I want everybody to think about that.  Their argument seems to be that because the system's broken, we shouldn't make an effort to fix it.  It makes no sense.  It's not on the level.  It's just politics, plain and simple.\n Now there are others in the Republican caucus in the House who are arguing that they can't act because they're mad at me about using my executive authority too broadly.  This also makes no sense.  I don't prefer taking administrative action.  I'd rather see permanent fixes to the issue we face.\n Certainly that's true on immigration.  I've made that clear multiple times.  I would love nothing more than bipartisan legislation to pass the House, the Senate, land on my desk, so I can sign it.\n That's true about immigration.  It's true about the minimum wage.  It's true about equal pay.  There are a whole bunch of things where I would greatly prefer Congress actually do something.\n I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing.\n And in this situation, the failure of House Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad for our security, it's bad for our economy and it's bad for our future.  So while I will continue to push House Republicans to drop the excuses and act -- and I hope their constituents will too -- America cannot wait forever for them to act.  And that's why today, I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.\n As a first step, I'm directing the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border.  Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority, but we are going to refocus our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure.\n I've also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.  If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.  I expect the recommendations before the end of the summer, and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay.\n Of course, even with aggressive steps on my part, administrative action alone will not adequately address the problem.\n The reforms that will do the most to strengthen our businesses, our workers and our entire economy will still require an act of Congress.\n And I repeat, these are reforms that already enjoy the widespread support of the American people.  It's very rare where you get labor, business, evangelicals, law enforcement all agreeing on what needs to be done.  And at some point, that should be enough.  Normally, that is enough.\n The point of public service is to solve public problems, and those of us who have the privilege to serve have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep Americans safe and to keep the doors of opportunity open.  And if we do, then one year from now not only would our economy and our security be stronger, but maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come to study here would stay and create jobs here.  Maybe companies that play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that don't.  Maybe more families who have been living here for years, whose children are often U.S. citizens, who are our neighbors and our friends, and whose children are our -- our kids' friends and go to school with them and play on ball teams with them, maybe those families would get to stay together.\n But much of this only happens if Americans continue to push Congress to get this done.  So I've told Speaker Boehner that even as I take those steps that I can within my existing legal authorities to make the immigration system work better, I'm going to continue to reach out to House Republicans in the hope that they deliver a more permanent solution with a comprehensive bill.  Maybe it will be after the midterms, when they're less worried about politics.  Maybe it will be next year.  Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.\n I have been consistent in saying that I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect, and the Senate bill was a good example of the capacity to compromise and get this done.  The only thing I can't do is stand by and do nothing while waiting for them to get their act together.\n And I want to repeat what I said earlier.  If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills.  Pass a bill.  Solve a problem.  Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done.  Because if we pass a bill, that will supplant whatever I've done administratively.  We'll have a structure there that works, and it will be permanent, and people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on the law, and there will be clarity, both here inside this country and outside it.\n Let me just close by saying that Friday's the 4th of July.  It's the day we celebrate our independence and all the things that make this country so great.  And each year Michelle and I host a few hundred servicemembers and wounded warriors and their families right here on the lawn for a barbecue and fireworks on the Mall.\n And some of the service members coming this year are unique because they signed up to serve, to sacrifice, potentially to give their lives for the security of this country even though they weren't yet Americans.  That's how much they love this country.  They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to.\n I think they've earned their stripes in more ways than one, and that's why on Friday morning we're going to naturalize them in a ceremony right here at the White House.  This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens.\n And one of the things we celebrate on Friday, one of the things that makes this country great is that we are a nation of immigrants.  Our people come from every corner of the globe.  That's what makes us special.  That's what makes us unique.\n And throughout our history, we've come here in wave after wave from everywhere understanding that there was something about this place where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts, that all the different cultures and ideas and energy would come together and create something new.  We won this country's freedom together.  We built this country together.  We defended this country together.  It makes us special.  It makes us strong.  It makes us Americans.  It's worth celebrating, and that's what I want not just House Republicans, but all of us as Americans to remember.  Thanks very much.",

More than 40,000 children from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador have been caught this year, and he has mobilized various federal agencies to house them and process them through the deportation system.\n The president ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate the federal agencies that have been catching, processing and housing the children.  The Department of Justice is in the process of reassigning immigration judges and U.S. attorneys to the border to speed up hearings in immigration court, and the Department of Health and Human Services has scoured the country to find places to put those children.\n In March, Obama ordered Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to conduct a systemwide review of deportation practices to see how they could be done \"more humanely.\" \" Obama later asked that the results of that review be postponed until the end of the summer to give Congress time to work through an immigration bill.  Monday, with 28 days left in the legislative calendar, Obama said the review would be completed soon and would include changes to the country's immigration enforcement structure.\n Obama said the only response from Republicans has been to use the crisis as their \"newest excuse to do nothing.\" \"\n\"Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn't make an effort to fix it,\" he said.  \"It makes no sense.  It's not on the level.\" \"\nThe Senate passed a comprehensive immigration rewrite last year, but House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said he won't bring it up for a vote in his chamber.  The House has not advanced its own legislation.  Boehner told Obama last week that Republicans believe the president can't be trusted to carry out the immigration enforcement aspects of the bill.\n \"In our conversation last week, I told the president what I have been telling him for months now: The American people and their elected officials don't trust him to enforce the law as written,\" Boehner said in a statement after Obama's speech.  \"The crisis at our southern border reminds us all of the critical importance of fixing our broken immigration system.  It is sad and disappointing that -- faced with this challenge -- President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems.\" \"\nCritics of his administration said Obama's statement proves he's not interested in passing a comprehensive fix of immigration laws in Congress and is worried only about the political fallout for the Democratic Party.\n Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the president has developed a predictable practice of creating programs that help immigrants come election time.  In June 2012, he created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that has allowed more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children to file with the federal government to avoid deportation.  And now, Stein said, he will \"conveniently\" release the findings of his deportation review a few months before the election in November.\n \"(The speech) wasn't a sincere effort to advance policy.  It was partisan,\" Stein said.  \"And now he will try to do the same, grand gesture somewhere between mid-August and the November election, a get-out-the-vote move.\" \"\n2700 CONNECT 123 TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 593 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1lKvDJU",

                    "body": "President Obama announced Monday he's tired of waiting for Speaker John Boehner to act on immigration reform and that he intends to independently address the issue.  Obama's White House announcement came just hours after he requested a funding increase from congress to deal with millions of children illegally crossing the border from South American countries.\n \"If House Republicans are upset about me taking too many executive actions, there's a solution: pass a bill,\" Obama said Monday, in reference to the long wait and arguably extreme measures the President has taken to deal with immigration over the last year.  He pledged to pursue \"a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress.\" \" He did not did not indicate what specific action he intends to take at this time.\n The President complained about waiting for over a year for the House to act on immigration reform, specifically calling out Boehner.  Speaker Boehner has said the House will not vote on an immigration bill this year and announced a lawsuit against the President's use of executive actions last week.\n Earlier Monday, the President sent a surprise request to Congress asking for roughly $2 billion to deal with the influx of children attempting to cross the border illegally from South America.  While children from Mexico can be deported fairly easily, immigrants who travel from as far as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are much more difficult and expensive.\n The move will likely cause chaos on Capitol Hill, but could potentially force the House to finally deal with immigration reform.  It's a catch-22 for politicians: vote to deport a bunch of children and solve a very real problem, or vote to deport a bunch of children and look heartless in the eyes of your constituents.  Hard line immigration reform opponents will love it regardless.  \"...for many others, particularly Democrats and Republicans representing areas with large immigrant populations, the prospect of such a heart-wrenching vote could fuel arguments that the time has come for broader immigration reform,\" writes the LA Times' Lisa Mascaro and Brian Bennett.\n The bulk of the President's letter to Congress, via Politico:\n\"While overall apprehensions across our entire border have only slightly increased during this time period and remain at near historic lows, we have seen a significant rise in apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America who are crossing into the United States in the R\u00edo Grande Valley areas of the Southwest border,\" Obama wrote to congressional leaders Monday.  \"The individuals who embark upon this perilous journey are subject to violent crime, abuse, and extortion as they rely on dangerous human smuggling networks to transport them through Central America and Mexico.\" \"",

See More This is an ABC news.  Good afternoon I'm David -- from ABC news headquarters in New York to become on the air at this hour because the president is expected to talk about the lightning rod issue.  Of immigration from the Rose Garden just moments from now.  As you know in recent days we've reported here on the influx of children crossing into the US from the south.  Many of them without their parents are cameras right there are so many of them being held in facilities here in the US.  The president right here on ABC news in recent days with the message aimed at parents south of the border to not send your children to the US the White House saying quote.  Showing up on the border illegally is not a ticket to this country.  President Obama had been hoping congress would vote on an immigration overhaul this year our White House team reporting.  But the speaker of the house informing the president the house will not take a vote.  On reform this year so let's bring in ABC's White House correspond to -- of of course has been reporting from the border in recent weeks he's now back in Washington.  At the White House awaiting the president as well and Jim what are we expecting.  Well David it was about a year ago back in June 27 of last year that the senate.  Pass the comprehensive immigration reform bill since -- the White House has been waiting for the congress to -- for the house to follow up.  It is not done so the president today is expected to say.  He's given up on the congress and he's going to act on his own.  He won't say exactly how is gonna act we understand but you will tell us about that his aides have been asked to come up with some ideas and that they'll present to him by the end of summer.  You heard that from Jim -- a right there the president is expected to.  -- here in the Rose Garden that he will take executive action to get around congress he had been hoping for immigration reform that there'd be some sort of vote by year's end.  Informed in recent days by the speaker of house John Boehner that there would not be a vote by the end of the year mr. Who's been at the border in the last couple weeks now in Washington saying that the president now it would appear is -- is looking to take action on his own.  The White House saying that this would not replace what what congress could do but in the meantime that he would take steps.  However in -- selling covers Capitol Hill forest -- how.  His comments -- was expected to react to this.  Well David congress is not going to react very well to this at all it's one of the reasons that the House of Representatives the Republicans are bringing a lawsuit against the president they say he's been overreaching -- -- His entire.  That time in office that this is -- those controversial.  Issue.  Republicans in the house or so skittish and so skeptical.  Of doing anything on immigration reform so the chances of passing this we're not very strong anyway but that word from speaker Boehner last week to the president privately.  Was just -- a final chapter honored -- it.  -- thank you it's expected the president will direct the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general to look at options to present those options to the White House and as you heard Jeff.  Report there that this is expected not to be.  Taken.  Welcomed by many members of congress who have informed the president that they would not move on immigration reform this year.  The president has been criticized for taking.  Executive action before on a number of issues.  And we wanna go back to -- -- in you have been at the border and as we await the president here.  You've seen it yourself the mother in particular the image that we aired on world news collapsing.  As she brought to her own family crossed the border collapsing when they told her -- made it to the US.  Oh that's right David in fact that -- -- two separate issues the president has said that the only way to fix what's going on the border.  Right now where this influx of Central American unaccompanied minors this to pass comprehensive immigration reform.  He's been disappointed that this has not happened -- supposed to come here with the vice president any moment now and announce that he is in fact gonna take his own actions as you say David.  And what -- -- -- what they're studying a couple of main things about mostly about deportations.  As the president the vice president make their way -- to the podium.  -- at the White House and thanks to you Indian -- felony and the president with the vice president they're behind at holy spirit murder verdict.  One year ago this month.  Senators of both parties.  With support from the business community of labor.  Law enforcement.  Faith communities.  Came together to pass a common sense immigration.  Independent experts said that bill would strengthen our borders.  To grow our economy.  Shrink our deficits.  As we speak there are enough Republicans and Democrats in the house.  To pass an immigration bill today.  I would sign it into law.  Today.  In Washington.  Would solve a problem.  In a bipartisan way.  But for more than a year.  Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up or down vote.  On that senate bill.  Or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system.  And I held off on pressuring them for a long time to give speaker Boehner the space he needed.  To get this fellow Republicans on board.  Meanwhile here's what a year.  Of obstruction has meant.  It's meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders.  It's meant more businesses -- -- game the system by hiring undocumented workers which punishes businesses the play by the rules.  And drives down wages for hard working Americans.  It's -- lost talent.  When the best and brightest from around the world come to study here -- -- forced to leave.  And then compete against our businesses and our workers.  It's meant no chance for eleven million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship.  If they pay a penalty and -- -- Brett background check.  Pay their fair share of taxes learn English.  Go to the back of the line.  It's -- the heartbreak of separated families.  That's what this obstruction has meant over the past year.  That's what the senate bill would fix.  If the house.  Allowed it to go to -- vote.  Our country and our economy would be stronger today.  If house Republicans had allowed a simple yes or no vote on this bill or for that matter any bill.  -- be following the will of the majority of the American people who support reform.  And instead -- proven again and again that they're unwilling to stand up.  To the Tea Party in order to do what's best for the country.  And the worst part about it is a bunch of no matter.  We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop -- politics.  And fix our immigration system -- -- -- In recent weeks we've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border.  Brought here and other countries by smugglers and traffickers.  The journey is.  Unbelievably dangerous for these kids.  The children who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of want to go through the legal process but in most cases that process will lead to them being sent back home.  I've sent a clear message to parents in these countries not to put their kids through this.  A recently sent.  Vice President Biden to meet with Central American leaders.  And find ways to address the root causes of this crisis.  Secretary -- will also be meeting -- those leaders again tomorrow.  -- our international partners were taking new steps to go after the dangerous smugglers were putting thousands of children lives at risk.  Today I sent a letter to congressional leaders asking that they work -- made to address.  The urgent humanitarian challenge on the border and support the immigration and Border Patrol agents.  Who already apprehend and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants every year.  And understand by the way for the most part.  This is not a situation where these children are slipping through.  They're being apprehended.  But the problem is is that.  Our system is so broken so -- clear.  That folks don't know what the rules are.  Now understands.  There are a number of Republicans who have -- willing to work with us to pass real common sense immigration reform.  And I want to thank them for their efforts.  There -- A number of Republican leaders in the senate.  Who did excellent work.  And deserve.  Our thanks.  And less visibly there -- folks in the house have been trying.  To work to get this done.  And quietly.  Because doesn't always help me to praise them.  I've expressed to them how much I appreciate their efforts that they make.  I believe speaker Boehner when he says he wants to pass.  An immigration bill I think he genuinely wants to get something done.  But last week.  The informing the Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year.  Some in the house vote and caucus are using the situation -- unaccompanied children as there newest excuse to do nothing.  I want her way to think about bet they're argument seems to be that.  Because the system's broken.  We should make an effort fix it.  It makes no sense.  It's not on the level.  It's just politics.  Plain and simple.  Other others in the Republican caucus in the house.  Who arguing that they can't act because they're mad at me about using my executive authority.  Too broadly.  This also makes no sense.  I don't prefer taking administrative action.  I'd rather see permanent fixes.  To -- issue we face certainly that's true on immigration.  I've made that clear multiple times I would love nothing more.  Then bipartisan legislation to pass the house the senate land on my desk so I can -- -- about immigration.  Mr. about the minimum wage.  -- about equal pay their whole bunch of things where I would greatly prefer.  Congress actually do something.  I take executive action only when we have a serious.  Problem.  A serious issue.  And congress chooses to do nothing.  And in this situation.  The failure of house Republicans to pass a darn bill is bad -- security it's bad for our economy.  That's bad for our future.  So.  While I won't continue to push house Republicans to drop the -- -- -- -- And I hope their constituents well to.  America cannot wait for ever.  For them to act.  And that's why today.  I'm beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own.  Without congress.  As first up I'm directing the -- of Homeland Security.  And the attorney general to move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the more.  Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority but we are going to refocus.  Our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure.  I've also directed secretary -- Johnson and attorney general holder.  -- identified additional actions my administration can take on our -- within my existing legal authorities.  To do what congress refuses to do and -- as much of our immigration system as we can't.  If congress will not do their job at least we can do -- Expect the recommendations before the end of the summer.  And I -- to adopt those recommendations without further delay.  Of course even with aggressive steps on my part administrative action alone will not adequately.  Address the problem.  The reforms that will do the most to strengthen our businesses -- workers and our entire economy.  -- still require an act of congress.  And I repeat these are reforms that already enjoy the wide support of the American people.  It's very rare where you get labor business.  -- evangelicals.  Law enforcement.  All agreeing.  On what needs to be done.  And at some point.  -- should be enough normally that is enough to.  The point of public services to solve public problems and those of us.  Who have the privilege to serve have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep Americans safe and -- keep the doors of opportunity open.  And if we do.  Than one year from now not only what our economy our security be stronger but.  Maybe the best and the brightest from around the world who come to study here would stay and create jobs here.  Maybe company is the pure play by the rules will no longer be undercut by companies that don't.  Maybe more families have been living here for years.  Whose children are often US citizens.  For our neighbors and our friends.  And his children are our kids' friends and go to school -- and play on ball teams what.  Maybe those families would get to stay together.  But much of this only happens if Americans.  Continue to push congress to get this done.  So -- told speaker -- That even as.  I take those steps that I -- within my existing legal authorities.  -- make the immigration system work better.  -- continue to reach out.  To house Republicans.  In the hope that they deliver more from permanent solution.  -- -- comprehensive bill.  Maybe you'll be after the mid terms when -- less worried about politics.  Maybe you'll be next year.  Whenever it is they will find me a willing partner.  I've been consistent in saying.  That I am prepared to work with them even on a bill that I don't consider perfect.  And the senate bill was a good example.  The capacity to compromise and get this done the only thing I can't do is stand by and do nothing.  While waiting for them to get their act together.  And I want a repeat what I said earlier if house Republicans are really concerned about me.  Taking too many executive actions the best solution to that is passing bills.  Pass a bill.  Solve a problem.  Don't just say no. On something that everybody agrees needs to be done.  Because if we pass a bill.  That will.  It's a plant.  What are I've done administratively we'll have a structure there that works.  And it will be permanent.  And people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on.  The law.  -- -- -- -- Both here inside this.  Country and outside.  -- -- disclosed by saying Friday is the fourth of July.  Today we celebrate our independence.  And all the things the make this country so -- And each -- Michelle I host a few hundred service members and wounded warriors and their families.  Right here on the long for barbecue and fireworks on the mall.  Some of the service members coming -- -- unique.  Because they sign up to serve.  To sacrifice.  Potentially.  To give their lives.  For the security of this -- Even though they weren't yet Americans.  That's how much they love this country they were prepared to fight and die for an America.  They did not yet fully belong to.  I think they've earned their stripes and more ways than one.  That's why on Friday morning we're gonna nationalize them in a ceremony right here at the White House.  This Independence -- will be their first day as American citizens.  One of things we celebrate on Friday on things that makes this country great is that we are a nation.  Of immigrants.  Our people come from every corner of the goal.  That's what makes -- special that's what makes us unique.  And throughout our history we've come here in wave after wave from.  From everywhere.  Understanding that would.  There was something about this place where.  The hole was greater than the sum of its parts.  That all of -- different cultures and ideas and energy.  Would would would come together.  And and create something new.  We won this country's freedom together.  We built this country together we defended this country together.  It makes a special it makes a strong.  It makes us Americans.  -- we're celebrating.  And that's what I want.  Not just house Republicans but all of us as Americans to remember.  Thanks very much.  President Obama there at the White House clearly frustrated over the issue of immigration talking to the American people that make no mistake this was.  A message aimed squarely at the House of Representatives the president saying there are enough Democrats and Republicans.  Let's pass immigration reform today -- but that Republicans in the house have refused an up or down vote.  He said I take executive action only when congress chooses to do nothing and said he would talking about resources at the border security.  And that he would identify additional actions within his legal authority want to bring back into Celanese -- what exactly does that mean how much can -- get done and and it's not -- -- -- -- Capitol Hill is in recess how are they likely reacting this back in their home districts.  Well David I've been talking to some Republican leaders even as the president was speaking and it's clear that they are very agitated by this.  Speaker banners top aides tell me that the speaker did not definitively say.  That he would not bring up immigration reform he simply said how -- -- it would be.  Given the fact that the president is not believed by a lot of people in congress so what is happening here is just a complete breakdown of things between the White House and the president and David this conversation came between the president and speaker Boehner last week at the White House as they were -- added golfing events it was a private conversation that has led to this before meeting with Tiger -- -- I understand it -- meantime Jeff on legal authority -- just a few moments left how much can get done.  The fact is still be doing very small piecemeal things he cannot do anything conference -- -- big without congressional approval.  That executive actions in a very important a certain people so small actions in the days ahead.  We'll see how big they are -- -- selling to marvel at the White House for teens and Washington we think you will have much more.  And you can continue to get the latest on immigration reform -- this story on.  ABC news the mobile -- and get personalize alerts throughout the day of course we will have much more tonight on world news with Diane Sawyer I hope to see you a bit later here.  Until then have a good afternoon.  This has been a special.  From ABC.",

                    "body": "President Barack Obama speaks at Applied Materials, Inc. in Austin.\n President Obama said Monday that because Congress refuses to act on immigration reform, he is ready to fix as much of the broken system as he can on his own.\n The threat, made as tens of thousands of immigrants from Central America continue to flood over the country's southern border into Texas, was directed at House Republicans who he said have refused to vote on an omnibus immigration bill passed by the U.S. Senate last year.\n Obama said he would direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to provide him with a list of options his administration could take within \"existing legal authorities.\" \"\n\"I expect the recommendations before the end of the summer and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay,\" he said.\n The only immediate action the administration will take is to shift funds around from existing sources to place more resources on the border.  Obama said he will direct DHS and Holder to \"move available and appropriate resources from our interior to the border.\" \"\n\"Protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals has been and will remain the top priority,\" Obama said, \"but we are going to refocus our efforts where we can to make sure we do what it takes to keep our border secure.\" \"\nThe migrant surge of the last several weeks has further polarized a country already divided on immigration reform.  Republicans blame the administration's policies for confusing undocumented immigrants and luring them northward.  Democrats counter that violence and poverty have spurred the exodus, citing the rates of homicides in Central American countries.  According to a 2014 United Nations report, Honduras is the most violent country in the world.  El Salvador and Guatemala are fourth and fifth, respectively.\n In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the current surge at the border is a reminder that the nation's immigration system in broken.  But he said the president had refused to work with his party.\n \"President Obama won't work with us, but is instead intent on going it alone with executive orders that can't and won't fix these problems,\" he said in a statement.  \"The president's own executive orders have led directly to the humanitarian crisis along the southern border, giving false hope to children and their families that if they enter the country illegally they will be allowed to stay.\" \"\nU.S. Sen.  John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, added: \"Given the current crisis on the southern border, how can the president consider more pen and phone policy changes that will lead to another surge of illegal immigration and put more lives in danger?\"\nRepublicans have said White House policies like 2012's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has given some Central American families false hope about what awaits them after they enter the country.\n The policy grants certain undocumented immigrants a work permit and relief from deportation proceedings, but it only applies to those who have been in the country since 2007.\n Obama said the problem is that the current system is confusing and flawed.  And he reiterated that most of the children who have been apprehended on the border will likely be deported.\n \"The system is so broken, so unclear, that folks don't know what the rules are,\" he said.\n He added that his previous use of executive action has angered House Republicans, and said the solution to that is to pass legislation.  \"Pass a bill,\" he said, \"solve a problem.\" \"",

                    "body": "President Barack Obama brought together two of the GOP's favorite topics yesterday when he assailed House Speaker John Boehner for not acting on immigration reform and vowed to use whatever executive authority he had to push through administrative actions.\n Obama cited the new influx of unaccompanied minors from Central America as the latest humanitarian crisis on the border -- more than 1,000 refugee children are being housed in a Nogales detention center -- and said that he'd prefer a legislative solution, but after Boehner told him that immigration reform was dead in the House for the remainder of the year, he felt compelled to act.\n \"Here's what a year of obstruction has meant,\" Obama said.  \"It has meant fewer resources to strengthen our borders.  It's meant more businesses free to game the system by hiring undocumented workers, which punishes businesses that play by the rules, and drives down wages for hardworking Americans.  It's meant lost talent when the best and brightest from around the world come to study here but are forced to leave and then compete against our businesses and our workers.  It's meant no chance for 11 million immigrants to come out of the shadows and earn their citizenship if they pay a penalty and pass a background check, pay their fair share of taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line.  It's meant the heartbreak of separated families.\" \"\nYou can read his entire statement here, but here's the takeaway: Obama said he asked administration officials \"to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.  If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours.  I expect their recommendations before the end of summer and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay.\" \"\nExactly what those legal actions will be remains to seen, but Congressman Raul Grijalva (D-CD3) praised Obama for changing course after facing \"stonewalling\" from House Republicans.\n \"There are many options available to the president, from extending deferred action to all deserving family members to allowing for prosecutorial discretion on deportations,\" Grijalva said.  \"While the president's announcement today is a welcome first step, the success of this effort will depend largely on what comes next.  Sending more enforcement to our borders will do nothing for the men, women and children who are caught up in our broken system.  Nor will it provide a humanitarian solution to the crisis of child refugees arriving from Central America.\" \"\nCongressman Ron Barber (D-CD2) didn't weigh in on the merits of the executive action, but he did welcome $2 billion in assistance to deal with the unaccompanied minors who are flooding across the border.\n Barber said the current crisis demonstrated why the federal government needed to start reimbursing state and local governments for the additional burden that illegal immigration creates and stressed the need for more security for border residents.\n \"The safety and security of Southern Arizona communities must be given the highest priority as we implement plans to stop the flow of unaccompanied children and others coming to the United States illegally,\" Barber said in a prepared statement.  \"As I've said since day one, we must do this by putting more Border Patrol and other federal law enforcement personnel at the border.  Our Border Patrol agents must no longer be tasked with providing childcare to unaccompanied immigrant children.  They must be returned to their job of securing the border.\" \"\nRepublican Martha McSally, who narrowly lost to Barber in 2012 and wants a rematch this year, said that it was \"great to see that President Obama finally realizes what we here in Southern Arizona know all too well -- that the border is not secure.  Even though we have men and women serving in the Border Patrol who are doing the best they can, President Obama's Department of Homeland Security is directing a failed strategy, and it has been in his power and job description to devise a successful strategy for over six years, but he has failed.  Securing the border and reforming our legal immigration system so it is focused on economic growth must be the first priority.\" \"\nIn an earlier interview with the Weekly, McSally was critical of Obama's use of executive authority to allow DREAM Act kids to remain in the United States rather than be deported to their home country.  She has called the Senate's immigration-reform bill \"flawed\" but has generally shied away from taking a position on the future legal status of undocumented immigrants now in the United States, saying that a path to citizenship \"should be open to discussion.\" \"\nThat's an area where McSally and Barber disagree.  Barber supports the DREAM Act and a path to citizenship for undocumented people now in the country who can pass a background check, pay fines and back taxes and wait more than a decade for citizenship.\n Shelley Kais, who is facing McSally in the GOP primary, criticized Obama's use of executive authority.\n \"The Constitution does not give the president the power to ignore the law simply because of his political agenda or the perception of popular opinion,\" Kais said via email.\n U.S. Rep.  Ann Kirkpatrick (D-CD1) called on House leaders to allow a vote on immigration reform.\n Kirkpatrick said that the state \"has suffered from federal inaction to fix our broken immigration system.  But executive action can't fix it.  Piecemeal legislation can't fix it.  Congress must act -- and pass comprehensive immigration reform.  How many more emergencies will it take?  Arizona families want reform.  So do our small-business owners, chambers of commerce, educators, farmers and so many others.  A full year ago, the U.S. Senate, including Arizona Senators McCain and Flake, passed tough, fair, comprehensive reform.  It's inexcusable -- and downright pathetic -- that House leaders are stonewalling on an issue so important to our nation.\" \"\nThree Republicans are vying in the August primary for the chance to challenge Kirkpatrick in November: Arizona House Speaker Andy Tobin, state Rep.  Adam Kwasman and rancher Gary Kiehne.\n Tobin criticized Obama for deciding \"to circumvent the legislative branch of government and implement an executive order that will do nothing but continue to allow the flow of illegal immigrants across our border.\n \"I helped pass SB 1070 because Washington wasn't taking this problem seriously, and the president continues to play games,\" Tobin added in a prepared statement.  \"Obama clearly believes he's above the law.\" \"\nAsked for a response to Obama's comments, Kwasman took a shot at Tobin, who had previously told Capitol Media Services that he believed that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to remain in the United States as long as they registered with federal authorities and passed a background check.\n \"The best way to secure this border is by sending our national guard down there and finishing the double-layer fence,\" said Kwasman.  \"I've been endorsed by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, while Andy Tobin supports the Obama position of legal status for those who are here illegally.\" \"\nKwasman favors deporting all undocumented immigrants, including DREAM Act kids unless they are willing to serve in the military.\n Kiehne's campaign manager, Chris Baker, did not respond to a request for comment about Obama's comments regarding immigration.\n But in earlier interviews, Kiehne has said that he believes that as long as undocumented immigrants can pass a background check, they should be allowed to remain in the United States with a work permit, but not be allowed to pursue citizenship.",

Until Monday, Obama and leading Democrats held out hope that the reform would pass.\n Immigration reform is a major issue in November's congressional elections, with all 435 seats in the House and more than one-third of the 100 Senate seats on the ballot.\n Secretary of State John Kerry is to meet with Central American leaders Tuesday in Panama to discuss the child immigration issue.  Kerry will represent the US at the inauguration of Panama's president-elect, Juan Carlos Varela.\n Vice President Joe Biden was in Guatemala in June to meet with Central American leaders.  Most of the unaccompanied children making risky voyages are from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\n They must cross through Mexico to get to the US border.\n An estimated 11 million people are in the US illegally.  The stalled legislation would enable them to \"come out of the shadows\" and start the application process to become citizens, Obama said.\n Reform would improve security, boost tax revenues and increase the wages of undocumented workers, Obama said.\n Frustrated by partisan gridlock in Congress, Obama has used executive action a number of times, including his move in 2012 to enable people brought in to the US illegally as children to get work permits and to study.",

He wants to beef up border resources, but he's also vowing to use executive actions if Congress doesn't pass broader immigration reform.\n [Updated 4:30 p.m.] President Obama vowed Monday to take executive action on immigration to address the surge of immigrants flooding across the Texas border and to fill a void he says has been left by House Republicans' refusal to pass immigration reform.\n First, Mr. Obama will issue a directive to border authorities to move resources currently stationed in the US interior to the Mexico border.\n Obama also announced that he has asked Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to prepare recommendations for how further to use executive authority to address immigration.  He said he expects those recommendations by the end of the summer and that he will act on those recommendations immediately if Congress remains deadlocked on immigration reform.\n The announcement came on the same day that Obama also urged Congress to authorize a \"surge of resources\" - said to total $2 billion - to strengthen the Southwest border and to shelter and process the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who have flooded that border since October.\n In Monday's letter to congressional leaders, the president deemed the crisis an \"urgent humanitarian situation.\" \" He indicated that the emergency supplemental appropriation legislation would be used to support:\n\"This includes fulfilling our legal and moral obligation to make sure we appropriately care for unaccompanied children who are apprehended, while taking aggressive steps to surge resources to our Southwest border to deter both adults and children from this dangerous journey, increase capacity for enforcement and removal proceedings, and quickly return unlawful migrants to their home countries,\" Mr. Obama wrote.\n The additional measures could cost America an additional $2 billion, an anonymous White House official told Reuters on Sunday.\n In 2013, the government spent $3.5 billion on securing the border - more than double the amount spent in 2003 but $82 million less than the highest allocation, in 2011, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n Since October, more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been caught illegally crossing the Southwest border, twice the number apprehended during the same period a year ago, according to US Customs and Border Protection.  The Rio Grande Valley Sector along the Texas border with Mexico has experienced the heaviest flow of children, with more than 37,000 minors apprehended since October - nearly triple the number seen during the same period the year before.\n The southern Texas border patrol has been overwhelmed in managing the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children - mostly from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador - who have crossed the border since October 2013.\n Until the emergency designation of three military facilities as shelters for undocumented children this month, the US had only one detention facility for children and families, the Monitor's Mark Sappenfield reported Sunday.  This means that many families caught illegally crossing the border were released on their own recognizance until the backlogged courts could hear their case.\n Immigration advocates, already weary of Congress's unwillingness to pass comprehensive immigration reform, offered sharp criticism of the president's focus on expedition of deportations.\n \"President Obama is asking Congress to change the law to enable the government to inflict expedited removal on unaccompanied children.  That is simply unconscionable,\" Leslie Holman, incoming president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the Associated Press.  \"No matter what you call it, rapid deportations without any meaningful hearing for children who are rightly afraid of the violence and turmoil from which they fled is wrong, and contradicts the fundamental values of this nation.\" \"\nRepublicans, on the other hand, have been supportive of stricter border measures.  \"I think ... we have to be humanitarian at the same time - let them know that if they do come, they cannot stay here.  Otherwise, we'll never stop the flow,\" Rep.  Michael McCaul (R) of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"",

Maybe it will be next year.  Whenever it is, they will find me a willing partner.\" \"\nAcknowledging anger in Congress over the use of his executive action, the President said \"I don't prefer taking administrative action.  I'd rather see permanent fixes to the issue we face.\" \"\n\"Certainly that's true on immigration.  I've made that clear multiple times.  I would love nothing more than bipartisan legislation to pass the House, the Senate, land on my desk, so I can sign it,\" he said.  \"I take executive action only when we have a serious problem, a serious issue, and Congress chooses to do nothing.\" \"\nIt has been a year since the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with bipartisan support; Obama saying he \"held off on pressuring them (Republicans)\" to see if they could bring the legislation up for a vote, but that has not happened.\n \"There are enough Republicans and Democrats in the House to pass an immigration bill today, I would sign it into law today, and Washington would solve a problem in a bipartisan way,\" he said.  \"But for more than a year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have refused to allow an up-or-down vote on that Senate bill or any legislation to fix our broken immigration system.\" \"\n\"Our country and our economy would be stronger today if House Republicans had allowed a simple yes-or-no vote on this bill or, for that matter, any bill,\" he said.  \"Instead they've proven again and again that they're unwilling to stand up to the Tea Party in order to do what's best for the country.  And the worst part about it is, a bunch of them know better.\" \"\nThe Senate bill which passed with bipartisan support would mandate a beefing up of border security by an extra $30 billion before any of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can apply for citizenship, as well as a pathway to citizenship that includes paying back taxes, passing a background check, and learning English before going to the back of the line.\n \"There are a number of Republicans who have been willing to work with us to pass real common-sense immigration reform, and I want to thank them for their efforts,\" Obama said.\n Obama said he believes Speaker John Boehner wants to pass reform.\n \"I think he genuinely wants to get something done,\" he said.  \"But last week he informed me the Republicans will continue to block a vote on immigration reform at least for the remainder of this year.\" \"\nThroughout the past year leaders from religious organizations, business groups---like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, labor and law enforcement have all come together to voice their support for reform.  According to the last ABC News/Washington Post poll nearly 6 in 10 American support a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented.\n \"If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills.  Pass a bill.  Solve a problem.  Don't just say no on something that everybody agrees needs to be done,\" he said.  \"Because if we pass a bill, that will supplant whatever I've done administratively.  We'll have a structure there that works, and it will be permanent, and people can make plans and businesses can make plans based on the law, and there will be clarity, both here inside this country and outside it.\" \"",

                    "body": "El presidente Barack Obama dio este lunes por muerta la reforma del sistema de inmigraci\u00f3n, la iniciativa que deb\u00eda definir su segundo y \u00faltimo mandato en la Casa Blanca.\n Tras constatar que este a\u00f1o los republicanos se negar\u00edan a someter la ley a votaci\u00f3n en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, el dem\u00f3crata Obama dijo que optar\u00e1 por la v\u00eda del decreto para arreglar \"en lo que sea posible\" el sistema de inmigraci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan anunci\u00f3 en una comparecencia en el jard\u00edn de la Casa Blanca.  La declaraci\u00f3n tuvo la solemnidad de uno de los momentos graves de su presidencia.  Acompa\u00f1ado del vicepresidente Joe Biden, y en tono irritado, el presidente acus\u00f3 a los republicanos de bloquear un proyecto necesario por motivos econ\u00f3micos, humanos y de seguridad.\n La ley, adem\u00e1s de reforzar la frontera con M\u00e9xico, deb\u00eda ofrecer una v\u00eda a la regularizaci\u00f3n para los cerca de 11 millones de indocumentados -- la mayor\u00eda de origen latinoamericano -- que ahora viven en EE UU.  En junio de 2013 el Senado, de mayor\u00eda dem\u00f3crata, aprob\u00f3 una versi\u00f3n de la reforma con 68 votos a favor -- entre ellos los de destacados republicanos -- y 32 en contra.  Pero la reforma encall\u00f3 en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, de mayor\u00eda republicana.  Su presidente, el speaker John Boehner, se neg\u00f3 siquiera a permitir un voto, aunque la ley contaba con el apoyo de suficientes legisladores -- dem\u00f3cratas pero tambi\u00e9n algunos republicanos -- para aprobarse.\n Si la reforma sanitaria fue el proyecto estrella del primer mandato de Obama, la reforma migratoria lo era del segundo.  Ambas leyes eran proyectos ambiciosos destinados a definir el legado del presidente.  No ha sido el primero en intentarlo.  Su antecesor, el republicano George W. Bush tambi\u00e9n logr\u00f3 en 2006 que el Senado aprobase una reforma similar, pero aquella, como la actual, acab\u00f3 naufragando con la oposici\u00f3n de la derecha del Partido Republicano.\n Al dar por liquidada la reforma migratoria, Obama admite su impotencia ante un Congreso que, desde que 2011, ha bloqueado sus principales iniciativas.  Sin la reforma sanitaria, es improbable que en los dos a\u00f1os y medio que le quedan en la Casa Blanca el presidente firme otra ley se alcance parecido.  La promesa de actuar con decretos es un desaf\u00edo a la oposici\u00f3n republicana, que le acusa de abusar de este instrumento y de acaparar poderes presidenciales.\n Obama explic\u00f3 que la semana pasada Boehner le comunic\u00f3 que no habr\u00e1 un voto para la reforma en 2014.  El Congreso que salga de las elecciones legislativas de noviembre entrar\u00e1 en funciones en enero de 2016.  Ning\u00fan sondeo vaticina que los dem\u00f3cratas de Obama recuperen la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, la \u00fanica v\u00eda que permitir\u00eda una reforma en los t\u00e9rminos que desea el presidente.\n El fracaso de la reforma migratoria no es una sorpresa.  El bloqueo sistem\u00e1tico del Partido Republicano en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes dejaba pocas dudas sobre su escasa viabilidad.  En el \u00faltimo mes las cosas se han complicado a\u00fan m\u00e1s.\n La derrota en unas elecciones primarias del l\u00edder de la mayor\u00eda republicana en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, Eric Cantor, se interpret\u00f3 como una se\u00f1al de que las bases conservadoras no tolerar\u00edan la menor tibieza de sus l\u00edderes respecto a la inmigraci\u00f3n: sin ser favorable a la reforma, Cantor no era uno de sus detractores m\u00e1s estridentes.\n La ola miles de menores procedentes de Centroam\u00e9rica disip\u00f3 cualquier esperanza.  Algunos republicanos del Congreso ven en la llegada de decenas de miles de inmigrantes una respuesta al efecto llamada que suponen las promesas de regularizaci\u00f3n y acceso a la ciudadan\u00eda de la ley.  Para Obama el problema actual es fruto del desbarajuste de la actual legislaci\u00f3n, que tolera la presencia de indocumentados sin permitirles una plena integraci\u00f3n en el pa\u00eds.\n La renuncia a la ley de inmigraci\u00f3n representa una derrota de Obama, convertido en un pato cojo: en la jerga pol\u00edtica de EE UU, el presidente que, en el \u00faltimo tramo del mandato, ha dejado de influir.\n El coste para los republicanos no es inmediato.  En las elecciones legislativas el votante hispano participa poco, pero en las presidenciales su voto puede ser decisivo.  As\u00ed ocurri\u00f3 en 2012, cuando Obama se llev\u00f3 el 73% del voto de los latinos, la minor\u00eda m\u00e1s pujante.  Y s\u00ed puede volver a ocurrir en 2016, cuando se elija al sucesor de Obama: quien tenga en contra a los latinos lo tendr\u00e1 m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil para ganar.",

La solicitud de fondos les ofrece la capacidad de votar de inmediato para conseguirla\", dijo en una conferencia de prensa Obama.\n La visita de Obama a Texas ha suscitado cr\u00edticas de republicanos y activistas por la decisi\u00f3n del mandatario de no visitar la zona del valle de R\u00edo Grande en la frontera, por donde cruza la mayor\u00eda de los ni\u00f1os indocumentados que llegan solos.\n \"No hay nada que est\u00e9 ocurriendo en la frontera de lo que yo no est\u00e9 \u00edntimamente al tanto\", asegur\u00f3 el mi\u00e9rcoles Obama al respecto.\n \"Esto no es un teatro.
