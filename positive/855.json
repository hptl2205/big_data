                    "body": "President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has today fired his deputy after accusing her of 'plotting to kill him' following a three-month 'campaign' against her led by his wife.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the government, Mr Mugabe fired Joice Mujuru, 59, and eight other Cabinet ministers aligned with her, accusing them of corruption.\n\nMrs Mujuru had been tipped as the person most likely to succeed Mr Mugabe until his second wife, Grace, launched a three-month campaign against her and accused her of being too 'dull' and 'corrupt' to lead the party.\n\nMr Mugabe, 90, has now accused Mrs Mujuru of plotting to assassinate him and branded her 'a witch'.\n\nExperts say the First Lady is now being groomed to succeed her husband, following her appointment as leader of the women's wing of Zanu-PF last week.\n\nMrs Mugabe, 49, had repeatedly accused Mrs Mujuru of plotting against her husband.\n\nOnce working as her husband's secretary, in the last few months she has risen to the position of senior party figure.\n\nMrs Mujuru's sacking came following weeks of accusations that she had led a 'treacherous cabal' to try to unseat Mugabe, according toAl Jazeera.\n\nThe sacked officials received their dismissal letters on Monday night the Reuters news agency has reported.\n\nMrs Mujuru and her allies were also fired from their senior positions in the ruling party, Zanu-PF, at a meeting last weekend.\n\nA statement issued by the cabinet secretary on behalf of Mr Mugabe said: 'It had become evident that her conduct in the discharge of her duties had become inconsistent with the expected standard, exhibiting conflict between official responsibilities and private interests.'\n\nThe president said he would, however, allow them to retain ordinary membership of the party.\n\nMr Mugabe has also accused Mrs Mujuru of holding secret meetings at the U.S. Embassy in Harare.\n\nMrs Mujuru has denied the claims, calling them 'ridiculous' in her first public statement, released a day before she was fired.\n\n'I have become the fly in a web of lies whose final objective is the destruction of Zanu-PF,' Mrs Mujuru said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n'A vociferous attempt has been made to portray me as \"a traitor\", \"murderer\" and \"sellout\", yet no iota of evidence has been produced to give credence to the allegations.'\n\nIn her statement Mrs Mujuru said her loyalty to Mr Mugabe was 'unquestionable' and it was 'repugnant' to suggest she had plotted to kill him or wanted to remove Mr Mugabe from office.\n\nShe said Zimbabwe's state media had 'continued to publish malicious untruths' about her.\n\nBut correspondents say her career ran into trouble when Mr Mugabe's wife entered politics earlier this year.\n\nMrs Mujuru, who has been a member of Mr Mugabe's cabinet since he became president in 1980, said no evidence has ever been brought against her.\n\nMrs Mujuru is the first vice president to be fired since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980.\n\nHer four predecessors all died in office.\n\nThe ministers of energy, education, public service and social welfare, presidential affairs, communication and postal services are among the other members of Cabinet who were fired.\n\nThere has not yet been any announcements relating to replacements.\n\nAFP news agency has reported Mrs Mujuru has blamed 'a well-orchestrated smear campaign and gross abuse of state apparatus' that led to the loss of her ruling party post.\n\nShe said she was being victimised after exposing infiltrators conspiring to destroy the party, which has ruled the country since independence in 1980.\n\nZanu-PF held an elective congress last week which endorsed Mugabe as president and his wife as head of the women's wing.",

                    "body": "HARARE: Zimbabwe's vice president, once seen as Robert Mugabe's heir apparent, has been fired along with eight cabinet allies, the government said Tuesday (Dec 9) as the veteran leader purged his foes.\n\nAs the elderly head of state sought to quell infighting over his successor, the chief secretary to the cabinet, Misheck Sibanda, said in a terse statement that Joice Mujuru had been fired. Also sacked were her allies in the ministries of energy, public service, and half a dozen other departments, he said.\n\nThe move caps a long campaign by Mugabe and his closest lieutenants to isolate the 59-year-old Mujuru, a former guerrilla fighter, and her supporters. She has come more and more under attack, notably from 90-year-old Mugabe's increasingly powerful wife Grace. Critics have accused Mujuru of plotting to assassinate the president and of dodgy business dealings.\n\n\"It has become evident that her conduct in the discharge of her duties had become inconsistent with the expected standard,\" Sibanda said in the statement. He also blamed Mujuru for \"conflict between official responsibilities and private interests\".\n\nMujuru furiously rejected the allegations, saying she had become \"the fly in the web of lies\" and adding \"no iota of evidence\" had been produced against her. The public battle with Mujuru has put 68-year-old Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa firmly in top position to replace Mugabe. Mnangagwa is seen as a hardliner who in the past controlled the secret police and military.\n\nSome cite another possible candidate as Grace Mugabe, who has also been called \"Gucci Grace\" and \"First Shopper\". The reports came after the ruling ZANU-PF party last week met for a closely watched congress to elect its officials, finally endorsing Mugabe as president and the 49-year-old Grace as head of the party's women's wing.\n\nAfter her surprise nomination for the powerful post in August, Grace immediately launched a sustained campaign against Mujuru, accusing her of corruption and plotting to topple her husband. Mujuru's ouster shook Zimbabwean politics.\n\n\"This will leave ZANU-PF severely weakened,\" said Charles Mangogera of Porterhill Research. \"Those who have been sacked are people with a significant social base. They are no pushovers. They are people with a significant following.\" He added: \"If elections were called today you would be 100 percent guaranteed that ZANU-PF would lose.\"\n\n'FLY IN A WEB OF LIES'\n\nMujuru said she was being victimised after exposing infiltrators conspiring to destroy the party, which has ruled the country since independence in 1980.\n\n\"I have become the fly in the web of lies whose final objective is the destruction of ZANU-PF and what it stands for and ultimately the present government,\" Mujuru said in a statement. \"A vociferous attempt has been made to portray me as 'a traitor', 'murderer' and 'sellout', yet no iota of evidence has been produced to give credence to the allegations.\"\n\nMujuru earlier Tuesday blamed \"a well-orchestrated smear campaign and gross abuse of state apparatus\" for the loss last week of her powerful position on ZANU-PF's central committee. Mangogera said Mujuru may choose to push back against the allegations.\n\n\"From her statements, one can sense she will launch a legal fight,\" he said. \"She will certainly not take it lying down.\" ZANU-PF has been riven by factionalism over Mugabe's succession, but in the past party leaders managed to paper over the cracks.\n\nMujuru did not attend last week's party congress following threats against her and her sympathisers by members of the party's youth league. \"I decided to stay away from inevitable public humiliation as was meted out to other unfortunate members of the party,\" she said. \"It was important to maintain the dignity of the office of the vice president even in the face of such unwarranted violence by a section of the party membership.\"\n\nWhen he appointed Mujuru vice president in 2004, Mugabe, who has refused to name his successor, hinted that she was destined for higher office. Mujuru is a former guerrilla fighter and widow of the country's first black army chief, who had held cabinet posts in every Mugabe government since independence in 1980.",

EFE/Archivo\n\nEl presidente de Zimbabue, Robert Mugabe, ha destituido a la vicepresidenta del pa\u00eds y a otros ocho ministros tras acusarles de conspirar para matarle y llevar a cabo un golpe de Estado.\n\nEl casi centenario presidente zimbabuense efectu\u00f3 anoche la expulsi\u00f3n aclarando en un comunicado que la conducta de la vicepresidenta, Joice Mujuru, \"ha sido incompatible con el est\u00e1ndar esperado\".\n\nMedios estatales se\u00f1alaron hoy que la decisi\u00f3n de expulsar a la vicepresidenta y sus ministros aliados era \"moralmente correcta\", aunque Mujuru defendi\u00f3 su actuaci\u00f3n en el cargo y rechaz\u00f3 las acusaciones por \"rid\u00edculas\".\n\n\"Es un intento de retratarme como un traidora y una asesina, pero no se ha aportado ni un solo \u00e1pice de evidencia para dar cr\u00e9dito a las acusaciones\", afirm\u00f3.\n\nMujuru se\u00f1al\u00f3 adem\u00e1s que su destituci\u00f3n y la de sus aliados pol\u00edticos se ha llevado a cabo \"a trav\u00e9s de medios il\u00edcitos o ilegales\".\n\nHasta hace dos meses, Mujuru era la candidata mejor posicionada para suceder al presidente, pero desde entonces ha sido objeto de una campa\u00f1a de desprestigio liderada por la esposa de Mugabe, que acaba de ser nombrada nueva l\u00edder de la Liga de mujeres del partido gubernamental.\n\nGrace Mugabe se perfila ahora como sucesora del actual presidente, que con 90 a\u00f1os de edad, 35 de ellos en el poder, y un delicado estado de salud, podr\u00eda estar pensando en dejar paso a un nuevo jefe de Estado.\n\nSeg\u00fan analistas del pa\u00eds, Mujuru hab\u00eda adquirido demasiada popularidad dentro del partido, por lo que Mugabe tem\u00eda que pudiera desbancarlo.\n\nLa Constituci\u00f3n de Zimbabue permite que ejerzan el cargo a la vez dos vicepresidentes, que ser\u00e1n anunciados esta misma semana.",

Darle un poder a los medios comunitarios para que el Gobierno les venda publicidad pero tienen que publicar lo que ellos (Gobierno) quieren\".\n\nLa representante del CNP en Ciudad Guayana destaca que \"para cualquier profesi\u00f3n debe existir una preparaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica\", recordando que en Venezuela ya no cabe el empirismo, pues cada vez hay m\u00e1s oportunidades para ingresar a una universidad; esto a prop\u00f3sito de la Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social, la cual pretend\u00eda desprofesionalizar el ejercicio del periodismo.\n\nFerreira recuerda que no es la primera vez que el gremio se enfrenta a este tipo de intentos de desconocimiento a la preparaci\u00f3n acad\u00e9mica que requieren para ser licenciados en Comunicaci\u00f3n Social, como ocurri\u00f3 con la certificaci\u00f3n de Producci\u00f3n Nacional Independiente (PNI), que \"era para d\u00e1rselas a personas que tuvieran experiencia como productores, y quisieron meterla en los medios comunitarios\".\n\n\"La ley busca desprofesionalizar nuestra carrera\", insiste la secretaria general del CNP, considerando dicho proyecto como un retroceso.\n\nAcallar la cr\u00edtica\n\nPese a los comunicados p\u00fablicos que ha hecho el CNP, Ferreira recalca que no ha sido posible concretar una reuni\u00f3n con la Comisi\u00f3n Permanente del Poder Popular y Medios de Comunicaci\u00f3n de la Asamblea Nacional, para que las partes expresen sus argumentos.\n\nEl presidente del CNP, Tinedo Gu\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n hizo p\u00fablico su rechazo a esta Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n Popular, alegando que es una forma para que el Gobierno controle y promueva a trav\u00e9s del financiamiento todo lo que se difunda por los medios comunitarios, ya que estar\u00edan subordinados a la creaci\u00f3n del Consejo Nacional de Comunicaci\u00f3n Popular, \u00f3rgano adscrito a la vicepresidente de la Rep\u00fablica.\n\n\"El gobierno busca ampliar su base de propaganda y controlar los medios comunitarios y garantizar que todo cuanto se diga provenga de la l\u00ednea dictada por el Ejecutivo nacional. Es decir, acallar cualquier opini\u00f3n o disidencia\", dijo Gu\u00eda recientemente en un encuentro con los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl diputado Biagio Pillieri, miembro de la Comisi\u00f3n Permanente del Poder Popular y Medios de Comunicaci\u00f3n de la Asamblea Nacional, precis\u00f3 que en lo que respecta a la Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social, esta \"atenta contra la profesionalizaci\u00f3n del periodismo, y al atentar contra \u00e9l, tambi\u00e9n lo hace contra la calidad de informaci\u00f3n. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de defender si se es licenciado o no es preservar la calidad informativa que es buscar la verdad\".\n\nLa Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social, consignada por el periodista Gast\u00f3n Guisandes, no fue admitida por no cumplir con las exigencias requeridas y como fue presentada, lo que hace presumir que sea engavetada, aunque no se descarta que el Gobierno busque los mecanismos para anexarla a la agenda parlamentaria.\n\nIntensificar el rechazo\n\nEn el caso de la Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n para el Poder Popular, el diputado coincide con el gremio period\u00edstico al referirse a que su objetivo es \"el control total y absoluto de los medios comunitarios alternativos\", acotando la subordinaci\u00f3n a la Vicepresidencia de la Rep\u00fablica al crearse el Consejo Nacional de Comunicaci\u00f3n Popular, el cual manejar\u00e1 el fondo para el Desarrollo de la Comunicaci\u00f3n del Poder Popular.\n\n\"Adem\u00e1s, autoriza, certifica y aprueba los medios comunitarios que funcionar\u00e1n o no\", agreg\u00f3 Pillieri. Frente a las preocupaciones que han expresado las autoridades del CNE, el parlamentario lament\u00f3 que diputados del sector oficial intenten eludir y menospreciar, mientras que \"el Gobierno insiste en avanzar en la hegemon\u00eda comunicacional\".\n\nPillieri inst\u00f3 a alzar la voz de protesta, considerando que frente a los movimientos de rechazo es probable que al final el proyecto no sea aprobado, como sucedi\u00f3 con la propuesta de Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n Social.\n\nActualizar Ley de Periodismo\n\nLa secretaria general delColegio Nacional de Periodistas, seccional Ciudad Guayana, Ang\u00e9lica Ferreira resalt\u00f3 que as\u00ed como es cr\u00edtica del proyecto de Ley de Comunicaci\u00f3n para el Poder Popular, tambi\u00e9n lo hace con la actual ley de Ejercicio del Periodismo.\n\nConsidera que esta \u00faltima requiere de unaactualizaci\u00f3n. \"No hemos incluido a las redes sociales, y eso tiene tiempo... ya existe la Community Manager como ejercicio del periodista\", se\u00f1al\u00f3 Ferreira.",
