Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner who is a leading foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was found guilty of fraud and given a suspended sentence of three and a half years on Tuesday.\n\nMOSCOW Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner who is a leading foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was found guilty of fraud and given a suspended sentence of three and a half years on Tuesday, while his brother was sent to prison.\n\nThe verdict was scheduled for next month, but the court session was abruptly moved forward to the day before New Year's Eve, the main holiday in Russia, leading to speculation that authorities wanted to head off protests.\n\nNonetheless, more than 18,000 people have said on Facebook they will take part in a protest Tuesday evening near the Kremlin. Alexei Mayorov, a security official in the Moscow mayor's office, said any attempt at a rally would be shut down because it has not been sanctioned, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nNavalny and his younger brother Oleg were convicted of defrauding a French cosmetics company and given the same sentence as each other, but Oleg's was not suspended. The court also fined each of them 500,000 rubles (about $8,800) and ordered them to pay some 4 million rubles ($77,000) in damages.\n\nOleg Navalny, the father of two small children and a former executive of the state-owned postal service, has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement and his imprisonment could echo the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of inconvenient people.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing? You want to punish me even harder?\" Alexei Navalny shouted out as Judge Yelena Korobchenko handed down the sentence for his brother.\n\nAlexei briefly entered the metal cage that his brother was put into after the verdict and appeared to be holding back tears.\n\n\"This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,\" Alexei Navalny said outside the court.\n\n\"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents -- we're used to it; we're aware that they're doing it -- but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,\" he said, and called for people to attend the protest on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe suspended sentence means that it could be converted into a prison term at any time, by court order, in the event that Navalny offends again.\n\nNavalny has been under house arrest since February and his lawyer Vadim Kobzev told The Associated Press that he will remain there until all appeals by either side are exhausted, which could take months.\n\nIndependent Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman said the verdict is a message to the entire Russian opposition: \"All of you guys are at our mercy.\"\n\nLipman said it was clear the Kremlin had decided not to make a martyr out of Navalny, with the aim \"not to consolidate the opposition, but to demoralize and intimidate it.\"\n\nThe trial seemed to be full of inconsistencies and loopholes.\n\nThe company involved, Yves Rocher, wrote a complaint to investigators about the Navalny brothers' firm, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. The French executive who wrote the complaint also left Russia shortly afterward and never attended the hearings.\n\nThe prosecutors insisted that the brothers forced the company \"into disadvantageous contracts\" and defrauded it of 26 million rubles (about $440,000).\n\nThe brothers had both arrived at the courtroom with luggage, indicating they expected to be immediately imprisoned.\n\nNavalny, a lawyer and popular blogger, rose to prominence with his investigations of official corruption and played a leading role in organizing massive anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn a 2013 trial in a different criminal case, he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013.\n\nThe verdict and sentencing add to anxiety over the Russian economy's plunge this year. By late afternoon, the Russian benchmark index MICEX was down about 2 percent\n\nRussian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky who spent 10 years in jail before he was pardoned last year dismissed the verdict as Putin's revenge for Navalny's activism.\n\nKhodorkovsky said in a statement that he is \"not even surprised that Putin and his entourage are capable of vile tricks, deception, forgery and manipulation -- they are not capable of anything else.\"\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message \"to independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015.\"\n\nStill, some Russian officials suggested the sentence was too light and should be appealed by prosecutors, which is permitted under Russian law. Mikhail Markelov, a prominent parliament member from the United Russia party that is Putin's power base, told the news agency Tass that \"everything should be done to achieve reconsideration of this sentence.\"\n\nAlthough Alexei Navalny is prominent within Russia's big-city Western-oriented circles, his visibility and reputation are much lower in the country as a whole.",

The court also fined each of them 500,000 rubles (about $8,800) and ordered them to pay some 4 million rubles ($77,000) in damages.\n\nOleg Navalny has been far less prominent than his brother and his going to prison could echo the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of inconvenient people.\n\n\"This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,\" Alexei said outside the court.\n\n\"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents - we're used to it, we're aware that they're doing it - but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,\" he said, and called for protesters to come out to the streets.\n\n\"The sentencing and the imprisoning of his brother Oleg Navalny seems aimed not only at punishing Alexei Navalny himself and stopping his anti-corruption work but also intimidating other critics of the government,\" said Hugh Williamson of Human Rights watch in a statement. \"The Kremlin seems to be telling independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015,\"\n\nStill, some Russian officials suggested the sentence was too light and should be appealed by prosecutors, which is permitted under Russian law. Mikhail Markelov, a prominent parliament member from the United Russia party that is Putin's power base, told the news agency Tass that \"everything should be done to achieve reconsideration of this sentence.\"\n\nThe brothers had both arrived at the courtroom with luggage, indicating they expected to be immediately imprisoned.\n\nNavalny, a lawyer and popular blogger, rose to prominence with his investigations of official corruption and played a leading role in organizing massive anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn a 2013 trial in a different criminal case, he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013.\n\nAt the conclusion of testimony in the latest trial, prosecutors asked for a 10-year sentence for Navalny. It was not immediately clear why the court chose the shorter term or why it was suspended, but that could reflect official concern about the prospect of unrest.\n\nMore than 16,000 people have said on Facebook that they will attend an unsanctioned protest called for Tuesday evening in Manezh Square adjacent to the Kremlin. The provocateur group Pussy Riot released a video Tuesday supporting the protest, featuring women sweeping snow from the square with brooms and then mounting them and flying off as witches.\n\nAlexei Navalny remains under house arrest until his appeals process is exhausted.\n\nThe verdict and sentencing adds to anxiety over the Russian economy's plunge this year. At midday, the Russian stock indexes were down about 2.5 percent.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

                    "body": "Thousands protest conviction of Putin critic and his brother\n\nPolice have pushed demonstrators away from a square just outside the Kremlin.\n\nThe unsanctioned demonstration on Tuesday came hours after Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and the chief foe of President Vladimir Putin, was found guilty of fraud and given a suspended sentence of 3 \u00bd years. His brother was sent to prison.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nThe convictions are widely seen as a political vendetta by Putin.\n\nPolice allowed the protest in Moscow to proceed for about two hours, then moved in to push protesters away from the site.\n\nNavalny, who has been under house arrest since February, broke its terms to attend the rally and was rounded up by police as he approached the site of the protest. Navalny later tweeted that police drove him home and blocked him from leaving his apartment.\n\nThe protesters, who gathered on the square, chanted: ''We are the power!'' and ''You won't be able to jail us all!'' Some shouted slogans of support for Ukraine, which saw its Crimean Peninsula annexed by Russia in March and has faced a pro-Russia insurgency in the east.\n\nAlexei Mayorov, a security official in the Moscow mayor's office, had warned that any attempt to hold a rally would be quickly blocked.\n\nPolice, which have deployed in force around the central Manezh Square, rounded up some of the protesters and urged others to leave, but didn't immediately move in to break up the demonstration.\n\nThe rally has remained peaceful, despite some minor scuffles that erupted between Putin's supporters and the demonstrators.\n\nRussian law requires demonstrators to receive official clearance for their actions and can impose heavy fines and prison sentences for those who disobey.\n\nThe provocateur punk group Pussy Riot had released a video supporting Tuesday's demonstration, featuring four stylishly dressed women sweeping snow from the square, then mounting their brooms and flying off as witches across the Kremlin wall in a performance symbolizing protest.\n\nTwo of the performers, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, spent nearly two years in prison on charges of hooliganism for mounting an anti-Putin protest in Moscow's main cathedral in 2012, and won global fame.\n\nTuesday's verdict had been scheduled for next month, but the court session was abruptly moved forward to the day before New Year's Eve, the main holiday in Russia, in what was widely seen as an attempt to head off protests. Russia's main nationwide state-controlled television stations refrained from reporting the verdict.\n\nA European Union spokeswoman said the charges against the Navalny brothers hadn't been substantiated during trial and that the guilty verdict against them ''appeared to be politically motivated.''\n\n''With the exception of a few selected representatives of the media, no public and international observers were allowed into the court building for the reading of the verdict,'' EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said in a statement in Brussels.\n\n''The EU stresses the importance of judicial decisions to be free from political interference, independent, and in full compliance with the rule of law,'' she said.\n\nNavalny and his younger brother Oleg were convicted of defrauding a French cosmetics company and given the same 3 \u00bd year sentence, but Oleg's was not suspended. The court also fined each of them 500,000 rubles (about $8,800) and ordered them to pay some 4 million rubles ($77,000) in damages.\n\nOleg Navalny, the father of two small children and a former executive of the state-owned postal service, has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement and his imprisonment could echo the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of inconvenient people.\n\n''Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing? You want to punish me even harder?'' Alexei Navalny shouted out as Judge Yelena Korobchenko handed down the sentence for his brother on Monday.\n\nHe briefly entered the metal cage that his brother was put into after the verdict and appeared to be holding back tears.\n\n''This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,'' Alexei Navalny said outside the court.\n\n''The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents -- we're used to it; we're aware that they're doing it -- but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,'' he said, and called for people to attend the protest on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe suspended sentence means that it could be converted into a prison term at any time, by court order, in the event that Navalny offends again.\n\nHe has been under house arrest since February, and his lawyer Vadim Kobzev told The Associated Press that he will remain there until all appeals by either side are exhausted, which could take months.\n\nIndependent Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman said the verdict is a message to the entire Russian opposition: ''All of you guys are at our mercy.''\n\nLipman said it was clear the Kremlin had decided not to make a martyr out of Navalny, with the aim ''not to consolidate the opposition, but to demoralize and intimidate it.''\n\nThe trial seemed to be full of inconsistencies and loopholes.\n\nThe company involved, Yves Rocher, wrote a complaint to investigators about the Navalny brothers' firm, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. The French executive who wrote the complaint also left Russia shortly afterward and never attended the hearings.\n\nThe prosecutors insisted that the brothers forced the company ''into disadvantageous contracts'' and defrauded it of 26 million rubles (about $440,000).\n\nThe brothers had both arrived at the courtroom with luggage, indicating they expected to be immediately imprisoned.\n\nNavalny, a lawyer and popular blogger, rose to prominence with his investigations of official corruption and played a leading role in organizing massive anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn a 2013 trial in a different criminal case, he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013.\n\nThe verdict and sentencing add to anxiety over the Russian economy's plunge this year.\n\nRussian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky who spent 10 years in jail before he was pardoned last year dismissed the verdict as Putin's revenge for Navalny's activism.\n\nKhodorkovsky said in a statement that he is ''not even surprised that Putin and his entourage are capable of vile tricks, deception, forgery and manipulation -- they are not capable of anything else.''\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message ''to independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015.''\n\nAnton Belitskiy/REUTERS\n\nAlexei Navalny, who has been under house arrest since February, broke its terms to attend the rally and was rounded up by police as he approached the site of the protest.\n\nJim Heintz and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow and John-Thor Dahlburg in Brussels contributed to this report.",

The Kremlin denies allegations that it uses the courts to persecute opponents.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko.\n\n\"Why are you putting him (my brother Oleg) in prison? To punish me even harder?\" Navalny said.\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which critics also called a sham.\n\nThere had been fears that a jail sentence for Navalny would lead to rising tensions on the streets of Moscow. His supporters have promised to hold a protest on the Manezh Square in front of the Kremlin on Tuesday evening.\n\nOvanes Oganisyan, a strategist at investment consultancy firm MidLincoln Research, said that \"protests\" are likely with Navalny expected to be very \"energetic and aggressive\" in pursuing freedom for his brother.\n\nHowever, Oganisyan believes the decision is a \"win, win\" with the suspended sentence meaning Navalny will escape jail but will have to adhere to a probationary period.\n\n\"It's a win for (the) opposition, and for (the) presidential administration as well,\" Oganisyan said in a morning note after the news.\n\nThe decision means that more escalation on the political front will now be abandoned, he said, adding that this means less risk for the Russian administration going forward.\n\n\"Russia will face more obstacles ahead year,\" he said, but believes that the year is ending on a \"positive note\" for Russia.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @CNBCWorld",

Prosecutors had asked for Alexei Navalny to be given a 10-year prison sentence and Oleg to receive an eight-year term.\n\nA corruption-fighting lawyer, Alexei Navalny famously branded the ruling United Russia party -- founded by President Vladimir Putin -- \"the party of crooks and thieves.\"\n\nHe was a prominent organizer of mass street protests three years ago and has attacked corruption in Russian government, using his blog and social media.\n\nBefore Tuesday's ruling he was under house arrest after he was convicted last year of misappropriating $500,000 worth of state-owned timber, in what he told CNN was a fabricated case.\n\nRecommended",

But his brother, Oleg, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison.\n\nWith opposition leaders saying jailing Mr. Navalny would trigger widespread anti-government protests, targeting his family instead was seen as a strategic move to avoid making a martyr of him. \"This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,\" Alexei Navalny said outside the court. \"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents - we're used to it, we're aware that they're doing it - but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them.\"\n\nA lawyer and popular blogger, the 38-year-old Mr. Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation have been outspoken critics of the government. The foundation compiled online records alleging corruption that contributed to the runaway cost of this year's Sochi Olympics.\n\nFrom the archives: Construction, corruption and controversy in the Sochi that Putin built\n\nMr. Navalny played a leading role in organizing anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012, which were among the biggest Russia had seen in nearly 20 years.\n\nFrom the archives: Russia's opposition unites in massive anti-Putin protest\n\nNo, nor is it the first time a court has restrained itself from sentencing him. In a 2013 trial in a different criminal case, he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September, 2013.\n\nAlexei and Oleg Navalny were convicted of defrauding a French cosmetics company, Yves Rocher, by forcing it into \"disadvantageous contracts.\"\n\nYves Rocher wrote a complaint to investigators, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. The French executive who wrote the complaint also left Russia shortly afterward and never attended the hearings.\n\nBoth Navalny brothers received the same prison sentence, but whereas Alexei's sentence was suspended, Oleg's was not. Both brothers have also been fined 500,000 rubles and were ordered to pay four million in damages.\n\nMr. Navalny's sentencing had originally been scheduled for next month, but was abruptly moved to the day before New Year's Eve, Russia's main holiday. The change in timing risks diminishing turnout for protests against Mr. Navalny's sentence.\n\nThe suspended sentence means that it could be converted into a prison term at any moment if Alexei Navalny offends again, although this will be still up to the court to decide.\n\nMr. Navalny's supporters are expected to rally outside the Kremlin later Tuesday to protest against the sentencing decision. Authorities have not authorized the rally, so there may be arrests.",

It has been speculated that the authorities wished to minimise the risk of protests.\n\nAlexei Navalny and his brother Oleg were both convicted of defrauding a French cosmetics company and were handed the same sentence, but the more prominent Mr Navalny's sentence was suspended.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing? You want to punish me even harder?\" Alexei Navalny shouted as Judge Yelena Korobchenko passed the sentence on his brother.\n\nBoth brothers were also fined 500,000 roubles (\u00a35,700) and ordered to pay 4 million roubles (\u00a346,000) in damages.\n\n\"This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,\" Alexei Navalny said outside the court.\n\n\"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents -- we're used to it, we're aware that they're doing it -- but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,\" he said, and called for a protest Tuesday evening.\n\nMore than 30,000 people had joined a Facebook group that had planned to rally against the trial outside the Kremlin.\n\nIt is claimed that Oleg Navalny, the father of two young children and a former postal executive, has never played a part in opposition movements and his imprisonment could herald a return to the Soviet-era practice of punishing relatives and those close to dissidents.\n\nThe suspended sentence means that Alexei Navalny could be incarcerated should he offend again. He has been under house arrest since February and will remain there until all appeals have been completed, according to his lawyer.\n\nMarsha Lipman, a Moscow-based political analyst, said that the verdict was a message to opposition groups: \"All of you guys are at our mercy.\"\n\nShe added that the Kremlin had decided not to make a martyr out of Alexei Navalny, but instead the aim was \"not to consolidate the opposition, but to demoralise and intimidate it\".\n\nYves Rocher, the French company implicated in the trial, had written a letter of complaint to prosecutors and insisted that no damages were applicable. But the French executive who wrote the initial letter has since left Russia and was not present at the trial.\n\nAlexei Navalny rose to prominence after investigating corruption inside the administration and was one of the leaders of anti-Putin protests in 2011 and 2012 in Moscow.\n\nHe was handed another suspended sentence in 2013 in a separate embezzlement case and in September of that year came second in the Moscow mayoral elections.",

They are specially trying to humiliate and torment the relatives of the people who are their political opponents.\"\n\nRussia's prosecutor had recommended a 10-year prison term for Alexei Navalny and an eight-year sentence for his brother -- the maximum sentence for the charge. However, although the judge found both men guilty, only Oleg Navalny will be jailed.\n\nAlexei Navalny, a lawyer and popular blogger, rose to prominence during massive street protests that swept Moscow in 2011 and early 2012 after a parliamentary election that critics charged was flawed.\n\nEven before the protests, Navalny had become a thorn in the Kremlin's side, blogging about high-level corruption in Russia.\n\nTuesday's verdict was the latest in a series of criminal cases against Navalny, which he believes have been fabricated by the Russian authorities to discredit and sideline a political opponent. Under Russian law convicted felons are barred from standing for public office.\n\nThe court had planned to rule in the current case after Russia celebrated the New Year holidays, but in a surprise move, the hearing was abruptly moved to Tuesday after thousands of Navalny's supporters pledged to stage a protest in Moscow on Jan. 15.\n\n\"By moving up the verdict, the Russian authorities apparently sought to diminish planned demonstrations,\" Human Rights Watch said in a statement Tuesday. \"They also pushed those planning to protest a guilty verdict to the margins of the law, by denying them enough time to comply with local regulations\" requiring police approval for large public gatherings.\n\nAlexei Navalny, who is already serving a five-year suspended sentence for the alleged theft of 16 million rubles (about $276,000) from a timber firm in 2009, was placed under house arrest in February. Terms of his confinement bar the activist from receiving visitors or posting messages on the Internet.\n\nWidely seen as the only member of the Russian opposition capable of mounting a significant challenge to President Vladimir Putin, Navalny last year took 27% of the votes in a Moscow's mayoral election, which was won by the Kremlin-backed incumbent, Sergei Sobyanin.\n\nAlthough visibly upset when the judge read out the verdict against his brother in court, Alexei Navalny pledged to continue to the opposition battle.\n\n\"The authorities don't deserve to exist. I call everybody to take to the streets,\" he said in a statement outside the courthouse.\n\nRussian authorities warned Tuesday that police would crack down on any unsanctioned protests in Moscow in the coming days.\n\nPussy Riot, the Russian female punk band, released a new video ahead of the planned protest that, although stopping short of calling people into the streets, flagged the time and place of Tuesday's unauthorized event, which was set to take place at 7 p.m. local time in Moscow's Manezh Square.\n\nIn the video, the band's best known members, Nadya Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, dress up as vampish witches before setting out to sweep Manezh Square of snow. The video ends when the two women fly off into the night on broomsticks.\n\nThe video song repeats the words, \"Clean, Honest, Word, Deed,\" as the date and time of the protest flashes over shots of the Kremlin towers flanking Manezh Square. Under Russian law, it is forbidden to publicly call for unauthorized demonstrations.\n\nTolokonnikova and Alekhina were jailed in 2012 for singing a raucous anti-Putin song in a Moscow cathedral, but were released last year after receiving an amnesty from the Russian president.",

Russia's main nationwide state-controlled television stations refrained from reporting the verdict.\n\nNavalny and his younger brother Oleg were convicted of defrauding a French cosmetics company and given the same sentence as each other, but Oleg's was not suspended. The court also fined each of them 500,000 rubles (about $8,800) and ordered them to pay some 4 million rubles ($77,000) in damages.\n\nOleg Navalny, the father of two small children and a former executive of the state-owned postal service, has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement and his imprisonment could echo the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of inconvenient people.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing? You want to punish me even harder?\" Alexei Navalny shouted out as Judge Yelena Korobchenko handed down the sentence for his brother.\n\nAlexei briefly entered the metal cage that his brother was put into after the verdict and appeared to be holding back tears.\n\n\"This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,\" Alexei Navalny said outside the court.\n\n\"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents -- we're used to it; we're aware that they're doing it -- but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,\" he said, and called for people to attend the protest on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe suspended sentence means that it could be converted into a prison term at any time, by court order, in the event that Navalny offends again.\n\nHe has been under house arrest since February, and his lawyer Vadim Kobzev told The Associated Press that he will remain there until all appeals by either side are exhausted, which could take months.\n\nIndependent Moscow-based political analyst Masha Lipman said the verdict is a message to the entire Russian opposition: \"All of you guys are at our mercy.\"\n\nLipman said it was clear the Kremlin had decided not to make a martyr out of Navalny, with the aim \"not to consolidate the opposition, but to demoralize and intimidate it.\"\n\nThe trial seemed to be full of inconsistencies and loopholes.\n\nThe company involved, Yves Rocher, wrote a complaint to investigators about the Navalny brothers' firm, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. The French executive who wrote the complaint also left Russia shortly afterward and never attended the hearings.\n\nThe prosecutors insisted that the brothers forced the company \"into disadvantageous contracts\" and defrauded it of 26 million rubles (about $440,000).\n\nThe brothers had both arrived at the courtroom with luggage, indicating they expected to be immediately imprisoned.\n\nNavalny, a lawyer and popular blogger, rose to prominence with his investigations of official corruption and played a leading role in organizing massive anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn a 2013 trial in a different criminal case, he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013.\n\nThe verdict and sentencing add to anxiety over the Russian economy's plunge this year. By Tuesday evening, the Russian benchmark index MICEX was down more than 2 percent\n\nRussian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky who spent 10 years in jail before he was pardoned last year dismissed the verdict as Putin's revenge for Navalny's activism.\n\nKhodorkovsky said in a statement that he is \"not even surprised that Putin and his entourage are capable of vile tricks, deception, forgery and manipulation -- they are not capable of anything else.\"\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message \"to independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015.\"\n\nStill, some members of the Kremlin-controlled parliament suggested the sentence was too light and should be appealed by prosecutors, which is permitted under Russian law. Mikhail Markelov, a leading lawmakers from the main Kremlin-controlled United Russia party, told the news agency Tass that \"everything should be done to achieve reconsideration of this sentence.\"",

                    "body": "MOSCOW -- Russian police detained a powerful opponent of President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday during a protest rally staged just hours after a court ordered the activist to remain under house arrest and jailed his brother.\n\nThe defiance of Alexei Navalny to attend the anti-Putin demonstration -- where crowds chanted against the Russian leader and his policies -- pointed to possible reinvigorated opposition at a time when Putin's image has suffered over issues such as a slumping economy.\n\n\"Russia without Putin,\" some cried as several thousand demonstrators filled Moscow's Manezh Square. Police were on alert, but did not intervene except to hustle away Navalny shortly after he arrived.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Navalny shouted \"shame\" in a Moscow courtroom after sentences were handed down after trial on fraud charges.\n\nBoth Navalny and his brother Oleg received three-and-a-half-year sentences. Navalny avoided prison with a suspended sentence, which required he continue his nearly year-long house arrest during appeals. But his brother was jailed -- a move Navalny decried as a pressure tactic by the Kremlin.\n\n\"Why are you putting him in jail, just to punish me even more?\" he yelled in court.\n\nSeveral hours later, defying house arrest, Navalny joined demonstrators shouting \"I am the brother of Navalny!\" and \"Free Russia!\"\n\nThe trial of Navalny and his brother -- charged with bilking a company using doctored shipping orders -- became a rallying point for Putin's opponents who claim the case was politically motived punishment.\n\nHis appearance at the demonstration, as temperatures dipped close to zero, was viewed as both a challenge of the court ruling and the wider reach of Putin's authority.\n\nIt was by no means the first time he has been detained at a protest. In the past, Navalny was generally released soon after, or at most several days later. But given the terms of his house arrest, authorities could take a harder line.\n\nIn a final argument before the court earlier this month, Navalny pledged that charges against \"hostages\" such as his brother \"will not stop me.\" But he now faces a dilemma: How hard to push against the Kremlin without putting his brother at further possible risk.\n\nNavalny's anti-corruption movement has long been a thorn in Putin's side. Navalny led mass anti-Putin protests in 2011 and 2012 and made a strong showing against the Kremlin's hand-picked candidate in the 2013 Moscow mayoral race.\n\nNavalny's verdict was expected in mid-January, but it was abruptly rescheduled to before New Year's Eve -- the biggest holiday of the year in Russia, and the start of an extended national holiday period during which many people leave Moscow.\n\nIn 2013, when a court found Navalny guilty of embezzlement in a different case involving a timber company, authorities released him from prison after just one day following large protests in Moscow. He placed second in the Moscow mayor's race just a few months later.\n\nIn the current case, Navalny and his brother were accused of defrauding a cosmetics company out of $800,000 through fake shipping bills. Prosecutors have sought a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, and Navalny has been under house arrest since February\n\nIn the past year, anti-government protesters have confronted increasing pressures in Russia, which deepened its involvement in Ukraine's conflict and faced growing tensions with the West. But to some Kremlin critics, the falling price of oil and the plunge of the Russian ruble raised the possibility that Putin's grip on power might be weakening.\n\nYet Tuesday's verdict demonstrated the unpredictable nature of how justice can be meted against political opposition figures in Russia.\n\nAround this time last year, Putin pardoned and released former oil tycoon and outspoken Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky after a decade-long imprisonment. After his release, Khodorkovsky said he considered Putin \"a political opponent, not an enemy\" because \"he didn't touch my family.\"",

                    "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court gave Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny a suspended sentence on Tuesday for embezzling money but jailed his brother for three and a half years in a case seen as part of a campaign to stifle dissent.\n\nAs hundreds of his supporters gathered in front of the Kremlin, Navalny broke house arrest to join the rally but was swiftly detained and driven back home by police.\n\nNavalny led mass protests against President Vladimir Putin three years ago, when tens of thousands took to the streets in Moscow and St Petersburg to protest against corruption in his government and inner circle.\n\nOpposition figures say jailing Navalny risked a new wave of protests so he was being punished through his brother instead. The EU said the verdict appeared to be politically motivated and a German official said the ruling was a blow to civil society.\n\nThe Navalny brothers, Alexei and Oleg, were accused of stealing 30 million roubles, around $500,000 (321,277 pounds) at the current exchange rate, from two firms including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012.\n\nTuesday's ruling will come as a relief for Navalny's supporters after prosecutors asked that he be imprisoned for 10 years.\n\nThe Kremlin denies allegations that it uses the courts to persecute opponents.\n\nOfficials have taken few steps to investigate Navalny's corruption allegations. He claimed there was mass embezzlement, including in state bank VTB\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko. \"Why are you putting him (my brother Oleg) in prison? To punish me even harder?\"\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which critics also called a sham.\n\n\"The authorities are torturing and destroying relatives of their political opponents. This regime doesn't deserve to exist, it must be destroyed,\" Navalny told reporters outside the court as he was escorted in a car for prisoners.\n\nRussian state television channels were not covering the sentencing or mentioned it very briefly, while most Russian print media or radio stations had it among their top stories.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment and said the president would find out about the verdict from media. Russian media quoted a source in the prosecutors' office as saying it may appeal Tuesday's ruling to seek a tougher sentence for Alexei Navalny.\n\nPutin's popularity has soared over the past year after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea peninsula and its incursion in east Ukraine, which led to the worst stand-off with the West since the end of the Cold War. This has eroded the popularity of opposition leaders such as Navalny.\n\nHowever, falling oil prices and Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine have triggered a deep economic crisis, a rouble devaluation and double-digit inflation, threatening Putin's reputation for safeguarding Russian prosperity.\n\nFormer Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, one of the most respected Russian economists in the West, said this month Russia was facing a full-fledged crisis which could lead to mass protests next year.\n\n\"The authorities could have easily put Navalny in jail. But they understand that it would have led to a large wave of protests. So they will torture him through other means,\" economist and former central banker turned opposition figure, Sergei Aleksashenko, told independent television channel Dozhd.\n\n\"The charges against them (brothers) have not been substantiated during the trial,\" said European Union spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic.\n\nGermany's commissioner for human rights, Christoph Straesser, also criticized the decision.\n\n?The court?s decision is a further blow to critical civil society in Russia,\" he said.\n\n\"Alexei Navalny is trying to exercise his right (to freedom of opinion) in a peaceful way. He must continue to be allowed to participate in political life.\"\n\nLawyers for Oleg Navalny said they didn't know where exactly he would be sent to serve his prison term. Billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Putin critic, served his 10-year jail term in penal colonies from northern Russia to east Siberia.\n\n(Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Dominic Evans and Anna Willard)",

The date of his sentence had been moved up by two weeks, prompting demonstrations in his support.\n\nA Moscow court sentenced Alexi Navalny to a 3.5 year suspended jail term on Monday for embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from two firms, including an affiliate of French comestics company Yves Rocher. His brother Oleg was given three and a half years in prison.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko.\n\nProsecutors in Moscow had asked the court earlier to move up the date on dissenter Alexei Navalny's case and to sentence him to 10 years in prison, an unusually high sentence for a financial crime. Navalny's sentence hearing was originally scheduled for January 15, prompting thousands of his supporters to stage a protest. The former lawyer and rights activist has been under house arrest since February this year.\n\nFollowing the court's decision to reschedule the hearing, Navalny's supporters decided to protest on Tuesday. \"We have no choice, we need to come out tomorrow and show how numerous we are,\" protest organizers said on Facebook the previous day.\n\nThe lawyer and popular blogger rose to prominence due to his investigations of official corruption and his leading role in organizing massive anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, in a different criminal case, Navalny was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013 with 27 percent of the vote.\n\nNavalny was also found guilty of slandering a city lawmaker in spring of 2014.\n\nEarlier in December, prosecutors asked the court to convict Alexei Navalny of defrauding two companies and to sentence him to a decade in prison. Prosecutors are also demanding an eight-year prison sentence for his brother Oleg who is also on trial for the same charge of stealing 30m roubles ($526,000) from two firms.\n\nNavalny, who is under house arrest, has called the charges against him ludicrous. The open critic of Vladimir Putin has previously said that the Russian president himself will personally decide his fate.",

Navalny, a lawyer and activist, led mass anti-Putin protests in 2011 and 2012 and made a strong showing against the Kremlin's hand-picked candidate in the 2013 Moscow mayoral race.\n\nNavalny's supporters vowed to press on with plans to hold a protest rally near the Kremlin Tuesday night. Thousands have pledged on Facebook to attend, but it was unclear whether the lighter-than-expected verdict against Navalny will reduce turnout.\n\nNavalny's verdict was expected in mid-January, but it was abruptly rescheduled to before New Year's Eve -- the biggest holiday of the year in Russia, and the start of an extended national holiday period during which many people leave Moscow.\n\nIn a sign of worry over Navalny's star power, Russian authorities had tried to undercut the planned Navalny rally by asking Facebook to delete the event page.\n\nIn 2013, when a court found Navalny guilty of embezzlement in a different case involving a timber company, authorities released him from prison after just one day following large protests in Moscow. He placed second in the Moscow mayor's race just a few months later.\n\nIn the current case, Navalny and his brother were accused of defrauding a cosmetics company out of $800,000 through fake shipping bills. Prosecutors has sought a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, and Navalny has been under house arrest since February\n\nIn the last year, anti-government protesters have confronted increasing pressures in Russia, which deepened its involvement in Ukraine's conflict and faced growing tensions with the West. But to some Kremlin critics, the falling price of oil and the plunge of Russian ruble raised the possibility that Putin's grip on power might be weakening.\n\nYet Tuesday's verdict demonstrated the unpredictable nature of how justice can be meted against political opposition figures in Russia.\n\nAround this time last year, Putin pardoned and released former oil tycoon and outspoken Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky after a decade-long imprisonment. After his release, Khodorkovsky said he considered Putin \"a political opponent, not an enemy\" because \"he didn't touch my family.\"",

Opposition figures say jailing Navalny risked a new wave of protests and so it was decided to punish him by jailing his brother instead.\n\nNavalny's supporters will gather in front of the Kremlin later on Tuesday with some 17,000 people having registered on Facebook to attend, although the numbers may be smaller as people prepare to celebrate the New Year. The authorities have not given permission for the rally so it is considered illegal and there maybe arrests.\n\nThe Navalny brothers, Alexei and Oleg, were accused of stealing 30 million rubles, or about $500,000 at the current exchange rate, from two firms including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012.\n\nTuesday's ruling will come as a relief for Navalny's supporters after prosecutors asked that he be imprisoned for 10 years. The Kremlin denies allegations that it uses the courts to persecute opponents.\n\nOfficials have taken few steps to investigate Navalny's corruption allegations. He claimed there was mass embezzlement, including in state bank VTB and pipeline monopoly Transneft, run by close allies of Putin.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko. \"Why are you putting him [my brother Oleg] in prison? To punish me even harder?\"\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which critics also called a sham.\n\n\"The authorities are torturing and destroying relatives of their political opponents. This regime doesn't deserve to exist, it must be destroyed,\" Navalny told reporters outside the court as he was escorted in a car for prisoners.\n\nRussian state television channels did not cover the sentencing or mentioned it very briefly, while most Russian print media and radio stations had it among their top stories.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment and said the president would find out about the verdict from the media.\n\nPutin's popularity has soared over the past year after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea peninsula and its incursion in east Ukraine, which led to the worst stand-off with the West since the end of the Cold War. This has eroded the popularity of opposition leaders such as Navalny.\n\nHowever, falling oil prices and Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine have triggered a deep economic crisis, a ruble devaluation and double-digit inflation, threatening Putin's reputation for safeguarding Russian prosperity.\n\nFormer Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, one of the most respected Russian economists in the West, said this month Russia was facing a full-fledged crisis which could lead to mass protests next year.\n\n\"The authorities could have easily put Navalny in jail. But they understand that it would have led to a large wave of protests. So they will torture him through other means,\" economist and former Central Bank official turned opposition figure, Sergei Aleksashenko, told independent television channel Dozhd.\n\nLawyers for Oleg Navalny said they didn't know where exactly he would be sent to serve his prison term. Putin critic and billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky served his 10-year jail term in penal colonies from northern Russia to east Siberia.",

                    "body": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court gave Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny a suspended sentence on Tuesday for embezzling money but jailed his brother for three and a half years in a case seen as part of a campaign to stifle dissent.\n\nNavalny led mass protests against President Vladimir Putin three years ago, when tens of thousands took to the streets in Moscow and St Petersburg to protest against corruption in his government and inner circle.\n\nOpposition figures say jailing Navalny risked a new wave of protests so he was being punished through his brother instead. A German official said the ruling was another blow to civil society in Russia.\n\nNavalny's supporters will gather in front of the Kremlin later on Tuesday with some 18,000 people having registered on Facebook to attend although the numbers may be smaller as people prepare to celebrate the New Year.\n\nThe authorities have not given permission for the rally so it is considered illegal and there may be arrests. Police fenced off the area and a nearby metro station was partially closed.\n\nThe Navalny brothers, Alexei and Oleg, were accused of stealing 30 million roubles, around $500,000 (321,406 pounds) at the current exchange rate, from two firms including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012.\n\nTuesday's ruling will come as a relief for Navalny's supporters after prosecutors asked that he be imprisoned for 10 years.\n\nThe Kremlin denies allegations that it uses the courts to persecute opponents.\n\nOfficials have taken few steps to investigate Navalny's corruption allegations. He claimed there was mass embezzlement, including in state bank VTB\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko. \"Why are you putting him (my brother Oleg) in prison? To punish me even harder?\"\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which critics also called a sham.\n\n\"The authorities are torturing and destroying relatives of their political opponents. This regime doesn't deserve to exist, it must be destroyed,\" Navalny told reporters outside the court as he was escorted in a car for prisoners.\n\nRussian state television channels were not covering the sentencing or mentioned it very briefly, while most Russian print media or radio stations had it among their top stories.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment and said the president would find out about the verdict from media. Russian media quoted a source in the prosecutors' office as saying it may appeal Tuesday's ruling to seek a tougher sentence for Alexei Navalny.\n\nPutin's popularity has soared over the past year after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea peninsula and its incursion in east Ukraine, which led to the worst stand-off with the West since the end of the Cold War. This has eroded the popularity of opposition leaders such as Navalny.\n\nHowever, falling oil prices and Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine have triggered a deep economic crisis, a rouble devaluation and double-digit inflation, threatening Putin's reputation for safeguarding Russian prosperity.\n\nFormer Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, one of the most respected Russian economists in the West, said this month Russia was facing a full-fledged crisis which could lead to mass protests next year.\n\n\"The authorities could have easily put Navalny in jail. But they understand that it would have led to a large wave of protests. So they will torture him through other means,\" economist and former central banker turned opposition figure, Sergei Aleksashenko, told independent television channel Dozhd.\n\nGermany's commissioner for human rights, Christoph Straesser, criticized the decision.\n\n?The court?s decision is a further blow to critical civil society in Russia. The Russian government must guarantee the independence of the courts and that legal proceedings take place according to the rule of law,\" he said.\n\n\"Alexei Navalny is trying to exercise his right (to freedom of opinion) in a peaceful way. He must continue to be allowed to participate in political life.\"\n\nLawyers for Oleg Navalny said they didn't know where exactly he would be sent to serve his prison term. Billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Putin critic, served his 10-year jail term in penal colonies from northern Russia to east Siberia.\n\n(Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Dominic Evans and Anna Willard)",

The opposition leader also confirmed that he had been detained.\n\nNavalny and his brother were convicted this morning of defrauding Yves Rocher, a French cosmetics company, fined about $9,000 each and ordered to pay about $77,000 in damages.\n\nThe suspended sentence means Navalny could be sent to prison if he is seen to break the law again. He has been under house arrest since February, but soon after today's verdict, he broke his house arrest, posting a picture of himself on Twitter heading to an opposition rally in Moscow.\n\n\"Yes, there is this house arrest. But today I want to be with you. So I'm coming,\" he said in the tweet.\n\nNavalny was a leader of the mass protests by opposition groups in Moscow three years ago. Since then, the government has brought criminal cases against him. NPR's Corey Flintoff tells our Newscast unit: \"Critics say the government is trying to neutralize Navalny as a political figure but also trying to intimidate the opposition.\"\n\nToday's verdict was scheduled for January, but by moving the decision forward to the day before New Year's Eve, the country's biggest holiday, Russian authorities may have been trying to stem any protests. It's unclear if that move will have any effect. Nearly 20,000 people said on Facebook that they will take part in a protest in Moscow tonight. The AP reported that several thousand people had gathered outside the Kremlin in what was described as an unsanctioned protest.",

Following the verdict, Navalny called on his supporters to attend the event. In an emotional address, he said authorities had taken his brother \"hostage.\"\n\nThe court's verdict was initially scheduled to be announced on January 15. However, on Monday the court dealing with the case confirmed that the announcement had been moved to an earlier date \"because the verdict is already ready.\" The rescheduling of the announcement, which was deemed \"illegal\" by Navalny, caused uproar among his supporters.\n\n\"Of all the possible verdicts, this is the meanest,\" he said. \"Those in power are not just attempting to destroy and lock up their political opponents. This time they are deliberately torturing the [opponents'] relatives...\"\n\nAccording to the event's Facebook page, some 17,000 people plan to attend the unsanctioned by Moscow authorities. Security was beefed up at Manezhnaya Square ahead of the rally planned there by Alexey Navalny's supporters.\n\nPHOTOS: Police block Moscow's #Manezhnaya Square ahead of planned rally after #Navalny verdict http://t.co/3hKkjdNLW8 pic.twitter.com/DyPhZDUGDC\n\n-- RT (@RT_com) December 30, 2014\n\nThe sentence the Navalny brothers got is too soft, according to a ruling United Russia party MP. Mikhail Markelov called on the court to review the case and come up with a tougher penalty. He has reminded that Oleg Navalny was a civil servant while working for the state-owned Russia Post.\n\n\"In this country quite a few lower-level officials are serving jail sentences for less grave crimes, like abuse of power,\" he said. \"Navalny was found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering. Any other official in his place would have got eight to 12 years [in prison].\"\n\nThe criminal case was initiated after managers from cosmetics giant Yves Rocher accused Navalny of major embezzlement in December 2012.\n\nThe executives claimed the activist - together with his brother, a senior manager in a subsidiary of the state enterprise Russian Post - tricked them into signing a transportation contract with Oleg Navalny's own company at inflated prices.\n\nThis company allegedly never provided the services, but instead relied on a subcontract executed by other firms. The scheme worked for four-and-a-half years.\n\nThe overall amount of money paid by Yves Rocher to the brothers exceeded 55 million rubles (over US$1.6 million at the time) and the pocketed margin was over 20 million rubles ($600,000), according to the claim.

                    "body": "MOSCOW -- The police in Moscow arrested the anticorruption crusader and political opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny on Tuesday for joining an unauthorized, antigovernment rally, just hours after a Moscow court had given him a suspended sentence on criminal fraud charges.\n\nThe United States State Department issued a warning of possible violence and arrests at the gathering.\n\nEarlier, in a surprise twist, the court had spared Mr. Navalny jail time by suspending his sentence of three and a half years but ordered his younger brother, Oleg, who was also charged, to serve a prison term of the same length.\n\nThe imprisonment of Oleg Navalny, who is generally viewed as a pawn in a larger battle, signaled that the Kremlin was adopting a more sophisticated, if crueler, strategy in seeking to suppress Aleksei Navalny's political activities: sidelining him, but not making a political martyr of him.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed?\" Mr. Navalny cried out in dismay at the judge, Yelena Korobchenko, as she read the verdict.\n\n\"Why are you jailing him?\" Mr. Navalny shouted. \"This is a dirty trick. To punish me more?\"\n\nBailiffs immediately placed Oleg Navalny, a former postal worker who was not politically active and had been virtually unknown in public before the trial, in a cell inside the courtroom. He was wearing a Red Hot Chili Peppers T-shirt.\n\nThe verdict came as critics of the government were hoping that the country's mounting economic problems would begin to loosen President Vladimir V. Putin's grip on power.\n\nAleksei Navalny's house arrest, imposed in February, was expected to end as soon as the suspended sentence, also of three and one-half years, is officially in place. Under Russian law, his felony conviction makes him ineligible to seek public office for 10 years after the sentence is completed. His actions will also be shadowed now by fear of harm befalling his brother in prison.\n\nIn a recent interview published in the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Oleg Navalny, who, like his brother, is married and has two young children, said he understood the risks of his brother's political activism.\n\n\"We absolutely knew that sooner or later this all would touch us,\" he said. \"It is easy to influence a person through his family.\"\n\nThe political opposition in Russia has been largely mute in recent months, as Mr. Putin's popularity has soared following the invasion and annexation of Crimea in the spring. Patriotism has also swelled in response to an aggressive government information campaign, presenting events in Ukraine as a coup orchestrated by the United States and the West in a bid to reduce Russia's sphere of influence.\n\nSome close observers of the Russian political system said that jailing Oleg Navalny effectively turned him into a \"hostage,\" as a way of taking revenge against his brother.\n\n\"Kremlin liberalism,\" Lilia Shevtsova, an expert on Russian domestic politics at the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in a post on Facebook that oozed sarcasm. \"Let's put him on a long leash. We can always shorten it. And the brother gets a real sentence. This means that we take a family member hostage! And we can make his life in prison unbearable.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom, several dozen supporters of Mr. Navalny said they believed that his brother's sentence was meant to punish him.\n\n\"So they have taken him hostage,\" said Vera Kashtanova, a 70-year-old retiree huddled in a heavy fur coat against the morning frost.\n\nMs. Kashtanova said that she had not joined in protests, either during the Soviet era or under Mr. Putin, until this year, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\n\"I am a Sovok,\" she said, using slang that means an old-fashioned Soviet person. \"But I am an enlightened Sovok.\"\n\nAfter the sentence was read, a smattering of anti-Navalny protesters sauntered toward the subway, taunting the opposition leader's supporters.\n\nSome of the them wore orange-and-black St. George's ribbons, a symbol of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany that more recently has signified support of the Kremlin's hard-line policies in Ukraine.\n\n\"A thief should sit in prison!\" one yelled.\n\nOnce again, as with the unexpected pardon last year of another Putin nemesis, the former oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the verdict seemed to underscore the all-encompassing power -- and capriciousness -- of the Russian leader and the system that he appears to command, often by oblique signals.\n\nAfter nearly a year under house arrest, Mr. Navalny, a lawyer who led months of street protests that followed parliamentary elections tainted by accusations of fraud in December 2011, and who then ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Moscow in 2013, has said that he no longer has hope that Russia's future can be determined at the ballot box.\n\n\"What are we going to go out on the streets for?\" he asked in a recent interview with The New York Times. \"There are no elections at all anymore. Talking about falsifications is absurd because none of us are allowed to run.\"\n\nIn another interview, with The Guardian, he said, \"In Russia, it will not be elections that provide a change of government.\"\n\nFar from cowering, Mr. Navalny has publicly and repeatedly accused Mr. Putin and his closest associates in and out of the government of theft and corruption on a vast scale. He accused them more recently of fomenting war in Ukraine for the sake of securing and expanding power.\n\nHe has also made no secret of his own presidential ambitions. And though he has lived for years on the brink of lengthy imprisonment, he has shown no willingness to leave Russia as other prominent critics of Mr. Putin have done in recent years.\n\nGennadi V. Gudkov, a former member of Parliament, compared the sentencing of the opposition leader's brother to the policy of detaining relatives used in Chechnya by the Russian security services and a regional leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, against Islamic militants.\n\n\"It's been made clear in today's case against Navalny,\" Mr. Gudkov wrote on Twitter, \"Putin supports Kadyrov's idea of punishing relatives.\"\n\nMr. Navalny's Twitter account, which has at times been managed by his wife or supporters after a court order prohibited him from using the Internet, featured a message after the ruling saying, \"Of all possible sentences, today's is the most vile.\"\n\nThe fraud case against Mr. Navalny that was decided on Tuesday is just one of numerous criminal prosecutions that have been brought against him in recent years. All of them are generally regarded as a response by the authorities to his political activism.\n\nIn July 2013, Mr. Navalny was convicted of embezzlement after being accused of stealing nearly $500,000 from a state-controlled timber company while working as an unpaid adviser to the governor of the Kirov region east of Moscow. In a dramatic scene, he was sentenced to five years in prison and led from the courtroom in handcuffs, only to be released the next day by a judge who agreed to hear an appeal in the case.\n\nIt was while free from prison in that case that Mr. Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow. He drew a surprisingly strong 27.2 percent of the vote despite facing overwhelming obstacles in standing against the Kremlin-backed incumbent, Sergei S. Sobyanin.\n\nAt the time, it was widely believed that Mr. Sobyanin supported the idea of allowing Mr. Navalny to run as a way of granting some legitimacy to the elections. Although Mr. Sobyanin still had two years left in his term, he had resigned abruptly to force snap elections that gave him a heavy advantage.\n\nIn Kirov, the charges were considered baseless by many legal experts and had been thrown out after a local investigation. The case was resurrected by federal officials in Moscow, and the Kremlin made little effort to mask the political motivation of the prosecution.\n\nThe fraud case was similarly thin.\n\nIt began in December 2012 when the federal Investigative Committee accused Mr. Navalny and his brother, who had worked for the Russian postal service, of defrauding a Russian subsidiary of a French cosmetics company, Yves Rocher, by overcharging for shipping services provided by a private company the brothers had created.\n\nThe subsidiary, Yves Rocher Vostok, which had never reported any problem during its years of working with the Navalny brothers' company, even withdrew a legal complaint that apparently had been submitted at the authorities' behest.\n\nIn some respects, the case seemed almost laughable.\n\nMr. Navalny's brother, realizing that the cosmetics company had unmet shipping needs from a distribution center in Yaroslavl, reached a deal with a Moscow-area sausage manufacturer to fill its empty trucks with perfume and cosmetics for the return trip to the capital.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said the Navalny brothers had overcharged the perfume company by about $800,000 -- an allegation that some critics of the prosecution said would hardly be a crime even if it were true.\n\nWhen the charges were first announced, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter, one of his favorite platforms, and wrote, \"Hey you in the Investigative Committee! Have you gone crazy?\"\n\nIn another Twitter post, he wrote, \"I did not steal your packages, you goats!\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Navalny is known for his sharp tongue and for his deft turns of phrase, no one was amused in the courtroom this month when prosecutors said they would seek a nine-year prison sentence and an additional year as penalty for previous crimes.\n\nIn a closing statement during that hearing, Mr. Navalny railed against the judges, prosecutors and other servants of the Putin government, accusing them of knowingly pursuing baseless prosecutions. He expressed particular outrage over the treatment of co-defendants in his cases, including a friend in Kirov, Pyotr Ofitserov, and his brother.\n\n\"How many times in his life can a person who has done nothing illegal pronounce his closing words?\" Mr. Navalny asked. \"In the last year and a half, this is my sixth or 10th closing statement. It's as if the end of days are coming.\"\n\nMr. Navalny has said that he does not believe opinion polls showing an increase in support for Mr. Putin since the annexation of Crimea. In fact, he has said, even supporters of Mr. Putin are prepared to betray him at the first sign of weakness.\n\n\"These people are waiting,\" Mr. Navalny said. \"The oligarchs, Putin's ministers and all the others are waiting. They will betray Putin the second they feel like he has weakened. But for now he hasn't. For now Putin has total authority over Russia.\"",

The opposition leader has been under house arrest since February and will remain there until the appeals process is exhausted, his lawyer told The Associated Press.\n\nBut soon after today's verdict, Navalny apparently broke his house arrest, posting a picture of himself on Twitter heading to an opposition rally in Moscow.\n\n\"Yes, there is this house arrest. But today I want to be with you. So I'm coming,\" he said in the tweet.\n\nNavalny was a leader of the mass protests by opposition groups in Moscow three years ago. Since then, the government has brought criminal cases against him.

Opposition figures say jailing Navalny risked a new wave of protests, and so it was decided to punish him by jailing his brother instead.\n\nNavalny's supporters will gather in front of the Kremlin later on Tuesday with some 17,000 people having registered on Facebook to attend although the numbers may be smaller as people prepare to celebrate the New Year. The authorities have not given permission for the rally, so it is considered illegal and there maybe arrests.\n\nThe Navalny brothers, Alexei and Oleg, were accused of stealing 30 million rubles, around $500,000 (U.S.) at the current exchange rate, from two firms, including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 2008 and 2012.\n\nTuesday's ruling will come as a relief for Navalny's supporters after prosecutors asked that he be imprisoned for 10 years. The Kremlin denies allegations that it uses the courts to persecute opponents.\n\nOfficials have taken few steps to investigate Navalny's corruption allegations. He claimed there was mass embezzlement, including in state bank VTB and pipeline monopoly Transneft, run by close allies of Putin.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko. \"Why are you putting him [my brother Oleg] in prison? To punish me even harder?\"\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which critics also called a sham.\n\n\"The authorities are torturing and destroying relatives of their political opponents. This regime doesn't deserve to exist, it must be destroyed,\" Navalny told reporters outside the court as he was escorted in a car for prisoners.\n\nRussian state television channels were not covering the sentencing or mentioned it very briefly, while most Russian print media or radio stations had it among their top stories.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment and said the president would find out about the verdict from media.\n\nPutin's popularity has soared over the past year after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Russian-speaking Crimea peninsula and its incursion in east Ukraine, which led to the worst stand-off with the West since the end of the Cold War. This has eroded the popularity of opposition leaders such as Navalny.\n\nHowever, falling oil prices and Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine have triggered a deep economic crisis, a rouble devaluation and double-digit inflation, threatening Putin's reputation for safeguarding Russian prosperity.\n\nFormer Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, one of the most respected Russian economists in the West, said this month Russia was facing a full-fledged crisis which could lead to mass protests next year.\n\n\"The authorities could have easily put Navalny in jail. But they understand that it would have led to a large wave of protests. So they will torture him through other means,\" economist and former central banker turned opposition figure, Sergei Aleksashenko, told independent television channel Dozhd.\n\nLawyers for Oleg Navalny said they didn't know where exactly he would be sent to serve his prison term. Putin's critic and billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky served his 10-year jail term in penal colonies from northern Russia to east Siberia.",

Temperatures were below freezing on Tuesday.\n\nOutside the courtroom, several dozen supporters of Mr. Navalny's said they believed that Oleg Navalny's sentence was meant to punish his brother. Most said they had expected jail time for both of them. None said they believed that one brother would be imprisoned and the other released.\n\n\"So they have taken him hostage,\" said Vera Kashtanova, a 70-year-old pensioner huddled in a heavy fur coat against the morning frost.\n\nMs. Kashtanova said that she had not joined in protests, either during the Soviet era or under Mr. Putin, until this year, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\n\"I am a Sovok,\" she said, using slang that means an old-fashioned, Soviet person. \"But I am an enlightened Sovok.\"\n\nAfter the sentence was read, a smattering of anti-Navalny protesters sauntered toward the subway, taunting the opposition leader's supporters.\n\nThey wore orange-and-black St. George's Ribbons, a symbol of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany that more recently has signified support of the Kremlin's hard-line policies in Ukraine.\n\n\"A thief should sit in prison!\" one yelled.\n\nOnce again, as with the unexpected pardon last year of another Putin nemesis, the former Yukos oil company tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the verdict seemed to underscore the all-encompassing power -- and capriciousness -- of the Russian leader and the system that he appears to command by oblique signals.\n\nAfter nearly a year under house arrest, Mr. Navalny, a lawyer who led months of street protests that followed parliamentary elections tainted by accusations of fraud in December 2011 and then ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Moscow in 2013, has said that he no longer has hope that Russia's future can be determined at the ballot box.\n\n\"What are we going to go out on the streets for?\" he asked in a recent interview with The New York Times. \"There are no elections at all anymore. Talking about falsifications is absurd because none of us are allowed to run.\"\n\nIn another interview, with The Guardian, he said, \"In Russia, it will not be elections that provide a change of government.\"\n\nFar from cowering, Mr. Navalny has publicly and repeatedly accused Mr. Putin and his closest associates in and out of the government of theft and corruption on a vast scale. He accused them more recently of fomenting war and death in Ukraine for the sake of securing and expanding power.\n\nHe has also made no secret of his own presidential ambitions. And though he has lived for years on the brink of lengthy imprisonment, has shown no willingness to leave Russia as other prominent critics of Mr. Putin have done in recent years.\n\nGennadi V. Gudkov, a former member of Parliament, compared the sentencing of the opposition leader's brother to the policy of detaining relatives used by the Russian security services and a regional leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, in Chechnya against Islamic terrorists.\n\n\"It's been made clear in today's case against Navalny,\" he wrote on Twitter, \"Putin supports the idea of Kadyrov of punishing relatives.\"\n\nMr. Navalny's Twitter account, which has at times been managed by his wife or supporters after a court order prohibiting Mr. Navalny from using the Internet, posted after the ruling that \"of all possible sentences, today's is the most vile.\"\n\nThe fraud case against Mr. Navalny that was decided on Tuesday is just one of numerous criminal prosecutions that have been brought against him in recent years. All of them are generally regarded as a response by the authorities to his political activism.\n\nIn July 2013, Mr. Navalny was convicted of embezzlement after being accused of stealing nearly $500,000 from a state-controlled timber company while working as an unpaid adviser to the governor of the Kirov region. In a dramatic scene, he was sentenced to five years in prison and led from the courtroom in handcuffs, only to be released the next day by a judge who agreed to hear an appeal in the case.\n\nIt was while free from prison in that case that Mr. Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow. He drew a surprisingly strong 27.2 percent of the vote despite facing overwhelming obstacles against the Kremlin-backed incumbent, Sergei S. Sobyanin.\n\nAt the time, it was widely believed that Mr. Sobyanin supported the idea of allowing Mr. Navalny to run as a way of granting some legitimacy to the elections. Although Mr. Sobyanin still had two years left in his term, he had resigned abruptly to force snap elections that gave him a heavy advantage.\n\nIn Kirov, the charges were considered baseless by many legal experts and had been thrown out after a local investigation. The case was resurrected by federal officials in Moscow, and the Kremlin made little effort to mask the political motivation of the prosecution.\n\nThe fraud case was similarly thin. It began in December 2012 when the federal Investigative Committee accused Mr. Navalny and his brother, who had worked for the Russian postal service, of defrauding a Russian subsidiary of a French perfume company, Yves Rocher, by overcharging for shipping services.\n\nThe company, which had never reported any problem during its years of working with a company set up by the Navalny brothers, even withdrew a legal complaint that apparently had been submitted at the behest of the authorities.\n\nIn some respects, the case seemed almost laughable. Mr. Navalny's brother, realizing that the perfume company had unmet shipping needs from a distribution center in Yaroslavl, reached a deal with a Moscow-area sausage company to fill its empty trucks with perfume and cosmetics for the return trip to the capital.\n\nThe Investigative Committee said the Navalny brothers had overcharged the perfume company by about $800,000. When the charges were first announced, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter, one of his favorite platforms, and wrote, \"Hey you in the Investigative Committee! Have you gone crazy?\"\n\nIn another Twitter post, he wrote, \"I did not steal your packages, you goats!\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Navalny is known for his sharp tongue and for his deft turns of phrase, no one was laughing in the courtroom this month when prosecutors said they would seek a nine-year prison sentence and an additional year as penalty for previous crimes.\n\nIn a closing statement during that hearing, Mr. Navalny railed against the judges, prosecutors and other servants of the Putin government, accusing them of knowingly pursuing false prosecutions. He expressed particular outrage over the treatment of co-defendants in his cases, including a friend, Pyotr Ofitserov in Kirov, and his brother.\n\n\"How many times in his life can a person who has done nothing illegal pronounce his closing words?\" Mr. Navalny asked. \"In the last year and a half, this is my sixth or tenth closing statement. It's as if the end of days are coming. All of you -- judges, prosecutors, plaintiffs -- look down at the table when talking to me. You all say, 'But Aleksei Anatolyevich, of course you understand everything.'\"\n\n\"I do understand everything,\" Mr. Navalny said. \"Nobody will tell his family: 'Today I have put in prison a person known to be innocent, and I will have to live with it.' I understand that the same phrase will he heard, 'Well, but you understand everything' or 'Why is he so hard on Putin?'\"\n\nOpinion polls have shown Mr. Putin's public support rising sharply after the annexation of Crimea. Mr. Navalny, however, has said that he does not believe the surveys and that, in fact, even supporters of Mr. Putin are prepared to betray him at the first sign of weakness.\n\nA number of opposition figures have long said they hoped that weakness would result from economic problems, as a consequence of Mr. Putin's failure to diversify the economy beyond the main sectors of oil and gas, and a failure to address rampant corruption.\n\nAnd many believe that Mr. Putin's toughest moments in his 15 years as Russia's paramount leader could be just on the horizon.\n\nWith the Russian economy taking a two-fisted beating from lower worldwide oil prices and Western sanctions, the ruble has fallen precipitously in recent months. Economists have predicted soaring inflation and a recession -- a dreadful combination known as stagflation that is difficult for policy makers to remedy.\n\nFood prices have already begun rising sharply, creating the possibility for discontent to spread across the heartland of Russia in a way that did not occur following the disputed elections of 2011. Then, the opposition to Mr. Putin was largely confined to the big cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg and he crushed it.\n\nMr. Navalny has said he believes supporters will turn on Mr. Putin.\n\n\"These people are waiting,\" he said. \"The oligarchs, Putin's ministers and all the others are waiting. They will betray Putin the second they feel like he has weakened. But for now he hasn't. For now Putin has total authority over Russia.\"",

                    "body": "Top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was detained by police on Tuesday after he violated his house arrest to join a protest in Moscow over a guilty verdict against him and his brother in a controversial fraud case.\n\nDozens of other people were also detained as hundreds gathered in central Moscow after the charismatic 38-year-old opposition leader called on Russians to take to the streets against President Vladimir Putin's regime following Tuesday's court ruling.\n\nA Moscow judge found both Navalny and his brother Oleg guilty of embezzlement and sentenced them to three and a half years, but while Navalny's sentence was suspended, his younger brother, who is not involved in politics, was ordered to serve the time behind bars.\n\nThe sentence against his 31-year-old brother infuriated Navalny and was interpreted by his allies as an attempt to muzzle him and thwart his presidential ambitions ahead of a 2018 election.\n\nNavalny, who was put under house arrest earlier this year, managed to escape and took a selfie on the Moscow metro as he sought to join the crowd bound for Manezhnaya square.\n\nBut a policeman grabbed him and hauled him into a van.\n\n\"That I am detained means nothing,\" he wrote from the van on FireChat. \"They cannot detain everyone,\" he said, asking people to stay put and brave the freezing temperatures of minus 15 degrees Celsius (five degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\"It's not about me or my brother but about the outrageous hideousness that is happening in our country,\" he told Echo of Moscow radio.\n\nRussia's prison service said it was notifying the court about Navalny's house arrest violation -- a move that could see his suspended sentence converted to a term behind bars.\n\nOver 130 other people were detained at the rally, which did not receive the required authorization from city hall, according to OVD-Info, an NGO that monitors arrests.\n\nNavalny described Tuesday's verdict as \"the most mean and disgusting possible\" and said Putin's regime was using a strategy to \"torture and torment the relatives of its political opponents.\"\n\n\"This regime has no right to exist, it must be destroyed,\" he said.\n\nNavalny has become a major thorn in the Kremlin's side over the last few years.\n\nHe first built a massive support base on the Internet as an anti-corruption blogger, then rallied tens of thousands during the 2011-12 anti-Putin protests and most recently coming in second in last year's Moscow mayoral race after a grassroots campaign against the Kremlin's candidate.\n\nThe Navalny brothers were accused of defrauding French cosmetics company Yves Rocher of nearly 27 million rubles (more than half a million dollars at the exchange rate at the time), although the firm has said that it suffered no damages.\n\nProsecutors had asked the court to jail Alexei for 10 years and Oleg for eight.\n\nTuesday's hearing was brought forward two weeks in a move seen as a tactic to avoid massive protests and make it impossible to request authorization for rallies.\n\nThe session took only about 15 minutes -- unusual for Russia where judges usually read sentences for hours.\n\n\"What are you jailing him for, what sort of disgrace is this? This is to punish me even more?\" Navalny yelled, slamming his fists on the table, as the judge announced that Oleg, a father of two young children, would be jailed.\n\nObservers say that because of Navalny's prominence the verdict could not have been issued without Putin's personal approval.\n\nHowever, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Kommersant FM radio that Putin merely followed the case in the media.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini's spokeswoman said the verdict \"appears to be politically motivated\" and stressed the \"importance of judicial decisions to be free from political interference.\"\n\nIn a country dominated by Putin for years, observers see Navalny -- a maverick politician who exposed the exorbitant wealth of the elite -- as the one figure who can pose a threat to the strongman.\n\nA talented orator, he is handsome, with a photogenic wife and two children, an unassuming middle-class lifestyle and he lacks ties to the 1990s political scene that many Russians despise.\n\nNavalny -- who has said he intends to run in the 2018 election -- has seen half a dozen criminal cases lodged against him and his allies, which he says are politically motivated.\n\nTuesday's verdict came with Putin facing a plunging ruble and an economy teetering on the edge of recession against the backdrop of Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine.\n\n\"In essence, Oleg has been taken hostage, and Navalny will get discredited due to innocent people sent to jail because of him,\" opposition politician Boris Nemtsov wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"They hope to control Alexei Navalny's political activity... in the years before the 2018 elections\" while still keeping the possibility of jailing Navalny himself later, his ally Leonid Volkov wrote.\n\nThe decision is also aimed at \"intimidating other critics of the government,\" said Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"The Kremlin seems to be telling independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015.\"",

                    "body": "LONDON (AFP) - Top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was detained by police on Tuesday after he violated his house arrest to join a protest in Moscow over a guilty verdict against him and his brother in a controversial fraud case.\n\nTwo dozen other people were also detained as hundreds gathered in central Moscow after the charismatic 38-year-old opposition leader called on Russians to take to the streets against President Vladimir Putin's regime following Tuesday's court ruling.\n\nA Moscow judge found both Navalny and his brother Oleg guilty of embezzlement and sentenced them to three and a half years, but while Navalny's sentence was suspended, his younger brother, who is not involved in politics, was ordered to serve the time behind bars.\n\nThe sentence against his 31-year-old brother infuriated Navalny and was interpreted by his allies as an attempt to muzzle him and thwart his presidential ambitions ahead of a 2018 election.\n\nThe US said it was \"troubled\" by the Russian court's conviction, calling the move a \"disturbing development\".\n\nUS State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke told a briefing: \"It appears to be designed to further punish and deter political activism.\"\n\nNavalny, who was put under house arrest earlier this year, took a selfie on the Moscow metro as he sought to join the crowd bound for Manezhnaya square.\n\nBut a policeman grabbed him and hauled him into a van.\n\n\"That I am detained means nothing,\" he wrote from the van on FireChat.\n\n\"They cannot detain everyone,\" he said, asking people to stay put and brave the freezing temperatures of minus 15 deg C.\n\n\"It's not about me or my brother but about the outrageous hideousness that is happening in our country,\" he told Echo of Moscow radio.\n\nRussia's prison service said it was notifying the court about Navalny's house arrest violation - a move that could see his suspended sentence converted to a term behind bars.\n\nTwo dozen other people were detained at the rally, which did not receive the required authorisation from city hall, according to OVD-Info, an NGO that monitors arrests.\n\nNavalny described Tuesday's verdict as \"the most mean and disgusting possible\" and said Putin's regime was using a strategy to \"torture and torment the relatives of its political opponents.\" \"This regime has no right to exist, it must be destroyed,\" he said.\n\nTHORN IN KREMLIN'S SIDE\n\nNavalny has become a major thorn in the Kremlin's side over the last few years.\n\nHe first built a massive support base on the Internet as an anti-corruption blogger, then rallied tens of thousands during the 2011-2012 anti-Putin protests and most recently coming in second in last year's Moscow mayoral race after a grassroots campaign against the Kremlin's candidate.\n\nThe Navalny brothers were accused of defrauding French cosmetics company Yves Rocher of nearly 27 million roubles (more than half a million dollars at the exchange rate at the time), although the firm has said that it suffered no damages.\n\nProsecutors had asked the court to jail Alexei for 10 years and Oleg for eight.\n\nTuesday's hearing was brought forward two weeks in a move seen as a tactic to avoid massive protests and make it impossible to request authorisation for rallies.\n\nThe session took only about 15 minutes - unusual for Russia where judges usually read sentences for hours.\n\n\"What are you jailing him for, what sort of disgrace is this? This is to punish me even more?\" Navalny yelled, slamming his fists on the table, as the judge announced that Oleg, a father of two young children, would be jailed.\n\nObservers say that because of Navalny's prominence the verdict could not have been issued without Putin's personal approval.\n\nHowever, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Kommersant FM radio that Putin merely followed the case in the media.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini's spokeswoman said the verdict \"appears to be politically motivated\" and stressed the \"importance of judicial decisions to be free from political interference.\"\n\nBROTHER TAKEN HOSTAGE\n\nIn a country dominated by Putin for years, observers see Navalny - a maverick politician who exposed the exorbitant wealth of the elite - as the one figure who can pose a threat to the strongman.\n\nA talented orator, he is handsome, with a photogenic wife and two children, an unassuming middle-class lifestyle and he lacks ties to the 1990s political scene that many Russians despise.\n\nNavalny - who has said he intends to run in the 2018 election - has seen a half a dozen criminal cases lodged against him and his allies, which he says are politically motivated.\n\nTuesday's verdict came with Putin facing a plunging rouble and an economy teetering on the edge of recession against the backdrop of Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine.\n\n\"In essence, Oleg has been taken hostage, and Navalny will get discredited due to innocent people sent to jail because of him,\" opposition politician Boris Nemtsov wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"They hope to control Alexei Navalny's political activity... in the years before the 2018 elections\" while still keeping the possibility of jailing Navalny himself later, his ally Leonid Volkov wrote.\n\nThe decision is also aimed at \"intimidating other critics of the government,\" said Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"The Kremlin seems to be telling independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015.\"",

                    "body": "The anti-government rally followed a Moscow court's verdict earlier Tuesday in which Navalny brother, but not him, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on criminal fraud charges.\n\nMoscow police briefly detained Russia's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, as he tried to join an unauthorized rally on Tuesday after a court handed him a suspended sentence in a high-profile fraud case.\n\nPolice reportedly said they were merely escorting Mr. Navalny back to his home, \"in a sign of how unwilling the authorities are to make a martyr of\" him, The New York Times reports.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Mr. Navalny denounced the court's decision to jail his brother Oleg to three and a half years in prison on the same charges. Opposition leaders argued that to avoid mass protests, a risk associated with jailing Navalny, the Kremlin decided to punish him by jailing his brother. They said the court's decision was a politically motivated move to stifle dissent.\n\n\"Shame on you!\" Navalny shouted at the judge in a Moscow court, according to The Washington Post. \"Why are you putting him in jail, just to punish me even more?\"\n\nThe court found both brothers guilty of defrauding two firms, including a French cosmetics company, and laundering money. Navalny's three-and-a-half year suspended sentence means he won't go to prison, but it keeps him under house arrest pending an appeal. His brother was jailed following the verdict.\n\n\"The authorities are torturing and destroying relatives of their political opponents. This regime doesn't deserve to exist, it must be destroyed,\" Navalny told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\nNavalny has become known as President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic for his work as an anti-corruption crusader. He leaped onto the public stage three years ago when he led mass demonstrations to protest corruption in the government and Mr. Putin's inner circle.\n\nIn January, he published a report claiming that huge cost overruns at the Winter Olympics in Sochi enriched a small circle of businessmen close to the Mr. Putin, The Christian Science Monitor reported.\n\nTuesday's verdict was the latest in a series of criminal cases against Navalny. As The Wall Street-Journal reports:\n\nLast year, he was convicted in an unrelated fraud case. He was initially sentenced to five years in prison, but was unexpectedly released on his own recognizance within days. He later ran for mayor of Moscow, coming in second to the pro-Kremlin candidate with 27% of the vote. Shortly after that race, the court converted his jail term into a suspended sentence.\n\nThe court had originally scheduled to announce the latest verdict in January. But the sentencing hearing was moved up after thousands of Navalny's supporters had planned a rally for Jan. 15.\n\nAfter the sentencing, Navalny called on his supporters to protest. About 17,000 people have registered on Facebook to attend a rally in front of the Kremlin. Reuters reports that authorities have not given permission for the event and that there maybe arrests as a result.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that anti-Kremlin protesters have confronted increased pressures in Russia over the last year as tensions with the West have grown.\n\nBut to some Kremlin critics, the falling price of oil and the plunge of Russian ruble raised the possibility that Putin's grip on power might be weakening.\n\nYet Tuesday's verdict demonstrated the unpredictable nature of how justice can be meted against political opposition figures in Russia.\n\nIn a sign of Navalny's influence, the BBC's Stephen Ennis reports that \"Kremlin-controlled TV channels have almost completely ignored the verdict in their main news bulletins.\"",

                    "body": "Thousands of anti-government protesters were expected to gather in Moscow after a Russian court gave the Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny a suspended sentence but jailed his brother Oleg for three and a half years.\n\nIn a case which critics say was politically motivated, the judge on Tuesday handed Navalny - Vladimir Putin's most high-profile opponent - a suspended three-and-a-half year sentence. He had faced up to 10 years in jail. But in an unexpected move which stunned Russia's opposition, the court sentenced Oleg Navalny to a term behind bars.\n\nNavalny's supporters said the Kremlin was returning to the sinister Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of those it disliked. Upon hearing the verdict, mumbled quietly by the judge, Yelena Korobchenko, Alexei Navalny rolled his eyes and looked at his brother.\n\nBoth men were found guilty of stealing 30m roubles (about \u00a3334,000 under the current exchange rate) from the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. Asked by Korobchenko if the rulings against them were clear, Alexei replied: \"Nothing is clear. Why are you imprisoning my brother? By this you punish me even harder.\"\n\nThe sentencing had originally been scheduled for 15 January, but was abruptly brought forward to the day before New Year's Eve, the main Russian holiday, in an apparent attempt to prevent large scale anti-Putin demonstrations. On Tuesday, riot police and military vehicles flooded Moscow's Manezh Square in anticipation of a major protest later in the day directly outside the Kremlin.\n\n\"Of all the possible types of sentence, this is the meanest,\" said Alexei Navalny outside court after his brother was taken away. \"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents - we're used to it, we're aware that they're doing it - but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,\" he said, calling for a protest on Tuesday evening.\n\nWriting on his blog, Navalny said his brother's sentence would not stop him from political activity. He lambasted those at the top of Kremlin power as \"thieves, scoundrels and traitors who must be destroyed\". He also said ordinary Russians were guilty of allowing the political elite to plunder the country. \"We let them through our passivity,\" he wrote.\n\nCritics said the move was the latest attempt by the Kremlin to snuff out Navalny's long-running campaign against Putin. Navalny's friend, the opposition leader Ilya Yashin, said: \"By taking his own brother as a political hostage, the sinister Kremlin wants to squash Navalny's spirit, so he shuts up.\"\n\nWithin hours of the court's decision, Moscow's political chatter was focused on one question: would putting your own family members in prison stop you from protesting against Putin? A majority of listeners tuning in to the liberal radio Echo of Moscow - 75 % - said it would not.\n\nThe radio's editor-in-chief, Aleksei Venedictov, described the Kremlin's new strategy against Navalny as \"sophisticated torture\".\n\n\"The verdict is purely political. The Kremlin weakens Alexei by giving him thousands of little wounds. First they keep him for months under house arrest, forbid him to use the internet, then put him on trial, then throw his brother in jail - taking family members hostage is a sensational new strategy,\" Venediktov told the Guardian.\n\nOleg Navalny is the father of two small children and a former executive of the state-owned postal service. Unlike his better known brother, he has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement. His imprisonment in a penal colony seems to echo the Soviet-era practice of arresting the relatives of \"inconvenient\" people.\n\nThe court's decision quickly rippled from the courtroom to the crowd of Navalny's supporters waiting outside in the deep frost. It was a tiny crowd compared with the more than 100,000 people who attended the anti-Putin rallies that Navalny led only two years ago. In 2013 he came second in Moscow's mayoral election, winning 27% of the vote. On Tuesday, however, many seemed more concerned with shopping for New Year parties.",

That is why I am also going,\" said the caption on the photo.\n\nState news agency Interfax reported that Navalny was detained by police and was returned to his home, instead of being taken to jail. He was on house arrest for a conviction in a 2009 case.\n\nEarlier, Navalny was in court, where he got a three-and-a-half year suspended sentence for the fraud conviction, while his brother, Oleg, also convicted of fraud, was given a prison term of the same length.\n\nBoth were hit with steep fines, but only Oleg Navalny was ordered to pay.\n\nWhen the sentence was read, Alexey Navalny shouted out in anger and frustration with the judgment against his brother.\n\nThe brothers denied charges of embezzling 30 million rubles ($540,000) from a Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher between 2008 and 2012.\n\nThere were strong feelings among some in Moscow that the brothers should not have been sentenced as they were.

                    "body": "PanARMENIAN.Net - Russian opposition activist Aleksey Navalny has got a 3.5-year suspended sentence in an embezzlement case, a Moscow district court announced in an early verdict, Russia Today reported.\n\nNavalny was accused of embezzling over $500,000 from cosmetics company Yves Roche. Those charges can merit a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nThe court's verdict was initially scheduled to be revealed on January 15. However, on Monday the court that is dealing with the case confirmed the announcement has been moved to an earlier date \"because the verdict is already ready.\"\n\nThe blogger himself said he was informed of the moved hearing less than a day prior to it. \"Turns out there are no such exceptions that cannot be arranged for good people,\" a statement on Navalny's website reads. The rearrangement of the date was \"impossible according to the law,\" Navalny claimed on Twitter, according to RT.\n\nThe criminal case against Aleksey Navalny and his brother Oleg Navalny was initiated after managers from cosmetics giant Yves Rocher accused Navalny of major embezzlement in December 2012. The executives claimed the activist - together with his brother, a senior manager in a subsidiary of the state enterprise Russian Post - tricked them into signing a transportation contract with Oleg Navalny's own company at inflated prices.\n\nOfficially charged with 30-million-ruble ($518,000) fraud and money laundering, Navalny has been under house arrest since February. He was banned from using the internet and other means of communication, but continued to update his popular anti-corruption blog by proxy of his wife.\n\nEarlier in December, Russian prosecutors asked that Aleksey Navalny be sentenced to 10 years in prison, and also sought to sentence his brother Oleg to eight years behind bars. Navalny has claimed his innocence on all charges, stating that the scheme was an ordinary go-between business.\n\nNavalny has repeatedly stated that the criminal cases against him were instigated by the authorities as \"revenge\" for his anti-corruption activism and forays into political opposition.\n\nBack in 2013, Navalny received a five-year probation sentence for taking part in a graft scheme involving a state-owned timber company in central Russia's Kirov Region.\n\nNavalny's supporters planned a gathering in central Moscow on Jan 15 - the previously announced date of his trial - with invitations to join spread mostly by means of social media.\n\nThe organizers claimed the mass meeting was going to be a \"discussion of the sentence\" rather than an unauthorized protest rally. Still, one of the Facebook pages created for the event was blocked by Facebook for Russian internet users, enforced by the country's mass media and telecom watchdog Roskomnadzor.",

More than 30,000 people had previously signed up on Facebook to rally outside the Kremlin to protest against what they called an unlawful trial.\n\nOleg Navalny, the father of two young children and a former executive of the state-owned postal service, has never played a role in the Russian opposition movement and his imprisonment could echo the Soviet-era practice of punishing the relatives of inconvenient people.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing? You want to punish me even harder?\" Alexei Navalny shouted out as Judge Yelena Korobchenko handed down the sentence for his brother.\n\nAlexei briefly entered the metal cage his brother was put into after the verdict and appeared to be holding back tears.\n\n\"This is the most disgusting and vile of all possible verdicts,\" he said outside the court.\n\n\"The government isn't just trying to jail its political opponents - we're used to it, we're aware that they're doing it - but this time they're destroying and torturing the families of the people who oppose them,\" he said, and called for a protest tonight.\n\nThe suspended sentence means it could be converted into a prison term at any moment if Alexei Navalny offends again, although this will be up to the court to decide.\n\nHe has been under house arrest since February and his lawyer Vadim Kobzev said he will remain there until all appeals are exhausted, which could take months.\n\nThe trial seemed to be full of inconsistencies and loopholes.\n\nThe company involved, Yves Rocher, wrote a complaint to investigators, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. The French executive who wrote the complaint left Russia shortly afterwards and never attended the hearings.\n\nProsecutors said the brothers forced the company \"into disadvantageous contracts\" and defrauded it of 26 million roubles (about \u00a3290,000).\n\nThe brothers arrived at the courtroom with luggage, indicating they expected to be immediately imprisoned.\n\nNavalny, a lawyer and popular blogger, rose to prominence with his investigations of official corruption and played a leading role in organising massive anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn a trial last year in a different criminal case, he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow. He was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in the capital's mayoral election in September last year.\n\nRussian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent 10 years in jail before he was pardoned last year, dismissed the verdict as the Russian leader's revenge for Navalny's activism.\n\nKhodorkovsky said in a statement that he is \"not even surprised that Putin and his entourage are capable of vile tricks, deception, forgery and manipulation - they are not capable of anything else\".\n\nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message \"to independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015\".",

He claimed there was mass embezzlement, including in state bank VTB and pipeline monopoly Transneft, run by close allies of Putin.\n\n\"Aren't you ashamed of what you are doing?\" Navalny told the court and judge Yelena Korobchenko. \"Why are you putting him (my brother Oleg) in prison?

His slogan \"Do not steal, do not lie\" appeals to many as the foundation for a different Russia.\n\nAs the media focus turned to events in Ukraine this year and coverage on Navalny dwindled to a trickle due to arrest conditions, he accused Putin of waging war in eastern Ukraine to divert attention from corruption.\n\n\"Everything is based on lies,\" he said in his final statement to the court earlier this month. \"These lies have become the mechanism used by the state, they have become the essence of the state.\"\n\n- Man with 'many enemies' -\n\nNavalny's modest upbringing, middle-class lifestyle and lack of ties to the political scene of the 1990s, which many Russians have grown to despise, broaden his appeal.\n\nThe political image is reinforced by western-style photoshoots with his two children and wife Yulia, who has been by his side throughout court ordeals and took over his Twitter blog @navalny and its 860,000 followers after he was banned from using the Internet.\n\nHe has failed to rally all of Putin's critics however, as some in the opposition accuse him of populism and xenophobia, pointing to his participation in nationalist marches in the past.\n\nMost Russians who get their information from state television know him mostly as a convict in a previous timber fraud case.\n\nIn a poll conducted by Levada Centre pollster in September, 48 percent said they know who Navalny was but only 14 percent had a positive view of him.\n\nNavalny began crusading against corruption in state companies in 2007, buying their shares to access company reports and grilling management at annual general meetings.\n\nHis Internet-driven projects - Rospil.info and later the Anti-corruption foundation (FBK) - have exposed suspicious state contracts and the luxurious mansions of public officials both in Russia and abroad, by poring over public reports, transactions and real estate databases.\n\n\"Because of his campaign against corruption, Navalny has many influential enemies,\" said Petrov.\n\nPolitically, he is one of few self-sufficient public figures \"whose popularity does not depend on Putin's,\" he added.\n\n\"If Putin disappeared from the political scene... only very few people would be left standing, including Navalny.\"",

This led to surprise today at Navalny's release, and complaints from pro-Putin elements that a 'thief' had been let off.\n\nThe Navalny brothers were accused of stealing 30 million roubles, or around $500,000 under the current exchange rate,from two firms, including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 2008 and 2012.\n\nThe verdict can be seen as taking the wind out of the sails of anti-Putin groups, but the jailing of his brother appeared vindictive.\n\nAn unauthorised protest against Oleg Navalny's jailing was expected later today in Moscow.\n\nThe provocateur group Pussy Riot released a video supporting the protest, featuring women sweeping snow from the square with brooms and then mounting them and flying off as witches.\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which his supporters also called a sham.\n\nIn the 2013 trial he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow.\n\nHe was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013.\n\nNavalny annoys leading bureaucrats because of his acerbic wit and mocking humour expressed in regular online postings.\n\nMore than 16,000 people have said on Facebook that they would attend an unsanctioned protest called for Tuesday evening in Manezh Square adjacent to the Kremlin.\n\nSorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

This led to surprise today at Navalny's release, and complaints from pro-Putin elements that a 'thief' had been let off.\n\nThe Navalny brothers were accused of stealing 30 million roubles, or around $500,000 under the current exchange rate,from two firms, including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 2008 and 2012.\n\nThe verdict can be seen as taking the wind out of the sails of anti-Putin groups, but the jailing of his brother appeared vindictive.\n\nAn unauthorised protest against Oleg Navalny's jailing was expected later today in Moscow.\n\nThe provocateur group Pussy Riot released a video supporting the protest, featuring women sweeping snow from the square with brooms and then mounting them and flying off as witches.\n\nCurrently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which his supporters also called a sham.\n\nIn the 2013 trial he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow.\n\nHe was then handed a suspended sentence and finished a strong second in Moscow's mayoral election in September 2013.\n\nNavalny annoys leading bureaucrats because of his acerbic wit and mocking humour expressed in regular online postings.",

But they had brought bags of possessions with them, in case they were sent from the courtroom to prison.\n\nIt can take a Russian judge hours, even days, to read out a verdict and pronounce sentence. It took Judge Yelena Korobchenko just 15 minutes. She read quietly, quickly and without emotion.\n\nThere was little surprise about the verdict: Russia has a 99% conviction rate. But it was the sentencing that was unexpected.\n\nAlexei Navalny was visibly shocked that his prison sentence for embezzlement was suspended, while his brother Oleg would be going to jail.\n\n\"Why are you jailing him?\" he shouted at Judge Korobchenko. \"It's a disgrace. Is that to punish me more?\"\n\nBefore he was led away, Oleg Navalny wished the judge a happy new year.\n\nSo why was one brother sent to jail and the other spared?\n\nTheir supporters are convinced this has nothing to do with justice and that politics is at play.\n\nAlexei Navalny is a thorn in the side of the Kremlin: a charismatic anti-corruption campaigner who has emerged as the most prominent opposition figure.\n\nWhen he ran in Moscow's mayoral election last year, he pushed the Kremlin's candidate hard, picking up 27% of the vote.\n\nThe authorities are keen to limit his influence and activities. Alexei Navalny has been under house arrest since February.\n\nBut neither, it seems, do they wish to turn him into a martyr by putting him behind bars. Not yet, anyway.\n\nFor months now, Alexei Navalny has been accusing the Russian authorities of trying to put pressure on him through pressure on his family; in other words, by taking his relatives \"hostage\" because of his own political activities.\n\nOn leaving court today, he said the authorities were \"destroying and torturing the relatives of their political opponents\".\n\n\"This regime does not deserve to exist. It must be destroyed,\" he added.\n\nBut, two days before the start of Russia's New Year holidays, will Muscovites heed Alexei Navalny's calls to take to the streets and protest against the jailing of his brother?",

His brother was sent to prison.\n\nThe convictions are widely seen as a political vendetta for Navalny's role as a leading opposition figure.\n\nNavalny, who has been under house arrest since February, broke its terms to attend the rally and was rounded up by police as he approached the site of the protest. Moscow police said he would be driven back home, but that claim couldn't be independently confirmed.\n\nThe protesters, who gathered on the square, chanted: \"We are the power!\" and \"You won't be able to jail us all!\"\n\nPolice urged them to disperse and arrested some of the demonstrators.\n\nAlexei Mayorov, a security official in the Moscow mayor's office, had warned that any attempt to hold a rally would be quickly blocked, and the police immediately took action.\n\nThe provocateur punk group Pussy Riot had released a video supporting today's demonstration, featuring four stylishly dressed women sweeping snow from the square, then mounting their brooms and flying off as witches across the Kremlin wall in a performance symbolizing protest.\n\nTwo of the performers, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, spent nearly two years in prison on charges of hooliganism for mounting an anti-Putin protest in Moscow's main cathedral in 2012, and won global fame.\n\nToday's verdict had been scheduled for next month, but the court session was abruptly moved forward to the day before New Year's Eve, the main holiday in Russia, in what was widely seen as an attempt to head off protests.

                    "body": "MOSCOW -- A Moscow court Tuesday convicted anti-corruption crusader and political opposition leader Alexei Navalny on criminal fraud charges and handed down a 3 1/2-year suspended sentence. The Moscow police braced for a confrontation with thousands of people planning to protest the verdict outside the Kremlin.\n\nThe punishment sparing Navalny jail time suggested that the Russian authorities were moving to sideline him but not turn him into a political martyr. The verdict came as critics of the government were hoping that the country's mounting economic problems would begin to loosen President Vladimir Putin's grip on power.\n\nNavalny's brother, Oleg, who was charged with him, received a 3 1/2-year sentence, but it was not suspended, and he was immediately jailed.\n\n\"You are punishing me worse by taking my brother,\" Alexei Navalny shouted in the courtroom.\n\nHe had tears in his eyes as his brother was placed inside a cell.\n\nThe stiffer sentence for Navalny's brother, who was widely viewed as a pawn in a larger political battle, was a surprise. It signaled that the Kremlin was adopting a more sophisticated, if crueler, strategy in seeking to suppress Navalny's political activities.\n\nNavalny's own house arrest, imposed last February, was expected to end as soon as the suspended sentence was officially in place.\n\nIt was unclear if by not jailing Navalny the government expected him to restrain his activities for fear of harm befalling his brother, or if the effort was intended to portray the prosecution as more driven by facts than politics.\n\nOnce again, as with the unexpected pardon last year of another Putin nemesis, former Yukos oil company tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the verdict seemed to underscore the all-encompassing power -- and capriciousness -- of the Russian leader and the system that he appears to command by oblique signals.\n\nAfter nearly a year under house arrest, Navalny, a lawyer who led months of street protests that followed parliamentary elections tainted by accusations of fraud in December 2011 and then ran unsuccessfully for Moscow mayor in 2013, has said that he no longer has hope that Russia's future can be determined at the ballot box.\n\n\"What are we going to go out on the streets for?\" he asked in a recent interview with The New York Times. \"There are no elections at all anymore. Talking about falsifications is absurd because none of us are allowed to run.\"\n\nIn another interview, with The Guardian, he said, \"In Russia, it will not be elections that provide a change of government.\"\n\nFar from cowering, Navalny has publicly and repeatedly accused Putin and his closest associates in and out of government of theft and graft on a vast scale. He has accused them more recently of fomenting war and death in Ukraine for the sake of securing and expanding power.\n\nHe has also made no secret of his own presidential ambitions. And although he has lived for years on the brink of lengthy imprisonment, he has shown no willingness to leave Russia as other prominent critics of Putin have done in recent years.",

This is to punish me even more?\" Navalny yelled, slamming his fists on the table, as the judge announced that Oleg, a father of two young children, would be jailed.\n\nObservers say that because of Navalny's prominence the verdict could not have been issued without Putin's personal approval.\n\nHowever, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Kommersant FM radio that Putin merely followed the case in the media.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini's spokeswoman said the verdict \"appears to be politically motivated\" and stressed the \"importance of judicial decisions to be free from political interference.\"\n\n- Brother taken 'hostage' -\n\nIn a country dominated by Putin for years, observers see Navalny -- a maverick politician who exposed the exorbitant wealth of the elite -- as the one figure who can pose a threat to the strongman.\n\nA talented orator, he is handsome, with a photogenic wife and two children, an unassuming middle-class lifestyle and he lacks ties to the 1990s political scene that many Russians despise.\n\nNavalny -- who has said he intends to run in the 2018 election -- has seen half a dozen criminal cases lodged against him and his allies, which he says are politically motivated.\n\nTuesday's verdict came with Putin facing a plunging ruble and an economy teetering on the edge of recession against the backdrop of Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine.\n\n\"In essence, Oleg has been taken hostage, and Navalny will get discredited due to innocent people sent to jail because of him,\" opposition politician Boris Nemtsov wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"They hope to control Alexei Navalny's political activity... in the years before the 2018 elections\" while still keeping the possibility of jailing Navalny himself later, his ally Leonid Volkov wrote.\n\nThe decision is also aimed at \"intimidating other critics of the government,\" said Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"The Kremlin seems to be telling independent voices to expect a harsher crackdown in 2015.\"\n\nTell us what you think about this article Like dislike 0 people liked / 0 people disliked it Share this article More on this topic\n\nHollow tree in Guinea was possible site of Ebola's Ground Zero\n\nPublished: 30 Dec 2014 Total views: 0\n\nJapan factory output down, inflation slows in November\n\nPublished: 26 Dec 2014 Total views: 989\n\nSaudi projects huge deficit as oil price drop bites\n\nPublished: 25 Dec 2014 Total views: 873\n\nItaly to temporarily nationalise troubled steel plant\n\nPublished: 24 Dec 2014 Total views: 558\n\nChina has a slim chance of winning Asian Cup: Perrin\n\nPublished: 28 Dec 2014 Total views: 1,093\n\nSanction-hit Russian state bank VTB receives $1.8 bn aid\n\nPublished: 30 Dec 2014 Total views: 163\n\nInjured Aussie captain Clarke upbeat he will play at World Cup\n\nPublished: 24 Dec 2014 Total views: 748\n\nUkraine, pro-Russian rebels resume peace talks\n\nPublished: 25 Dec 2014 Total views: 871\n\n22 Libya soldiers killed in speedboat attack on oil ports\n\nPublished: 26 Dec 2014 Total views: 819\n\nPrayer vigil held in New York for slain police officer\n\nPublished: 27 Dec 2014 Total views: 483\n\nCroatian president, rival head for run-off after tight contest\n\nPublished: 29 Dec 2014 Total views: 481\n\nRegime strikes kill 52 civilians in Syria: monitor\n\nPublished: 26 Dec 2014 Total views: 555\n\nOther stories in this category * Russian police detain Kremlin critic Navalny at ... * Gambia foils coup bid, attackers killed: ... * Hollow tree in Guinea was possible site of ... * Sanction-hit Russian state bank VTB receives ... * US home prices continue to flatten in October * Bratislava 'croissants' offer a taste of the ...

                    "body": "Aleksei Navalny rose to prominence as an anticorruption blogger with a special knack for turning a scathing phrase. The most devastating was his branding of United Russia, which supported Vladimir V. Putin's candidacy for president, as \"the party of swindlers and thieves\" -- which quickly became an unshakable catchphrase. Take a look through quotes by the Russian opposition figure. DEC. 29, 2014\n\nOn Revolution \"Revolution is unavoidable,\" Mr. Navalny said in an interview. \"Simply because the majority of people understand that the system is wrong. When you are in the company of bureaucrats you hear them talking about who has stolen everything, why nothing works and how horrible everything is.\" On Putin's Tech Saviness \"Vladimir Putin and his team do not understand the Internet,\" Mr. Navalny said after a newspaper distributed by a pro-Kremlin group showed Mr. Navalny with a man wanted by the police in Russia. Mr. Navalny said it was a fake, and his assertion was supported when the original, unaltered photograph appeared on Russian Web sites. On Arrest Mr. Navalny continued to post Twitter messages after being arrested. In this case, he posted a photograph of his fellow detainees from inside the police van that took them away. He followed the posting with, \"We're in police van Number 2012. Attention! DO NOT BURN IT. Just puncture the tires.\" On Being Bugged \"Honestly, I thought they'd hide them better,\" was Mr. Navalny's response upon finding a bug in his office. On Putin in the Sky When President Vladimir V. Putin piloted a motorized glider over an Arctic wilderness while leading six endangered Siberian cranes toward their winter habitat, Mr. Navalny offered this comment: \"About Stalin they said, 'In the night a light will burn in the window.' And of Putin they will say, 'He flew over our homes with a flock of cranes.' \" On Being Investigated When the police opened a new criminal investigation against Mr. Navalny, the street protest leader offered via Twitter, \"Hey you in the Investigative Committee! Have you gone crazy?\" He followed up with, \"I did not steal your packages, you goats.\" On the Human Soul When many of Mr. Navalny's large donors distanced themselves from him, he said, \"Man is weak. I am not blaming anyone, but man is weak.\" On Police When Mr. Navalny arrived at a rally in Astrakhan to find a large police presence, he wondered aloud where he was. \"Why so much police?\" he asked. \"Is this a sector of Gaza? Is this the Republic of Chad? Is it Syria or Libya?\" The crowd shouted, \"No!\" Mr. Navalny continued: \"I am afraid that the guys who sit in the power offices in the Kremlin forgot the name of our country. What is the name of our country?\" On Criminal Cases Against Him \"One year ago, when I was here at the rally, there were zero criminal cases against me. At a rally on Sept. 15, there was one criminal case against me. At a rally on Dec. 15, there were four criminal cases against me. Now there are either four or six criminal cases against me. I lost count myself,\" Mr. Navalny said. \"And I don't give a damn! There may be 124 criminal cases and I will go on saying what I want and I will speak my mind. And I think that you do not want to hear anything from me but truth.\" On Persisting The opposition leader delivered an emotional speech in response to a prosecutor's closing arguments demanding that he be convicted on embezzlement charge. \"I cannot run away from myself,\" he said. \"I have nothing else but this.\" On Fraud Case In his final statement in a case in which he is charged with defrauding a Russian subsidiary of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, Mr. Navalny said, \"How many times in his life can a person who has done nothing illegal pronounce his closing words?\" He added, \"I do not for one second regret my actions fighting corruption.\"",

His slogan \"Do not steal, do not lie\" appeals to many as the foundation for a different Russia.\n\nAs the media focus turned to events in Ukraine this year and coverage on Navalny dwindled to a trickle due to arrest conditions, he accused Putin of waging war in eastern Ukraine to divert attention from corruption.\n\n\"Everything is based on lies,\" he said in his final statement to the court earlier this month. \"These lies have become the mechanism used by the state, they have become the essence of the state.\"\n\n- Man with 'many enemies' -\n\nNavalny's modest upbringing, middle-class lifestyle and lack of ties to the political scene of the 1990s, which many Russians have grown to despise, broaden his appeal.\n\nThe political image is reinforced by western-style photoshoots of his family.\n\nNavalny's wife Yulia has been by his side throughout court ordeals and even took over his Twitter blog @navalny and its 860,000 followers after he was banned from using the Internet.\n\nHe has failed to rally all of Putin's critics however, as some in the opposition accuse him of populism and xenophobia, pointing to his participation in nationalist marches in the past.\n\nMost Russians who get their information from state television know him mostly as a convict in a previous timber fraud case.\n\nIn a poll conducted by Levada Centre pollster in September, 48 percent said they know who Navalny was but only 14 percent had a positive view of him.\n\nNavalny began crusading against corruption in state companies in 2007, buying their shares to access company reports and grilling management at annual general meetings.\n\nHis Internet-driven projects - Rospil.info and later the Anti-corruption foundation (FBK) - have exposed suspicious state contracts and the luxurious mansions of public officials both in Russia and abroad, by poring over public reports, transactions and real estate databases.\n\nPolitically, he is one of few self-sufficient public figures \"whose popularity does not depend on Putin's,\" he added.\n\n\"If Putin disappeared from the political scene... only very few people would be left standing, including Navalny.\"",

His brother was sent to prison.\n\nThe convictions are widely seen as a political vendetta for Navalny's role as a leading opposition figure.\n\nNavalny, who has been under house arrest since February, broke its terms to attend the rally and was rounded up by police as he approached the site of the protest. Moscow police said he would be driven back home, but that claim couldn't be independently confirmed.\n\nThe protesters, who gathered on the square, chanted: \"We are the power!\" and \"You won't be able to jail us all!\"\n\nPolice urged them to disperse and arrested some of the demonstrators.\n\nAlexei Mayorov, a security official in the Moscow mayor's office, had warned that any attempt to hold a rally would be quickly blocked, and the police immediately took action.\n\nThe provocateur punk group Pussy Riot had released a video supporting today's demonstration, featuring four stylishly dressed women sweeping snow from the square, then mounting their brooms and flying off as witches across the Kremlin wall in a performance symbolizing protest.\n\nTwo of the performers, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, spent nearly two years in prison on charges of hooliganism for mounting an anti-Putin protest in Moscow's main cathedral in 2012, and won global fame.",

He was sentenced to a suspended sentence of three and a half years, but in a move that critics dubbed cynical and politically engineered, his brother and co-defendant, Oleg, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.\n\nOutside the court, Navalny, subject of The Term, a documentary that premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in July, told waiting journalists: \"The authorities are torturing and destroying relatives of their political opponents. This regime doesn't deserve to exist; it must be destroyed.\"\n\nRead more Russia: Hollywood Maintains Box Office Lead in 2014 Despite Ruble Woes\n\nSentencing in the case had been due Jan. 15 but was brought forward after tens of thousands signed up via Facebook and other social media sites to join protests scheduled for that day. Social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Russia's biggest social media site, Vkontakte, had been resisting Kremlin attempts to take down posts advocating the protests.\n\nPussy Riot's professionally produced film-noir-style 71 second clip asks people to gather Tuesday evening on a public square near Moscow's Red Square.\n\nThe video shows a group of young women dressed in 1920s-style clothes in a darkened, smoky room before taking Harry Potter-style broomsticks to sweep the snow from Red Square and flying over the impenetrable Kremlin walls, like witches, to a pounding bass sound track repeating the words, subtitled in English, \"clean...fair [honest]...word...deed.\"\n\nUnlike earlier videos the women who appear in the film are not masked. The scenes of a group of women brushing away snow near Red Square seems calculated to have been shot not to attract unwelcome attention: the elegantly, stocking and high-heel clad figures could easily be mistaken for the cast of a glossy magazine fashion shoot.\n\nRead more Pussy Riot Members Launch Prisoners-Rights NGO\n\nTwo members of Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, both of whom appear in the video, with Nadezhda's voice clearly heard in the lyrics, were themselves sentenced to prison terms in 2012 in a case they claimed was politically motivated. They were released in December 2013.\n\nThe video, which calls for people to gather at 7 p.m. local time Tuesday near the Kremlin, had clocked up 21,600 views (as well as 460 likes and 163 dislikes) by mid-afternoon Moscow time Monday. A separate Facebook page calling for people to attend the demonstration had, by the same time, recorded more than 18,000 intending to participate. If that many people take to the streets of Moscow tonight, it will represent the biggest challenge to the Kremlin's authority since the mass protests of December 2011.",

Deed.\"\n\n\"Kremlin propaganda and Putin himself has long portrayed everyone who is dissatisfied with the way things are going on the country and wants political change as devils and witches,\" the band said. \"Members of Pussy Riot are taking their image to the heart of Moscow to prepare the square for thousands and thousands of Russians who are ready to take their city back.\"\n\nThe video, which finds the members of Pussy Riot dressed as witches and sweeping the Square with their broomsticks, arrives just days after Russia changed the sentencing date of opposition leaders Alexei and Oleg Navalny. \"The four words heard in the musical piece: Clean, Honest, Word and Deed are implying that Russians are ready to start cleaning up their country, putting an end to mass arrests, fighting for their political rights and putting the real meaning back in the words that matter,\" the group writes.\n\nThe video is the band's first since they caused an uproar and got whipped by police at the Sochi Winter Olympics in \"Putin Will Teach You How to Love the Motherland.\"",

El Tribunal Zamoskvoretski de Mosc\u00fa conden\u00f3 este martes a tres a\u00f1os y medio de prisi\u00f3n al l\u00edder de la oposici\u00f3n extraparlamentaria rusa, Alex\u00e9i Navalni, y a su hermano Oleg, hallados culpables de cometer varios delitos econ\u00f3micos.\n\nEl hombre considerado hasta hace poco como el \"enemigo pol\u00edtico n\u00famero uno\" del presidente ruso, Vlad\u00edmir Putin, no entrar\u00e1 en prisi\u00f3n y cumplir\u00e1 la pena en r\u00e9gimen de libertad condicional, seg\u00fan la sentencia dictada por la jueza que ha instruido la causa, citada por las agencias rusas.\n\nMientras, Oleg Navalni, condenado a otros tres a\u00f1os y medio de c\u00e1rcel, fue detenido en la sala del tribunal y deber\u00e1 cumplir la pena impuesta en prisi\u00f3n. El fallo es \"una cerdada\", reaccion\u00f3 a la condena Alex\u00e9i Navalni, que se mostr\u00f3 indignado por la decisi\u00f3n de encarcelar a su hermano. \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 le mete en prisi\u00f3n? \u00bfAs\u00ed me quiere castigar a m\u00ed?\", se dirigi\u00f3 el opositor a la jueza.\n\nEl opositor, famoso por sus denuncias de corrupci\u00f3n en la administraci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, mantiene su inocencia y vincula el proceso abierto en su contra con sus actividades pol\u00edticas.\n\n\"Recurriremos sin falta la decisi\u00f3n inculpatoria del tribunal\", dijo a la salida de la sala la abogada de los Navalni, Olga Mij\u00e1ilova.\n\nEl fallo condenatorio incluye una multa de 500.000 rublos para cada uno de los hermanos (unos 8.800 d\u00f3lares al cambio de hoy) y les condena adem\u00e1s al pago de 4,4 millones de rublos (77.000 d\u00f3lares) a la empresa de procesamiento de pagos electr\u00f3nicos a la que estafaron, seg\u00fan la Justicia rusa, esa cantidad.\n\nLa jueza ley\u00f3 \u00fanicamente la parte resolutiva del fallo, algo que permite la legislaci\u00f3n rusa para causas econ\u00f3micas complejas. La lectura de la sentencia, que deb\u00eda ser dictada el pr\u00f3ximo 15 de enero, fue adelantada de manera sorpresiva a esta ma\u00f1ana, seg\u00fan muchos opositores, para minimizar las posibles protestas populares.\n\nAunque la red social Facebook accedi\u00f3 a la solicitud de las autoridades de bloquear una cuenta en la que miles de personas se inscribieron para participar en una manifestaci\u00f3n no autorizada, cerca de 9.000 ciudadanos se apuntaron ayer mismo a una nueva convocatoria de protesta.\n\nLa Fiscal\u00eda solicitaba diez a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n contra Alex\u00e9i Navalni, acusado junto a su hermano Oleg del robo de 26,7 millones de rublos (casi 500.000 d\u00f3lares) de la empresa de perfumer\u00eda Yves Rocher Vostok y de otros 4,4 millones de rublos (unos 80.000 d\u00f3lares) de una empresa de procesamiento de pagos electr\u00f3nicos.\n\nSeg\u00fan la acusaci\u00f3n, los hermanos Navalni blanquearon posteriormente 21 millones de rublos (m\u00e1s de 300.000 d\u00f3lares) por medio de compa\u00f1\u00edas ficticias.

Un tribunal de Mosc\u00fa declar\u00f3 al pol\u00edtico y a su hermano Oleg culpables de robar propiedad de dos empresas, una de ellas subsidiraria de la francesa Yves Rocher.\n\nAlex\u00e9i Navalni ha sido condenado a tres a\u00f1os y medio de c\u00e1rcel, a cumplir en libertad. Su hermano, sin embargo, s\u00ed tendr\u00e1 que ir a prisi\u00f3n.\n\nActualmente, Navalni cumple un arresto domiciliario de cinco a\u00f1os por un juicio anterior. Sus seguidores de la oposici\u00f3n extraparlamentaria rusa aseguran que los cargos se han inventado y que se trata de una campa\u00f1a del Kremlin para eliminar a la figura m\u00e1s destacada de la oposici\u00f3n al presidente ruso, Vlad\u00edmir Putin.\n\nLos fiscales hab\u00edan pedido diez a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel para Alex\u00e9i Navalni y ocho para Oleg. La defensa ped\u00eda la absoluci\u00f3n, alegando que la acusaci\u00f3n se hab\u00eda fundamentados sobre violaciones de forma, al no existir ninguna declaraci\u00f3n de da\u00f1os.\n\nLos hermanos Navalni han sido condenados por fraude. Seg\u00fan la acusaci\u00f3n, entre el 2008 y el 2012 robaron a la empresa Yves Rocher Vostok m\u00e1s de 26,7 millones de rublos, y a la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Procesamiento Multidisciplinar m\u00e1s de 4,4 millones de rublos. Posteriormente, habr\u00edan legalizado estos fondos gracias a una firma de su propiedad.\n\nAlex\u00e9i Navalni, que se dio a conocer como bloguero al denunciar en la red la corrupci\u00f3n en las altas esferas del poder y los negocios, salt\u00f3 a la escena pol\u00edtica en diciembre del 2011, cuando miles de ciudadanos salieron a la calle para protestar por los resultados de las elecciones legislativas, que consideraban fraudulentos.\n\nLas manifestaciones crecieron en los meses siguientes y se convirtieron en las m\u00e1s numerosas desde que Putin lleg\u00f3 al poder en el a\u00f1o 2000. Adem\u00e1s del carisma, a favor de Navalni, de 38 a\u00f1os, jug\u00f3 el hecho de que no ten\u00eda relaci\u00f3n con los pol\u00edticos de la dif\u00edcil d\u00e9cada de 1990.\n\nEn septiembre del 2013 Navalni concurri\u00f3 a las elecciones a la alcald\u00eda de Mosc\u00fa. Sorprendi\u00f3 con una campa\u00f1a electoral a pie de calle, sin el apoyo de los canales de televisi\u00f3n, y aunque no pudo superar a la m\u00e1quina oficial logr\u00f3 un sorprendente 27 % de los votos, confirm\u00e1ndose como una figura a tener muy en cuenta por el actual poder.\n\nSus problemas con la justicia comenzaron en v\u00edsperas de esas elecciones, ya que fue condenado a cinco a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel por malversaci\u00f3n de fondos p\u00fablicos.\n\nSus seguidores aseguran que ambos casos son una campa\u00f1a para quitarlo de en medio. En su alegaci\u00f3n antes de o\u00edr la sentencia, Navalni asegur\u00f3 que este juicio tiene motivaciones pol\u00edticas. Pero el Kremlin ha rechazado las acusaciones de que la justicia rusa persigue a los opositores. Ni la presidencia ni el gobierno rusos han hecho valoraciones del juicio. El portavoz del Kremlin, Dimitri Peskov, se ha limitado a decir en la emisora KommersantFM: \"No podemos hacer comentarios al respecto\".\n\nLa sentencia del juicio actual estaba prevista para el pr\u00f3ximo 15 de enero. Cuando se supo, la oposici\u00f3n comenz\u00f3 a organizarse para manifestarse. Hace dos semanas, las autoridades pidieron a Facebook que bloquease la p\u00e1gina de eventos donde estaba colgada la convocatoria, alegando que la protesta no hab\u00eda sido autorizada y era ilegal. Cuando la primera p\u00e1gina desapareci\u00f3, apareci\u00f3 inmediatamente otra. Unas 33.000 personas se registraron en internet para acudir el d\u00eda 15 ala protesta en la plaza del Manezh, junto al Kremlin.\n\nEste lunes, los jueces anunciaron el adelanto de la sentencia para el martes, en lo que parece un intento de minimizar el impacto social, como ha denunciado al abogada de Alex\u00e9i Navalni, Olga Mij\u00e1ilova. En un d\u00eda los seguidores de Navalni se han reorganizado, y unas 10.000 personas dieron su apoyo a una manifestaci\u00f3n en su defensa. Pero la sentencia se ha conocido en una fechas nada propicias, en v\u00edsperas del A\u00f1o Nuevo, y cuando los rusos se preparan para disfrutar de diez d\u00edas de vacaciones oficiales, las m\u00e1s largas del a\u00f1o.\n\nAhora Navalni tendr\u00e1 que seguir bajo arresto domiciliario hasta que la sentencia entre en vigor. Oleg Navalni, por su parte, ha sido puesto bajo custodia en la misma sala del tribunal. Tras la lectura de la sentencia, el abogado y pol\u00edtico ha gritado a los jueces: \"\u00a1\u00bfNo les da verg\u00fcenza?! \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 lo encarcelan a \u00e9l? \u00bfPara castigarme a m\u00ed m\u00e1s?\". Poco despu\u00e9s en su microblog de Twitter, en el que escriben sus compa\u00f1eros, se hizo valoraci\u00f3n de la sentencia: \"De todas las formas posibles de condena, hoy se ha dictado la m\u00e1s cruel\".",

Seg\u00fan la acusaci\u00f3n, los hermanos Navalni blanquearon posteriormente 21 millones de rublos (m\u00e1s de 300.000 d\u00f3lares) por medio de compa\u00f1\u00edas ficticias.\n\nNavalni est\u00e1 en arresto domiciliario desde febrero pasado, tiempo durante el que se le ha prohibido abandonar su casa, comunicarse con otras personas salvo sus familiares, enviar y recibir correo y utilizar el tel\u00e9fono o internet. El opositor ya fue condenado a cinco a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n por el robo en 2009 de 10.000 metros c\u00fabicos de madera por valor de algo m\u00e1s de medio mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, aunque despu\u00e9s fue absuelto.",

Navalni no ir\u00e1 a la c\u00e1rcel, pero deber\u00e1 continuar bajo arresto domiciliario, una f\u00f3rmula \"suave\" de neutralizarle pol\u00edticamente. Precisamente por violar el r\u00e9gimen de arresto domiciliario acaba de ser detenido al intentar unirse a sus partidarios.\n\nEl bloguero anticorrupci\u00f3n, que salt\u00f3 a las primeras p\u00e1ginas de los peri\u00f3dicos en diciembre de 2011, movilizando a decenas de miles de manifestantes contra Putin en las mayores concentraciones habidas tras la ca\u00edda de la Uni\u00f3n Sovi\u00e9tica, ha dicho este martes al abandonar la sala del Tribunal que es necesario \"destruir el r\u00e9gimen\" instaurado por el actual inquilino del Kremlin.\n\nNavalni, considerado el principal rival de Putin, llam\u00f3 a sus partidarios a participar esta tarde en una gran manifestaci\u00f3n en la Plaza Man\u00e9zhnaya, en pleno coraz\u00f3n de Mosc\u00fa. Fue detenido hace unos minutos en las inmediaciones de la Man\u00e9zhnaya cuando trataba de participar en la manifestaci\u00f3n en su apoyo. La Polic\u00eda ha desplegado un descomunal dispositivo de seguridad para impedir la protesta.\n\nEl dirigente opositor y su hermano han sido reconocidos culpables de apropiaci\u00f3n indebida de m\u00e1s de 31 millones de rublos (unos 443.000 euros al cambio actual) pertenecientes a la empresa de cosm\u00e9tica Yves Rocher y a un operador de pagos electr\u00f3nicos. Tambi\u00e9n de haber blanqueado 21 millones de rublos (300.000 euros). El fiscal hab\u00eda pedido una pena de 10 a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel.\n\nPero los hermanos Navalni negaron siempre estas acusaciones. \"Es la sentencia m\u00e1s repugnante y vil de todas las posibles. Las autoridades no s\u00f3lo destruyen a sus oponentes pol\u00edticos, sino tambi\u00e9n aniquila y tortura a sus familiares\", declar\u00f3 Navalni tras escuchar el veredicto del Tribunal. Las organizaciones de Derechos Humanos rusas advierten que el poder ha tomado como \"reh\u00e9n\" al hermano del l\u00edder opositor y subrayan el car\u00e1cter \"pol\u00edtico\" del proceso.\n\nLa sentencia deber\u00eda haberse le\u00eddo el 15 de enero, pero fue sorpresivamente adelantada a hoy. La oposici\u00f3n cree que el Kremlin tem\u00eda que, tras las vacaciones navide\u00f1as, la cantidad de manifestantes podr\u00eda ser muy superior a la que se puede reunir ahora, cuando todos piensan en las fiestas y en los regalos.\n\nNavalni lleva en arresto domiciliario desde febrero y pr\u00e1cticamente incomunicado al tener prohibido el uso del tel\u00e9fono e Internet. En julio del a\u00f1o pasado fue condenado a cinco a\u00f1os de prisi\u00f3n condicional por presunto robo de madera. En las elecciones a alcalde de Mosc\u00fa de septiembre de 2013, el dirigente opositor obtuvo el segundo puesto con m\u00e1s del 27% de los votos.",

Debe ser destruido. Llamo a todo el mundo a tomar las calles\", algo que no ocurre de manera masiva desde 2012, dijo el opositor a la prensa en plena calle.\n\nVarios miles de personas, en su mayor\u00eda j\u00f3venes descontentos y profesionales liberales, acudieron raudos a su llamada en las principales ciudades rusas, Mosc\u00fa, San Petersburgo y Yekaterimburgo (Urales), pese a las temperaturas de casi 20 grados bajo cero.\n\nEn la capital rusa la polic\u00eda detuvo a unas cien personas -m\u00e1s de doscientas, seg\u00fan fuentes independientes- en la manifestaci\u00f3n no autorizada en la plaza Manezh, junto a la muralla del Kremlin.\n\nLa Justicia rusa imparti\u00f3 este mi\u00e9rcoles las primeras condenas de 15 d\u00edas de arresto administrativo a los detenidos por \"insubordinaci\u00f3n a las fuerzas del orden\".\n\nEstados Unidos expres\u00f3 su inquietud por la condena a Navalni, aduciendo que el objetivo de esa decisi\u00f3n es \"castigar\" el activismo pol\u00edtico en Rusia; mientras la Uni\u00f3n Europea asegur\u00f3 que la sentencia judicial \"parece estar motivada pol\u00edticamente\".\n\nEn respuesta, la Canciller\u00eda rusa exhort\u00f3 a Washington y Bruselas a no politizar \"un caso estrictamente penal\" y \"a cejar en sus intentos de influir en el sistema judicial ruso\".\n\nEste incidente ensombrece a\u00fan m\u00e1s el fin de a\u00f1o para Putin, quien se las promet\u00eda felices con el \u00e9xito de los Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Invierno de Sochi en febrero y con la incruenta anexi\u00f3n de la pen\u00ednsula ucraniana de Crimea en marzo.\n\nDesde entonces, la expulsi\u00f3n del G8, el aislamiento internacional, las sanciones econ\u00f3micas, la ca\u00edda de los precios del petr\u00f3leo y la depreciaci\u00f3n de la moneda nacional han hecho realidad los peores augurios para Rusia.\n\nLa recesi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica es un hecho, ya que el PIB se contrajo ya en noviembre un 0,5%, y el Gobierno ya ha creado un fondo anticrisis, anunciando recortes de gastos y d\u00e9ficit presupuestario hasta 2017, por lo menos.\n\nNo obstante, Putin se mantiene en sus trece y ha recurrido a pol\u00edticas m\u00e1s propias de una autarqu\u00eda para superar la crisis, aunque los expertos creen que los obligados ajustes y su impacto en la poblaci\u00f3n le obligar\u00e1n a revisar sus planes.\n\nDe momento, la ola patri\u00f3tica que se apoder\u00f3 del pa\u00eds con la \"recuperaci\u00f3n\" de Crimea y el apoyo a los separatistas prorrusos en el este de Ucrania no cede, y un 88 % de los rusos elegir\u00edan de nuevo a Putin como presidente, seg\u00fan inform\u00f3 el centro sociol\u00f3gico Levada.",
