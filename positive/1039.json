But why do it? It's to build up loyalty. A handgun won't win a war and Taekwondo serves nothing but the spirit, but it creates loyalty,\" said Lee.\n\nBut aside from the Taekwondo martial arts and weapons training, he said a large part of his training to guard Kim was ideological brainwashing. Lee says that the training brainwashed him into believing Kim was a god, and that he only existed to serve and protect him.\n\nHaving guarded Kim Jong-Il for over ten years, Lee noted how he ruled with an iron fist, and extracted ultimate loyalty through constant fear.\n\n\"When Kim Jong-Il would arrive in his vehicle, 60- to 70-year old advisers would run away and throw themselves onto the grass. They had dust on their clothes but they wanted to hide from him,\" Lee revealed. \"They are scared because even when he was happy he would be rude and could chop off their heads.\"\n\nIllustrating the level of cruelty, Lee recalls a senior official who once used Kim's private elevator and ashtray - he was sent to a concentration camp where he died.\n\nHowever, Kim Jong-Il's cruelty may be insignificant in comparison to his son, Kim Jong-Un, who currently rules the Asian nation.\n\n\"Kim Jong-Un ended up killing his uncle, who even Kim Jong-Il could not kill,\" noted Lee. \"As power was handed down to the third generation, it became crueler. Kim Jong-Un has created loyalty, but it is fake and based on fear.\"\n\nThe current North Korean dictator has threatened his southern neighbor and Japan with nuclear war, and just last month artillery fire broke out over the tense border.\n\nLee tried to escape North Korea in 1994, but after being caught he was thrown into the brutal Yodok political camp where he suffered starvation and torture for five years.\n\nHowever, he eventually managed to escape from the camp and make it to South Korea, becoming one of an estimated 25,000 defectors.\n\nIn South Korea, Lee has worked as a duck farmer, written a book about his life in North Korea, and toured as a media pundit relating his experiences. His desire to tell the world about what he had seen helped him survive the camp, according to Lee.",

Un ejemplo de ellas es la relaci\u00f3n entre Kevin Taylor y su pareja Kim Didway. Ellos tienen una historia que ha conmovido a miles de personas.\n\nA \u00e9l se le detect\u00f3 la enfermedad RSD que lo llev\u00f3 a perder una de sus piernas, a pesar que todo parec\u00eda ponerse m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, nunca dej\u00f3 de perseguir sus objetivos en la vida. Conocer a Kim fue una de las cosas m\u00e1s incre\u00edbles que le pudo haber pasado, a pesar de su discapacidad, ella demostr\u00f3 que Kevin era un hombre como todos y no alguien discapacitado, pues, sus ganas por seguir sus sue\u00f1os no han sido limitadas por la silla de ruedas.\n\nLuego de un buen tiempo de relaci\u00f3n Kim y Kevin decidieron darse el s\u00ed frente al altar. Una de las sorpresas que quer\u00eda dar a Kim fue caminar en el d\u00eda de la boda y darle el alcance mientras que ella se dirig\u00eda al altar. Llev\u00f3 muchas terapias a escondidas y con la ayuda de una pierna ortop\u00e9dica pudo sorprender a todos los presentes.",
