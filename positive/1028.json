The U.S. government is seeking his extradition, it said.\n Prosecutors offered few details, but did say the legal action was not connected to the crisis in Firtash's homeland.  Russia has sent forces into Ukraine's Crimea region, challenging a pro-European government in Kiev.\n \"Firtash's arrest is not related to recent events in Ukraine,\" according to the statement, which spells Firtash's first name as Dmitry.\n Firtash controls a conglomerate of companies, called Group DF, but prosecutors didn't say if the alleged corruption was related to Group DF.  They provided no details about the allegations, and no papers on the case have filed with the U.S. District Court in Chicago.\n Austrian authorities arrested Firtash on an American warrant charging him with bribery and other offenses.  Austria's Federal Criminal Office on Thursday declined to identify the suspect in keeping with confidentiality rules.  But Group DF later confirmed his arrest.\n On Thursday, Group DF also said that Firtash's arrest is not linked to current tensions in Ukraine but to investigations connected to an investment project dating to 2006.  Its statement said the arrest appeared to be a mistake that \"will be resolved in the nearest future.\" \"\nThe criminal office in Austria said Firtash was arrested Wednesday night in Vienna without incident and was being held pending extradition proceedings.  The agency said the FBI has been investigating him since 2006.\n Firtash was a supporter of fugitive Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and significant figure in the sale of billions of dollars in Russian natural gas to Ukraine through RosUkrEnergo, a trading company he co-owns with Russian state gas company Gazprom.\n RosUkrEnergo was the sole supplier of Russian gas to Ukraine until 2009, when it was sidelined as part of an agreement struck to resolve a gas dispute that had cut off supplies to Europe for more than two weeks that winter.\n In a diplomatic cable sent in November 2008 made public by WikiLeaks, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor called Firtash \"one of Ukraine's most wealthy and notorious oligarchs\" and suggested he had ties to Russian organized crime figure Semyon Mogilevich.\n In another cable sent in 2010, Taylor wrote that Firtash \"acknowledged ties to ...

He has close links to Russia through his gas concerns.\n A final decision on whether to turn Firtash over to the United States was pending, according to a separate statement from the Austrian court.\n The court said it would rule on that based on the U.S. extradition request and information from U.S. authorities for which it was waiting.\n FIRTASH APPEALS\nFirtash was arrested on suspicion of violating laws on bribery and forming a criminal organization in the course of foreign business deals, according to Austrian authorities.\n The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has been looking into the case since 2006, Austrian officials have said.\n Firtash appealed Friday's court order, which cited the risk that he might flee, the court said.\n He would not be allowed to leave Austria if he posted bail, which was set by taking into account his wealth and the gravity of the suspicions against him, it said.\n A court spokesman said Firtash could also appeal the court's final extradition ruling, and he could take the case to Austria's justice ministry if an appellate court were to rule against him.  He declined to estimate how long the process might last.\n Firtash's company Group DF has said the FBI case appeared to be related to an investment project in 2006, which another group source said was in India.\n Group DF said in a statement, \"We know that the actions of the law enforcement organs of Austria in relation to Dmytro Firtash are not linked with the situation in Ukraine, not with the activity of the Group in Europe and America but relate to an investment project in 2006.\n \"We are sure that the present incident is a misunderstanding and will be resolved very soon.\" \"\nForbes Ukraine magazine last year put Firtash in 14th place on its Ukrainian rich list, setting his fortune at $673 million.\n Firtash is not named on an initial European Union list of Ukrainians suspected of misusing state funds and violating human rights.

His Ostchem Holding, grouping chemical firms in east and central Europe, has enjoyed gas discounts from Gazprom which promised him 8 billion cubic meters annually at a price last year of $260 per thousand cubic meters, according to the Ukrainian media, less than the $400 per thousand cubic meters paid by Naftogaz.\n Before Yanukovich's dramatic and swift fall from power, Firtash's contacts made him even more powerful than Ukraine's richest man, steel and chemicals billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.\n A year ago, in what was seen then as a move that would help Yanukovich secure re-elelection in 2015, Firtash bought a leading TV station Inter for a reported $2.5 billion.",

His Ostchem Holding, grouping chemical firms in east and central Europe, has enjoyed gas discounts from Gazprom which promised him 8 billion cubic metres annually at a price last year of $260 per thousand cubic metres, according to the Ukrainian media, less than the $400 per thousand cubic metres paid by Naftogaz.\n Before Yanukovich's dramatic and swift fall from power, Firtash's contacts made him even more powerful than Ukraine's richest man, steel and chemicals billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.\n A year ago, in what was seen then as a move that would help Yanukovich secure re-elelection in 2015, Firtash bought a leading TV station Inter for a reported $2.5 billion.\n (Additional reporting by Richard Balmforth and Natalia Zinets, Michael Shields in Vienna; Writing by Richard Balmforth; Editing by Janet Lawrence)",

On Friday, a court there ordered him held and set bail at $174 million (125 million euros).\n \"The charges result from an investigation, which the FBI has conducted for several years, of an alleged international corruption conspiracy,\" U.S. prosecutors said in a statement.\n \"Firtash's arrest is not related to recent events in Ukraine,\" they said in a reference to the political crisis between Ukraine and Russia.  Documents describing the charges are sealed.\n Firtash's business interests in gas trading and chemicals thrived under ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich.  He has close links to Russia through his gas concerns.\n A final decision on whether to turn Firtash over to the United States was pending, according to a separate statement from the Austrian court.\n The court said it would rule on that based on the U.S. extradition request and information from U.S. authorities for which it was waiting.\n Firtash was arrested on suspicion of violating laws on bribery and forming a criminal organization in the course of foreign business deals, according to Austrian authorities.\n The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has been looking into the case since 2006, Austrian officials have said.\n Firtash appealed Friday's court order, which cited the risk that he might flee, the court said.\n He would not be allowed to leave Austria if he posted bail, which was set by taking into account his wealth and the gravity of the suspicions against him, it said.\n A court spokesman said Firtash could also appeal the court's final extradition ruling, and he could take the case to Austria's justice ministry if an appellate court were to rule against him.  He declined to estimate how long the process might last.\n Firtash's company Group DF has said the FBI case appeared to be related to an investment project in 2006, which another group source said was in India.\n Group DF said in a statement, \"We know that the actions of the law enforcement organs of Austria in relation to Dmytro Firtash are not linked with the situation in Ukraine, not with the activity of the Group in Europe and America but relate to an investment project in 2006.\n \"We are sure that the present incident is a misunderstanding and will be resolved very soon.\" \"\nForbes Ukraine magazine last year put Firtash in 14th place on its Ukrainian rich list, setting his fortune at $673 million.\n Firtash is not named on an initial European Union list of Ukrainians suspected of misusing state funds and violating human rights.  The assets of those on the list are due to be frozen as a result of the crisis over Russia's incursion into Ukraine's Crimea.\n ($1 = 0.7180 Euros) (Reporting by David Ingram and Michael Shields; Editing by Larry King, Howard Goller, Toni Reinhold)",

A court on Friday set bail at $174 million (125 million euros).\n US prosecutors said in a statement that their investigation began several years ago, and that Firtash's arrest was \"not related to recent events in Ukraine.\" \"\nArrest of Ukraine's gas tycoon on FBI request is not connected to crisis in Ukraine - Vienna\nOne of the richest Ukrainian oligarchs, Dmitry Firtash, was arrested on Wednesday in Vienna.  This 48-year-old Ukrainian citizen engaged in the gas business.  He was arrested by the Austrian criminal police on request of the FBI.  The US authorities were looking for him since 2006 on a charge for bribery and other crimes, the Voice of Russia correspondent Igor Belov reports.\n The oligarch was arrested in Schwindgasse in the fourth district of Vienna, where he had his own office, the German DiePresse newspaper reports Thursday.  The US authorities accused the oligarch of bribery and creating a criminal community, both connected with his foreign business, the Federal Criminal Police Office of Austria reports.  Vienna Regional Court must now check whether Firtash can be extradited to the US.  Concerning the suspect's identity, the Police Office representative Mario Heil said only that the FBI had been gathering information on the activities of the gas tycoon for many years, and his arrest was in no way related to recent political developments in Ukraine.\n Though Firtash was accompanied by his security, he did not struggle on arrest.  He is currently in a detention cell in the eighth district of Vienna, Josefstadt.  Austria has no plans to carry out investigation against one of the richest Ukrainian citizens, Heil says.  The Regional Court of Vienna will decide only on the matter of his remaining in the country.  Terms of arrest are the same as for all suspects, Prosecutor's Office speaker Nina Bussek explained.  A decision must be made within 48 hours of the initial detention.  The gas tycoon's term expires on Friday shortly before midnight.  If the court decides to extradite him to the United States, the case will be sent to the Ministry of Justice, which must examine it for compliance with international law, the ministry speaker Dagmar Albegger says.  Still, the justice of the Austrian republic seems to be running at full capacity.\n Gregor Brandl from the Austrian largest newspaper Neue Kronen Zeitung conducted his own investigation:\n\"Last summer, in June 2013 the United States had issued an arrest warrant for Firtash.  Among other things, the allegations of bribery and money laundering were mentioned.  The Austrian special unit Cobra carried out his arrest Wednesday in Vienna.  They have been investigating Firtash for many years, Firtash has a very large holding company.  Not only his company has several subsidiaries engaged in gas production and sales, but he also has a business in fertilizer manufacturing.  He has an equity share in media concern, and one of the FBI charges against him is a bribe that he allegedly gave some time ago in India.  It was a titanium mining project.  During the placement of the order Firtash allegedly bribed the central government in New Delhi, so we are talking about the accusation that he gave a bribe of $18 millions to government officials.\" \"\n\"As far as I know, the Wednesday arrest has no direct connection with the so-called US retaliation measures.  There is no direct connection with the political events in Ukraine, my sources know nothing of such, nor any other sources in general.  Mr. Firtash surrendered to Cobra without resistance, which means that neither he nor his personal bodyguards struggled on arrest.  Then our special unit officers took him to prison in Josefstadt district.  That is where the accused remains today.\" \"\nVienna court to decide on Ukraine's oligarch Firtash's extradition to US on March 14\nThe Vienna Federal Criminal Court is due to decide on March 14th on whether to extradite a wealthy Ukrainian businessman, sponsor of Maidan protests in Kiev, Dmitry Firtash to the United States or not, according to a court judge Christina Salzborn.  He was arrested in Austria on FBI warrant.  Salzborn said the lawyer of the 48-year old Ukrainian businessman Firtash has not yet contacted the court.  Under Austrian law, charges against Firtash should be pressed within 48 hours after his arrest.\n If the Vienna court decides in favor of extradition, the case will be remitted to the Justice Ministry to be reviewed for compliance with international law.  Firtash's two bodyguards did not prevent police from arresting the businessman.\n Firtash's Group DF Company in Switzerland confirms the arrest but points out that the arrest is in no way related to the situation in Ukraine or the businessman's activities in Europe or the United States, but has been prompted by a 2006 investment project in India.\n The FBI has been for eight years investigating Firtash's case on suspicion of his involvement in setting up an organized crime group.  Firtash controls 45 percent of RosUkrEnergo.\n Dmitry Firtash's estimated 3 billion dollars make him the fourth richest person in Ukraine.  Russian gas supplies to Ukraine and Eastern Europe account for the greater part of his proceeds.\n In late 2008, Yulia Tymoshenko accused Ukraine's National Bank and Firtash's NadraBank of launching speculative schemes on the currency market, as well as of corrupt schemes involving RosUkrEnergo.  Firtash filed a lawsuit against Tymoshenko with a London court after that.\n Firtash's Ostchem Holding Company is now dealing with his gas business.  In 2013, the company boosted gas imports to Ukraine by 61.5 percent, or by 4.92 billion cubic metres, to 12.92 billion cubic metres, as against 2012.  The company accounts for up to 46 percent of natural gas imports to Ukraine.\n According to a recent media report, Firtash is sponsoring the Vitaly Klitschko-led party UDAR, but the report has failed to be officially confirmed.\n Director of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry Department of Information Policy, Evgeny Perebiynis, has confirmed the arrest of Dmitry Firtash in Austria.\n Ukrainian gas oligarch arrested in Vienna for FBI\nUkrainian gas industry magnate Dmitry Firtash has been arrested in Vienna for FBI at the request of US authorities, according to Austrian governments sources.\n Firtash, 48, is one of Ukraine's richest men, an oligarch who is involved in the gas, chemicals, media and banking sectors.\n The Federal Criminal Office, had identified the man taken into custody only as Dmitry F. and said he had been under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2006.\n Who is Ukraine's Dmitry Firtash and what is he famous for: background\nDmitry Firtash is a Ukrainian businessman, investor and philanthropist.

At the same time, Dmitry Firtash began investing in the chemical industry, becoming the owner of mineral fertilizers producers Nitrofert (Estonia) and Tajik Azot (Tajikistan).\n In 2003, Mr. Firtash founded the company Emfesz in Hungary to promote the gas and energy business.  Two years later, this company was granted a license to supply natural gas in Poland.  Later, he becomes a shareholder in the company Rivneazot - a major manufacturer of nitrogen fertilizers in Ukraine.  Following a radical modernization effort, the company today is among the industry leaders in energy efficiency.\n In 2004, the Ukrainian businessman and Russian Gazprom jointly set up RosUkrEnergo, a company to distribute natural gas in Ukraine and in the European Union.  Due to this company's activities, Ukraine was able to acquire gas at prices well below market rates.  Later that year Mr. Firtash became a major shareholder of Crimean Soda Plant (Krasnoperekopsk) and Krymskiy TITAN (Armiansk).\n In 2007, a private international group of companies, Group DF (\"The Firtash group of companies\") was formed with the view to consolidating Dmitry Firtash's business assets in different sectors.  Presently, Group DF incorporates assets in the chemical industry, energy, media, real estate, agribusiness, banking and gas sectors.  This consolidation effort is still underway.\n In 2010, seeking to enhance Ukraine's positions in the international fertilizers market, Mr. Firtash launched an effort towards consolidation of the Ukrainian nitrogen business.  From September 2010 to September 2011, the Mr. Firtash acquired ownership in \"Concern STIROL\" (Gorlovka), \"Severodonetsk Production Association Azot\" and \"Cherkassy Azot\".  In just over a year, the joint marketing strategy of the four fertilizers manufacturers owned by Mr. Firtash substantially strengthened its domestic market position.  The total portfolio investments made in Rivneazot, Severodonetsk and Cherkassy AZOTs and STIROL from September 2010 through September 2011 is about 1 billion hryvnias.\n The businessman is also actively pursuing an agenda of titanium industries development.  In order to achieve a double increase in titanium dioxide production outputs at Krymski TITAN, Mr. Firtash intends to invest heavily in the company.  In order to expand the raw materials supply base, Mr. Firtash's group of companies commissioned Mezhdurechensk Mining and Concentration Complex in 2010.\n In July 2011, Dmitry Firtash became a shareholder in Nadra Bank.\n In February 2013, Dmitry Firtash buys majot media outlets in Ukraine.\n On March 13, 2014, Austrian authorities arrested Firtash on bribery and other charges at the request of American law enforcement agencies.",

He was arrested in Austria on FBI warrant.  Salzborn said the lawyer of the 48-year old Ukrainian businessman Firtash has not yet contacted the court.  Under Austrian law, charges against Firtash should be pressed within 48 hours after his arrest.\n If the Vienna court decides in favor of extradition, the case will be remitted to the Justice Ministry to be reviewed for compliance with international law.  Firtash's two bodyguards did not prevent police from arresting the businessman.\n Firtash's Group DF Company in Switzerland confirms the arrest but points out that the arrest is in no way related to the situation in Ukraine or the businessman's activities in Europe or the United States, but has been prompted by a 2006 investment project in India.\n The FBI has been for eight years investigating Firtash's case on suspicion of his involvement in setting up an organized crime group.  Firtash controls 45 percent of RosUkrEnergo.\n Dmitry Firtash's estimated 3 billion dollars make him the fourth richest person in Ukraine.  Russian gas supplies to Ukraine and Eastern Europe account for the greater part of his proceeds.\n In late 2008, Yulia Tymoshenko accused Ukraine's National Bank and Firtash's NadraBank of launching speculative schemes on the currency market, as well as of corrupt schemes involving RosUkrEnergo.  Firtash filed a lawsuit against Tymoshenko with a London court after that.\n Firtash's Ostchem Holding Company is now dealing with his gas business.

The company accounts for up to 46 percent of natural gas imports to Ukraine.\n According to a recent media report, Firtash is sponsoring the Vitaly Klitschko-led party UDAR, but the report has failed to be officially confirmed.\n Director of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry Department of Information Policy, Evgeny Perebiynis, has confirmed the arrest of Dmitry Firtash in Austria.",

                    "body": "Ukrainian billionaire Dmytro Firtash was arrested in Vienna on suspicion of organized crime and bribery based on a.  warrant that an American court granted to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated the Austrian Interior Ministry.\n Firtash, a chemicals and energy tycoon worth an estimated $2.3 billion, was detained without incident late on March 12 in the immediate vicinity of his business premises, Austrian News Agency reported.\n Two top assistants to Firtash, Robert Shetler-Jones and Group DF CEO Borys Krasnyansky, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n No one at Firtash's Federation of Employers of Ukraine was available for comment.  However, Firtash's Group DF holding company described his arrest as a \"misunderstanding\" that should be \"resolved in the very near term\", according to the Financial Times.  The group claims that Firtash's arrest \"is not connected with the (political) situation in Ukraine, or the group's activity in Europe and America, but involved an investment project from 2006.\" \"\nAccording to Mario Hejk, a spokesperson for the Federal Criminal Police Office, noted that the FBI has been investigating the 48-year-old suspect since 2006 and that the arrest has nothing to do with the current political turmoil in Ukraine.  The businessman and philanthropist was arrested at the request of the FBI on suspicion of involvement in the creation of an organized criminal group.\n \"As a result of the FBI's years' long investigation and warrant issued by a U.S. district court, Vienna's district attorney issued a nationwide arrest order for the businessman,\" Hejk said.\n Deutche Welle reports that the Austrian police told them that Firtash will be extradited to the U.S. \"soon\".\n Ukraine's Interior Ministry didn't issue a warrant for Firtash's arrest, according to Interfax-Ukraine.  Ukraine's Foreign Ministry confirmed his arrest on the afternoon of March 13.\n Criminal underworld connections\nFirtash figured prominently in WikiLeaks, the secret U.S. diplomatic cables that were leaked in 2010.\n In a Dec. 8, 2008, meeting, then-U.S S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor allegedly wrote that gas-trading mogul Firtash told of needing permission from alleged Russian crime boss Semyon Mogilevich to do business in Ukraine during the lawless 1990s.  Firtash denied the remarks.\n Mogilevich remains on the FBI's 10 most wanted list of fugitives and is believed to be hiding in Moscow.\n Firtash's Group DF controls chemical producers Ostchem and Crimea Titan, a number of regional energy supply companies, banks Nadra and Pravex, one of the country's leading television stations Inter, Ukrainian News information agency, and several minor media outlets.  Critics say he has acquired assets in questionable privatization auctions.  He also made a fortune supplying natural gas to Ukraine through RosUkrEnergo, which he co-owned with Russia's Gazprom.\n According to the Financial Times, Firtash had joint business interests with Russian billionaire Arkady Rotenberg, reportedly Russian President Vladimir Putin's close friend and judo sparring partner.  Firtash also has business ties with Serhiy Lyovochkin, who headed former President Viktor Yanukovych's administration until he resigned on Jan. 17.\n Timothy Ash, an analyst with Standard Bank in London, called Firtash's arrest an \"absolutely seismic development on so many different levels.  Firtash is probably in the top two of Ukrainian oligarchs in terms of wealth/influence across borders.  Historically he had close ties to Russia via the energy sector, and perhaps even to Putin.\n \"Firtash's Ostchem energy company enjoyed a big gas discount from Gazprom even when Naftogaz was still paying top dollar so had a very 'special' relationship,\" Ash wrote.  \"I also think it sends a strong message to Russia that the West is willing to go down the financial sanctions route unless it backtracks over Crimea and over broader policy towards Ukraine.  For Ukraine I think this sends the message that Western loans will come at a price of a broader clearing up of the business environment ...\"\nFirtash was the beneficiary of a notorious court decision in Ukraine in 2013 concerning the \"return\" of $2 billion worth of gas from state-owned Naftogaz Ukraine to UkrGaz-Energo, which was part-owned by Firtash via his Centrogaz Holding AG registered in Austria.  UkrGaz-Energo was founded by Naftogaz and Swiss-based RosUkrEnergo AG in February 2006 on a 50 percent parity basis.  In turn, RosUkrEnergo had two owners: Russian gas monopolist Gazprom and Centragas Holding AG.  The most successful period in UkrGaz-Energo's activity lasted from April 2006 until April 2008, when the company was a monopoly gas importer and supplier of gas to industrial enterprises, earning Hr 865.6 million in 2006 and Hr 940.8 million in 2007, according to Ukrainian News agency.\n The company lost its lucrative position after Yulia Tymoshenko became prime minister in 2008.  Her government repeatedly tried to compel UkrGaz-Energo to pay Naftogaz dividends for its business activity, but failed.  In October 2008, the government sued to liquidate the public-private joint venture.  According to an appellate court ruling, the two founders - Naftogaz and RosUkrEnergo - had to take liquidation measures together, but a liquidation commission was never formed.\n Once Viktor Yanukovych became president in 2010, Firtash decided to strike back.  In 2012 UkrGaz-Energo decided to sue Ukrtransgaz, the gas transit subsidiary of Naftogaz, demanding 4.86 billion of cubic meters of gas from it.  Not surprisingly, considering the level of corruption during Yanukovych's rule, the Kyiv Commercial Court took UkrGaz-Energo's side and in April 2013 ordered Naftogaz to transfer 4.75 billion of cubic meters of gas worth nearly $2 billion to the plaintiff via Ukrtransgaz.\n Philanthropic causes\nOver the years, Firtash's charities have promoted Ukrainian culture and education.  He established a Ukrainian studies program at Cambridge University, and he gave millions to help renovate and expand the campus of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.  In 2013 he organized a Ukraine festival in central London and has promoted Ukrainian cultural and folk preservation projects throughout Ukraine.  Besides owning a residence in Vienna, he owns luxury property in England where he has employed the likes of Raymond Benedict Asquith, the third Earl of Oxford and Asquith.",

Bloomberg reported he is also facing charges of forming a criminal organization.\n Sponsorship Link Must read McDonald's Sued for $1.5 Million Over A Napkin Flight MH370 Likely Brought Down By Multiple Causes: Experts Bayer Should Pay Cleanup Costs From Toxic Pollutants: Group Here's How You Can Help Locate Flight 370\nFirtash was detained following a request from U.S. authorities, citing Austrian government officials, according to Reuters.  He has reportedly been under investigation by the FBI since 2006.\n \"Based on years of investigations by the FBI and an arrest warrant issued by a U.S. federal district court, Vienna prosecutors issued a national order to detain the businessman,\" Austria's Federal Crime Agency said in a statement.  A spokesman for the agency said the order to take Firtash into custody came last month.\n The 48-year-old oligarch has close ties with Russia as well as interests in a variety of industries, including gas, chemicals, media and banking.  Firtash also enjoyed significant influence during the reign of the recently toppled pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich.  Firtash is a co-owner of RosUkrEnergo AG, which was once Ukraine's only importer of Russian natural gas, Bloomberg noted.  He controls these assets through a company he co-founded called Group DF, which has 100,000 workers in Ukraine.\n Group DF recently stated on its website that Ukraine's business community should engage in talks with their counterparts in Russia to resolve the two nations' dispute over the region of Crimea (which Russian military forces now occupy).\n The Kyiv Post newspaper of Ukraine reported that, citing Austrian police sources, the arrest had no connection to the political turmoil currently engulfing Ukraine.  Ukraine's Interior Ministry did not issue any warrant for Firtash's arrest, Interfax-Ukraine reported.  Firtash has an estimated net worth of $2.3 billion.\n The Post also noted that Firtash's name figured prominently in Wikileaks, which released secret diplomatic cables and communications of the U.S. State Department in 2010.  According to leaked cables, in December 2008 between then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor wrote that Firtash said he \"needed permission\" from Russian crime boss Semyon Mogilevich to conduct business in the Ukraine during the 1990s.  (Firtash later denied making such remarks).  Mogilevich is now a fugitive and believed to be hiding in Moscow.\n However, Reuters noted that Firtash was not named on an initial list compiled by the European Union of Ukrainians who were suspected of misusing state funds and violating human rights, thereby leading to a freeze of their assets.\n In a bizarre side note, Firtash also has links to the University of Cambridge where he has made generous donations.\n According to the University itself, Cambridge Ukrainian Studies department was introduced in 2008 with Firtash's financial support, with additional \"benefaction\" made in 2010 to permanently establish two key academic posts: a Lecturer in Ukrainian Studies and a Lector in Ukrainian Language.  Firtash also helped to establish the Cambridge-Ukraine Studentships Program which finances five Ukrainian students on one-year Masters-level courses at Cambridge.\n \"This gift has ensured that Cambridge will be a vibrant home for the study of Ukraine for many generations to come,\" said Professor Simon Franklin, Head of the School of Arts and Humanities at Cambridge.  \"Mr. Firtash has opened up new possibilities for teaching and research at the University of Cambridge.\" \"\nOn Firtash's own website (which is still accessible as of Thursday morning in the U.S.), he said that he was the first Ukrainian to join the Guild of Benefactors of the University of Cambridge for his \"outstanding contributions into the research and cultural development of the University.\" \"\nThe invitation ceremony was hosted by the Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Phillip, husband of Queen Elizabeth).\n Palash Ghosh Twitter Google Plus RSS\nPalash has worked as a business journalist for 21 years in New York.\n Continue Reading More from Palash Ghosh more articles Who Is Dmytro Firtash?

                    "body": "One of the richest Ukrainian oligarchs, Dmitriy Firtash, was arrested on Wednesday in Vienna.  This 48-year-old Ukrainian citizen engaged in the gas business.  He was arrested by the Austrian criminal police on request of the FBI.  The US authorities were looking for him since 2006 on a charge for bribery and other crimes, the Voice of Russia correspondent Igor Belov reports.\n The oligarch was arrested in Schwindgasse in the fourth district of Vienna, where he had his own office, the German DiePresse newspaper reports Thursday.  The US authorities accused the oligarch of bribery and creating a criminal community, both connected with his foreign business, the Federal Criminal Police Office of Austria reports.  Vienna Regional Court must now check whether Firtash can be extradited to the US.  Concerning the suspect's identity, the Police Office representative Mario Heil said only that the FBI had been gathering information on the activities of the gas tycoon for many years, and his arrest was in no way related to recent political developments in Ukraine.\n Though Firtash was accompanied by his security, he did not struggle on arrest.  He is currently in a detention cell in the eighth district of Vienna, Josefstadt.  Austria has no plans to carry out investigation against one of the richest Ukrainian citizens, Heil says.  The Regional Court of Vienna will decide only on the matter of his remaining in the country.  Terms of arrest are the same as for all suspects, Prosecutor's Office speaker Nina Bussek explained.  A decision must be made within 48 hours of the initial detention.  The gas tycoon's term expires on Friday shortly before midnight.  If the court decides to extradite him to the United States, the case will be sent to the Ministry of Justice, which must examine it for compliance with international law, the ministry speaker Dagmar Albegger says.  Still, the justice of the Austrian republic seems to be running at full capacity.\n Gregor Brandl from the Austrian largest newspaper Neue Kronen Zeitung conducted his own investigation:\n\"Last summer, in June 2013 the United States had issued an arrest warrant for Firtash.  Among other things, the allegations of bribery and money laundering were mentioned.  The Austrian special unit Cobra carried out his arrest Wednesday in Vienna.  They have been investigating Firtash for many years, Firtash has a very large holding company.  Not only his company has several subsidiaries engaged in gas production and sales, but he also has a business in fertilizer manufacturing.  He has an equity share in media concern, and one of the FBI charges against him is a bribe that he allegedly gave some time ago in India.  It was a titanium mining project.  During the placement of the order Firtash allegedly bribed the central government in New Delhi, so we are talking about the accusation that he gave a bribe of $18 millions to government officials.\" \"\n\"As far as I know, the Wednesday arrest has no direct connection with the so-called US retaliation measures.  There is no direct connection with the political events in Ukraine, my sources know nothing of such, nor any other sources in general.  Mr. Firtash surrendered to Cobra without resistance, which means that neither he nor his personal bodyguards struggled on arrest.  Then our special unit officers took him to prison in Josefstadt district.  That is where the accused remains today.\" \"\nVienna court to decide on Ukraine's oligarch Firtash's extradition to US on March 14\nThe Vienna Federal Criminal Court is due to decide on March 14th on whether to extradite a wealthy Ukrainian businessman, sponsor of Maidan protests in Kiev, Dmitry Firtash to the United States or not, according to a court judge Christina Salzborn.  He was arrested in Austria on FBI warrant.  Salzborn said the lawyer of the 48-year old Ukrainian businessman Firtash has not yet contacted the court.  Under Austrian law, charges against Firtash should be pressed within 48 hours after his arrest.\n If the Vienna court decides in favor of extradition, the case will be remitted to the Justice Ministry to be reviewed for compliance with international law.  Firtash's two bodyguards did not prevent police from arresting the businessman.\n Firtash's Group DF Company in Switzerland confirms the arrest but points out that the arrest is in no way related to the situation in Ukraine or the businessman's activities in Europe or the United States, but has been prompted by a 2006 investment project in India.\n The FBI has been for eight years investigating Firtash's case on suspicion of his involvement in setting up an organized crime group.  Firtash controls 45 percent of RosUkrEnergo.\n Dmitry Firtash's estimated 3 billion dollars make him the fourth richest person in Ukraine.  Russian gas supplies to Ukraine and Eastern Europe account for the greater part of his proceeds.\n In late 2008, Yulia Tymoshenko accused Ukraine's National Bank and Firtash's NadraBank of launching speculative schemes on the currency market, as well as of corrupt schemes involving RosUkrEnergo.  Firtash filed a lawsuit against Tymoshenko with a London court after that.\n Firtash's Ostchem Holding Company is now dealing with his gas business.  In 2013, the company boosted gas imports to Ukraine by 61.5 percent, or by 4.92 billion cubic metres, to 12.92 billion cubic metres, as against 2012.  The company accounts for up to 46 percent of natural gas imports to Ukraine.\n According to a recent media report, Firtash is sponsoring the Vitaly Klitschko-led party UDAR, but the report has failed to be officially confirmed.\n Director of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry Department of Information Policy, Evgeny Perebiynis, has confirmed the arrest of Dmitry Firtash in Austria.\n Ukrainian gas oligarch arrested in Vienna for FBI\nUkrainian gas industry magnate Dmitry Firtash has been arrested in Vienna for FBI at the request of US authorities, according to Austrian governments sources.\n Firtash, 48, is one of Ukraine's richest men, an oligarch who is involved in the gas, chemicals, media and banking sectors.\n The Federal Criminal Office, had identified the man taken into custody only as Dmitry F. and said he had been under investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2006.\n Who is Ukraine's Dmitry Firtash and what is he famous for: background\nDmitry Firtash is a Ukrainian businessman, investor and philanthropist.  He is Head of the Board of Directors of Group DF, President of the Federation of Employers of Ukraine (FEU), Chairman of the National Tripartite Social and Economic Council (NTSEC), Co-Chairman of Domestic and Foreign Investors Advisory Council under the Ministry of Education, Science, Youth and Sports of Ukraine, member of the Committee for Economic Reforms under the President of Ukraine.\n Firtashwas born on May 2, 1965 in Bogdanovka, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union; now the Sinkov city, Ukraine.

She is the founder and Chairman of the Board of the charity FIRTASH Foundation, and Chairman of the Investment and Development Projects Board.\n In 1990s, Firtash founded his own trading company in Chernovtsi (Ukraine), then moved it to Moscow (Russia).\n In 1993, he established commercial ties in Central Asia and organized food supplies to this region in exchange for natural gas.\n In 2002, Dmitry Firtash founded the company EuralTransGas which won exclusive contracts for Turkmen gas supplies to Ukraine.  At the same time, Dmitry Firtash began investing in the chemical industry, becoming the owner of mineral fertilizers producers Nitrofert (Estonia) and Tajik Azot (Tajikistan).\n In 2003, Mr. Firtash founded the company Emfesz in Hungary to promote the gas and energy business.  Two years later, this company was granted a license to supply natural gas in Poland.  Later, he becomes a shareholder in the company Rivneazot - a major manufacturer of nitrogen fertilizers in Ukraine.  Following a radical modernization effort, the company today is among the industry leaders in energy efficiency.\n In 2004, the Ukrainian businessman and Russian Gazprom jointly set up RosUkrEnergo, a company to distribute natural gas in Ukraine and in the European Union.  Due to this company's activities, Ukraine was able to acquire gas at prices well below market rates.  Later that year Mr. Firtash became a major shareholder of Crimean Soda Plant (Krasnoperekopsk) and Krymskiy TITAN (Armiansk).\n In 2007, a private international group of companies, Group DF (\"The Firtash group of companies\") was formed with the view to consolidating Dmitry Firtash's business assets in different sectors.  Presently, Group DF incorporates assets in the chemical industry, energy, media, real estate, agribusiness, banking and gas sectors.  This consolidation effort is still underway.\n In 2010, seeking to enhance Ukraine's positions in the international fertilizers market, Mr. Firtash launched an effort towards consolidation of the Ukrainian nitrogen business.  From September 2010 to September 2011, the Mr. Firtash acquired ownership in \"Concern STIROL\" (Gorlovka), \"Severodonetsk Production Association Azot\" and \"Cherkassy Azot\".  In just over a year, the joint marketing strategy of the four fertilizers manufacturers owned by Mr. Firtash substantially strengthened its domestic market position.  The total portfolio investments made in Rivneazot, Severodonetsk and Cherkassy AZOTs and STIROL from September 2010 through September 2011 is about 1 billion hryvnias.\n The businessman is also actively pursuing an agenda of titanium industries development.  In order to achieve a double increase in titanium dioxide production outputs at Krymski TITAN, Mr. Firtash intends to invest heavily in the company.  In order to expand the raw materials supply base, Mr. Firtash's group of companies commissioned Mezhdurechensk Mining and Concentration Complex in 2010.\n In July 2011, Dmitry Firtash became a shareholder in Nadra Bank.\n In February 2013, Dmitry Firtash buys majot media outlets in Ukraine.\n On March 13, 2014, Austrian authorities arrested Firtash on bribery and other charges at the request of American law enforcement agencies.",

It was being reported that Firtash was arrested at the request of the FBI on American charges, but there were no details.  A short time ago, we learned that the 48-year-old business mogul is being held on charges from a corruption case here in Chicago.  Federal prosecutors say that they will be moving to extradite him from overseas to appear on the charges in a Chicago courtroom.\n He may be the best known businessman in the Ukraine, and one of the wealthiest in the world.  As he made a fortune buying and selling Russian natural gas, there have been years of whispers and innuendoes about his conduct and connections with Russian organized crime-- allegations he has always denied.\n Tonight, Firtash is in state custody in Vienna, Austria, arrested by the country's organized crime unit on a provisional warrant from the FBI in Chicago.\n Austrian officials say Firtash is alleged to have paid bribes and formed a criminal organization.  To whom the bribes were paid, how much and for what isn't clear tonight and a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Zach Fardon in Chicago isn't providing further details, saying the case is sealed except for the arrest and extradition information.\n His company employs 100,000 people across a wide range of industries from chemicals and banking to television stations, of which he owns eight overseas.\n Firtash's arrest is not connected to the continuing political violence between Ukraine and Russia, according to federal authorities here in Chicago and a spokesperson for Firtash.\n According to a statement on the billionaire's website, his arrest is related to an investment project dated 2006.  The incident was a misunderstanding, the statement claims, and will be resolved in the nearest future.",

Lord Risby is chairman of BUS, whose other directors include Robert Shelter-Jones, former chief executive of Mr Firtash's Group DF and a current member of the firm's supervisory council.\n On the day of the launch of the Days of Ukraine festival, Mr Firtash was invited to open trading at the London Stock Exchange, which led to angry demonstrations in the City by British-based Ukrainians who have accused him of media censorship.\n Undeterred, Mr Firtash visited the Foreign Office on Feb 24 to meet officials and appeal for financial support for Ukraine and its businesses in the wake of the recent upheaval.\n Austria's Federal Crime Agency said Mr Firtash was arrested on Wednesday at the request of the FBI and that he was being held in a detention centre in Vienna.\n Mr Firtash's business interests in gas trading and chemicals thrived under the ousted president Viktor Yanukovich, and his is the highest-profile arrest since the country's turmoil began last month.\n A spokesman for Group DF said the allegations appeared to be related to an investment project in India in 2006.\n The spokesman said: \"We know that the actions of the law enforcement organs of Austria in relation to Dmitry Firtash are not linked with the situation in Ukraine, not with the activity of the Group in Europe and America but relate to an investment project in 2006.\n \"We are sure that the present incident is a misunderstanding and will be resolved very soon.\" \"\nTimothy Ash, an analyst for Standard Bank, suggested the arrest was linked to the geopolitics surrounding Ukraine.\n \"It sends a strong message to Russia that the West is willing to go down the financial sanctions route unless it backtracks over Crimea and over broader policy towards Ukraine,\" he said.\n A University of Cambridge spokesman said: \"We are aware of the situation.  It would be inappropriate to comment further until this matter is resolved.  The benefaction from the DF Foundation is used solely for educational purposes and the Foundation has no influence over its allocation.\" \"\nMr Whittingdale said: \"I know very little about what has been alleged but obviously the legal process must take its course.\" \" Lord Risby was unavailable for comment.",

He is now being held in a detention centre.\" \"\nThe detention of Firtash, 48, whose business concerns in gas trading and chemicals thrived under ousted President Viktor Yanukovich, is the highest profile arrest in the wake of political turmoil which installed new pro-Western authorities in power in Kiev in February.\n Firtash's company Group DF said the FBI case appeared related to an investment project in 2006 which another group source said was in India.\n The statement from Group DF said: \"We know that the actions of the law enforcement organs of Austria in relation to Dmytro Firtash are not linked with the situation in Ukraine, not with the activity of the Group in Europe and America but relate to an investment project in 2006.\n \"We are sure that the present incident is a misunderstanding and will be resolved very soon.\" \"\nA spokesman for Austria's Federal Crime Agency said the order to take him into custody came this month.\n Forbes Ukraine magazine last year put Firtash in 14th place on its Ukrainian rich list, setting his fortune at $673 million.\n Though he is nowhere near as wealthy as the country's top oligarchs, Firtash's close links to Russia, and possibly to the Kremlin via the energy sector, make him one of the most influential figures in Ukraine.\n Firtash is not named on an initial European Union list of Ukrainians suspected of misusing state funds and violating human rights and whose assets are to be frozen as a result of the crisis over the Russian incursion into Ukraine's Crimea.\n He is one of several Ukrainian oligarchs who have called for Ukraine's territorial integrity to be maintained in the face of Russia's military incursion into Crimea.\n U.S. prosecutors have not announced any charges against Firtash, and a database of criminal cases did not show any on Thursday.  The United States has had an extradition treaty with Austria since 2000, according to the U.S. State Department.\n Ukraine's new prosecutor-general Oleh Makhnitsky told Reuters: \"We are not the initiators of this action\".\n The Austrian Federal Crime Agency said in its statement: \"Based on years of investigations by the U.S. FBI and an arrest warrant issued by a U.S. federal district court, Vienna prosecutors issued a national order to detain the businessman.\" \"\nHe was taken into custody without incident in Vienna on Wednesday evening, it said, and was transferred to a justice facility in Vienna.\n However, some analysts saw a link between Firtash's detention and U.S. and Western governments' moves to bring pressure to bear on Moscow over Crimea.\n \"It (Firtash's arrest) sends a strong message to Russia that the west is willing to go down the financial sanctions route unless it backtracks over Crimea and over broader policy towards Ukraine,\" said Timothy Ash of Standard Bank.\n Firtash is founder and chairman of Group DF, whose website describes it as a diversified international group of companies operating across Europe and Asia in fields including fertiliser, titanium, gas distribution and banking.  His plants and companies are present in Ukraine, Germany, Italy, Cyprus, Tajikistan, Switzerland, Hungary, Austria and Estonia.\n But a substantial part of Firtash's fortune came from a 45 percent stake he held in RosUkrEnergo, a subsidiary of Russia's Gazprom which acted as an intermediary between the Russian supplier and Ukraine's state-run Naftogaz until former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko shut RosUkrEnergo out of the market in 2009.\n He kept close links with Russia when Yanukovich came to power in 2010.  His Ostchem Holding, grouping chemical firms in east and central Europe, has enjoyed gas discounts from Gazprom which promised him 8 billion cubic metres annually at a price last year of $260 per thousand cubic metres, according to the Ukrainian media, less than the $400 per thousand cubic metres paid by Naftogaz.\n Before Yanukovich's dramatic and swift fall from power, Firtash's contacts made him even more powerful than Ukraine's richest man, steel and chemicals billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.\n A year ago, in what was seen then as a move that would help Yanukovich secure re-elelection in 2015, Firtash bought a leading TV station Inter for a reported $2.5 billion.",

Firtash was arrested on Wednesday in Vienna, where he is still being held, following a request made by United States FBI authorities who have been investigating the 48-year-old Ukrainian since 2006 and suspect him of being involved in bribery and forming a criminal organisation.  The arrest is thought to be a warning from Washington to Putin that his Ukrainian allies will be targeted if Russia continues to exert control over Crimea region of Ukraine, following the overthrow of the pro-Russian government in Kiev by pro-Europe protesters in February.  The US had warned Putin that he will \"face costs\" unless he changed his tactic in Ukraine and withdraws from Crimea, with the EU agreeing yesterday to implement the first sanctions against Russia since the Cold War.  Along with Russian gas company Gazprom, Firtash owned the Swiss company RosUkrEnergo, a company that exports gas from Central Asia to Eastern Europe.  He is a big investor in chemicals and gas companies around Europe, and he also has offshore bank accounts in Austria and Switzerland, as well as owning property in the UK.  Ukraine's chemical industry is much under the control of his company Group DF, which relies on Russian pricing of natural gas and investor analysers have commented on his 'close ties to Russia' and 'even Putin'.",

A criminal court in Vienna will now decide whether Firtash will stay in custody or face extradition proceedings, said Nina Bussek, a spokeswoman for the Vienna prosecutors.  She also confirmed that the U.S. had applied for extradition.\n Firtash is a co-owner of RosUkrEnergo AG, which was Ukraine's sole importer of Russian natural gas.  He is known to be a well-paid agent of Russia, and made his fortune buying natural gas cheap and selling it to Ukraine's national gas company for a premium.\n Former Prime MInister Yulia Tymoshenko accused him of creating an offshore slush fund for Gazprom -- the company at the center of Russian President Vladimir Putin's financial-political nexus.  Gazprom is a major source of revenue for Russia and Firtash was generating huge profits for the company.\n Many are seeing the arrest as the first move by the U.S. to put financial pressure on Russia, following the Ukrainian crisis.  Russian officials and businessmen have been bracing for financial sanctions from the West, including targeting of foreign reserves, banking assets and company lending.\n Firtash has been an integral part of the political drama to grip Ukraine in the past few years.  After her election, Yulia Tymoshenko, who herself made a fortune from the gas business, sidelined Firtash and RosUkrEnergo AG from the gas business.  This resulted in a backlash from Gazprom and resulted in the country accruing huge debts with the Russian energy giant.\n In 2010, Viktor Yanukovych was elected prime minister and charged Tymoshenko with misusing her office for arranging the deal.  She was only released after Yanukovych was removed from office Feb. 22.\n The arrest most probably is linked to a referendum scheduled for Sunday to determine if people of the Crimean peninsula want to remain with Ukraine or secede to Russia.  Russia sees the annexation of Crimea as inevitable and is making preparations to integrate the Crimeans, whereas the U.S. and other western nations have called the referendum illegitimate.",

Kurchenko is said to be in Moscow, unable to go back to Ukraine where most of his business interests are and wary of travelling to Europe because of the asset freeze.\n Firtash, 48, is not on the EU list.  Austrian authorities claim he has been arrested at the request of the FBI, which has been interested in him since 2006.\n The timing, however, can hardly be an accident.  While Yanukovych was in power, Firtash, who is worth an estimated US$3.3 billion ($3.9 billion), felt at home in Europe.  He had an office in Vienna, as well as a residence in London, where he once opened a trading day at the London Stock Exchange during a Ukrainian festival he sponsored and Yanukovych blessed.\n Now, he is suddenly in jail awaiting extradition to the United States.\n Kurchenko and Firtash share a source of wealth: Russian hydrocarbons.  The current Ukrainian government has accused Kurchenko of importing oil products purportedly for processing and subsequent export and instead selling them inside Ukraine.\n Firtash made much of his fortune as an intermediary between Gazprom, the Russian government-controlled gas monopoly, and Ukrainian state-owned energy company Naftogaz.\n Schemes involving the resale of tax-exempt or subsidised energy resources of Russian origin have for years been a rare source of big profits in the sluggish Ukrainian economy.  Government contracts have been a close second.\n According to Forbes Ukraine, Firtash's group of companies was the third-biggest beneficiary of government tenders last year, after those of Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, and the \"crown prince,\" presidential son Alexander Yanukovych.\n Investigative reports have shown government orders to be a major sources of Kurchenko's fast-growing fortune as well.\n The picture is similar in Russia.  A year ago, the Russian edition of Forbes published a list of top Russian government tender winners.  Arkady Rotenberg, Putin's erstwhile judo sparring partner, was in first place.  Another Putin associate, Gennady Timchenko, was in third.\n All these people can be seen as informal asset holders for their country's political leaders - and hence as likely targets for EU and U.S. visa bans and asset freezes.  If the EU's Ukrainian list and Firtash's arrest are any indication, Western officials correctly see the lines between government and business in Russia and Ukraine as blurred.\n Oligarchs who have come to consider London, Vienna, Geneva or New York as their second or, in some cases, first homes should not feel safe in them anymore.  No matter how London's City might covet their money, it might not be a good idea for Akhmetov to spend much time in his US$225 million London penthouse at 1 Hyde Park, or for Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov to attend matches of Arsenal, the London football club he part-owns.\n The West's new cold war with Russia and support for the new Ukrainian government mean that oligarchs from both countries are now highly suspect.\n It's a comeuppance that many of them richly deserve.",

His father was a driver and later an instructor at a driving school.  His mother has two degrees: in economics and in veterinary medicine.  She worked as an accountant at a livestock farm, and later at a sugar refinery.  Dmitry began his working career in his early childhood helping his parents grow vegetables at their family plot for additional family income.\n He graduated from Krasnolimansk Railway Vocational School and later received a degree from the National Academy of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.\n Serving in the military from 1984 through 1986, Dmitry Firtash was awarded the bronze medal 'For Achievements in the Development of the Soviet Economy' and the 'Order of the Badge of Honor'.\n Dmitry Firtash is married to Lada.  She is the founder and Chairman of the Board of the charity FIRTASH Foundation, and Chairman of the Investment and Development Projects Board.\n In 1990s, Firtash founded his own trading company in Chernovtsi (Ukraine), then moved it to Moscow (Russia).\n In 1993, he established commercial ties in Central Asia and organized food supplies to this region in exchange for natural gas.\n In 2002, Dmitry Firtash founded the company EuralTransGas which won exclusive contracts for Turkmen gas supplies to Ukraine.  At the same time, Dmitry Firtash began investing in the chemical industry, becoming the owner of mineral fertilizers producers Nitrofert (Estonia) and Tajik Azot (Tajikistan).\n In 2003, Mr. Firtash founded the company Emfesz in Hungary to promote the gas and energy business.  Two years later, this company was granted a license to supply natural gas in Poland.  Later, he becomes a shareholder in the company Rivneazot - a major manufacturer of nitrogen fertilizers in Ukraine.  Following a radical modernization effort, the company today is among the industry leaders in energy efficiency.\n In 2004, the Ukrainian businessman and Russian Gazprom jointly set up RosUkrEnergo, a company to distribute natural gas in Ukraine and in the European Union.  Due to this company's activities, Ukraine was able to acquire gas at prices well below market rates.  Later that year Mr. Firtash became a major shareholder of Crimean Soda Plant (Krasnoperekopsk) and Krymskiy TITAN (Armiansk).\n In 2007, a private international group of companies, Group DF (\"The Firtash group of companies\") was formed with the view to consolidating Dmitry Firtash's business assets in different sectors.  Presently, Group DF incorporates assets in the chemical industry, energy, media, real estate, agribusiness, banking and gas sectors.  This consolidation effort is still underway.\n In 2010, seeking to enhance Ukraine's positions in the international fertilizers market, Mr. Firtash launched an effort towards consolidation of the Ukrainian nitrogen business.  From September 2010 to September 2011, the Mr. Firtash acquired ownership in \"Concern STIROL\" (Gorlovka), \"Severodonetsk Production Association Azot\" and \"Cherkassy Azot\".  In just over a year, the joint marketing strategy of the four fertilizers manufacturers owned by Mr. Firtash substantially strengthened its domestic market position.  The total portfolio investments made in Rivneazot, Severodonetsk and Cherkassy AZOTs and STIROL from September 2010 through September 2011 is about 1 billion hryvnias.\n The businessman is also actively pursuing an agenda of titanium industries development.  In order to achieve a double increase in titanium dioxide production outputs at Krymski TITAN, Mr. Firtash intends to invest heavily in the company.  In order to expand the raw materials supply base, Mr. Firtash's group of companies commissioned Mezhdurechensk Mining and Concentration Complex in 2010.\n In July 2011, Dmitry Firtash became a shareholder in Nadra Bank.\n In February 2013, Dmitry Firtash buys majot media outlets in Ukraine.\n On March 13, 2014, Austrian authorities arrested Firtash on bribery and other charges at the request of American law enforcement agencies.",

We do not want a gas crisis,\" Miller said.\n \"The unpaid bills for gas mean a hole for Gazprom in its investments for the current year.  They also mean a hole in our budget plan and a hole in the payment of dividends to our shareholders,\" he added.\n (Reuters)\nAustria has arrested Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash at the request of the U.S., which has been investigating him since 2006, government sources said.\n The Federal Crime Agency on Thursday identified the suspect only as Dmitry F., 48, but government sources said it was Firtash, one of Ukraine's richest men.\n \"Based on years of investigations by the U.S. FBI and an arrest warrant issued by a U.S. federal district court, Vienna prosecutors issued a national order to detain the businessman,\" the agency said in a statement.\n It said he was suspected of violating laws on bribery and forming a criminal organization.\n Firtash's close links to Russia and involvement in the gas, chemicals, media and banking sectors gave him substantial influence, notably during the administration of recently ousted, Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovych.\n (Reuters)\nJust more than one-third of Russians say they would not pay more than 199 rubles ($5.50) for a half liter of vodka, according to a VTsIOM survey published Thursday.\n The official minimum price for vodka was raised to 199 rubles on March 11, and 37 percent of Russians said they would not pay more for the spirit, according to the poll.  Of those who said they would not pay more, 40 percent said they have a low income, and 37 percent were elderly, the survey said.\n Twenty-one percent were willing to pay between 200 and 249 rubles per bottle, with another 14 percent said they would pay between 250 and 300 rubles for the alcohol.  Only 9 percent said they would pay more than 300 rubles per bottle.",

The Swiss newspaper also calls Akhmetov a \"generous donor\" of former President Yanukovych's previous presidential campaigns, further tying him to the Yanukovych family.\n Sonntags Zeitung reported that DTEK confirmed the search of its Geneva office.\n \"DTEK confirms that the Swiss authorities have launched an investigation into the activities of some firms owned by Ukrainian officials.  We have provided the Swiss law enforcement authorities of financial and legal documentation of our Swiss branch,\" the newspaper reported the company's press service as saying.\n DTEK also noted that its business is conducted in a fully transparent manner and complies with applicable laws of the country, and therefore is prepared to provide all necessary documents to Swiss police to aid in its investigation, the newspaper reported.\n A DTEK spokesperson told the Kyiv Post on March 17 the company was working on a response to its inquiry and would respond later in the day.\n European countries and the United States in recent weeks have slapped the Yanukovych family and other Ukrainian businesspersons and former officials with harsh sanctions, blocking access to assets and freezing several offshore accounts.\n Thus far, Akhmetov has not been included in the list of those hit with the sanctions.  But at least one Ukrainian billionaire has come under investigation by the U.S. since the change of power in Kyiv.\n Dmytro Firtash was arrested in Vienna on suspicion of organized crime and bribery based on a warrant that an American court granted to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated the Austrian Interior Ministry.\n Firtash, a chemicals and energy tycoon worth an estimated $2.3 billion, was detained without incident late on March 12 in the immediate vicinity of his business premises, Austrian News Agency reported.\n A day after he was arrested in Vienna a local court set the conditions for his bail.  To be freed, the chemicals and energy tycoon must put up \u20ac125 million, and agree to remain in Austria.\n Moreover, interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk has accused the former president and his inner circle of secretly making off with nearly $70 billion of state money, leaving Ukraine's treasury \"empty.\" \"\nChief prosecutor Oleh Makhnitsky on March 13 announced four criminal cases had been opened against the fugitive ex-President Viktor Yanukovych.\n In addition to being a suspect in mass murder, Yanukovych is being investigated for illegally acquiring public property on a large scale in unison with other individuals, and legalizing and laundering money that was acquired fraudulently.\n The other two cases are for illegally seizing power unconstitutionally in 2010 by amending the constitution through the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and for publicly calling for the seizure of state power during a press conference he gave in Rostov-on-Don, Russia on Feb. 27, where he is currently in hiding.",

El gobierno federal busca su extradici\u00f3n, agreg\u00f3 el comunicado.\n Los fiscales ofrecieron pocos detalles, pero dijeron que el caso no tiene nada que ver con la crisis en el pa\u00eds de Firtash, donde fuerzas rusas controlan desde hace d\u00edas la pen\u00ednsula de Crimea en un desaf\u00edo al gobierno proeuropeo de Kiev.\n \"El arresto de Firtash no tiene relaci\u00f3n con los acontecimientos recientes en Ucrania\", agrega el comunicado que no lo identifica como Dimitro sino como Dimitri.\n Firtash controla un conglomerado de compa\u00f1\u00edas llamado Group DF, pero los fiscales no dijeron si la acusaci\u00f3n de corrupci\u00f3n estaba vinculada con ese grupo.

                    "body": "PIA.- - En la \u00faltima semana, desde el Gobierno de Estados Unidos, el Fondo Monetario Internacional y la Uni\u00f3n Europea anunciaron millonarios \"pr\u00e9stamos\" al gobierno de Ucrania, impuesto luego de derrocar a Viktor Yanukovich.  Las inyecciones de dinero avanzan en el control econ\u00f3mico y financiero del pa\u00eds del este europeo como parte de las operaciones en la regi\u00f3n, a la par de las maniobras de injerencia pol\u00edticas y militares.\n Por un lado, el Fondo Monetario Internacional anunci\u00f3 el jueves que la \"misi\u00f3n\" desplegada en Ucrania se extender\u00e1 m\u00e1s de lo previsto.  \"La misi\u00f3n de investigaci\u00f3n del FMI trabaja en Kiev desde el 04 de marzo (...).  La Administraci\u00f3n ha pedido al equipo permanecer en Kiev y comenzar un proceso de negociaci\u00f3n (...) y tiene previsto concluir sus trabajos antes del 21 de marzo \", sostuvo la directora del organismo, Christine Lagarde.\n Por su parte, el Parlamento Europeo aprob\u00f3 otorgar 11 mil millones de euros al gobierno ucraniano, una propuesta de la Comisi\u00f3n Europea.  En la resoluci\u00f3n, se destac\u00f3 el apoyo los \"ambiciosos\" planes del nuevo Gobierno para realizar reformas pol\u00edticas, econ\u00f3micas y sociales.\n En paralelo, el Congreso de EEUU debate un proyecto para incrementar la inyecci\u00f3n de dinero en el Gobierno de Ucrania.  El mi\u00e9rcoles, el Comit\u00e9 de Exteriores del Senado aprob\u00f3 un pr\u00e9stamo de mil millones de d\u00f3lares.\n Los pr\u00e9stamos son una oportunidad para Estados Unidos y la Uni\u00f3n Europea -en articulaci\u00f3n con el FMI- para avanzar en el control de la econom\u00eda ucraniana a cambio de la aplicaci\u00f3n de sus recetas tradicionales: liberalizaci\u00f3n de la econom\u00eda y privatizaci\u00f3n de sectores econ\u00f3micos y financieros para bancas occidentales y transnacionales.  D\u00edas atr\u00e1s, las potencias del G-7 (G-8, excepto Rusia) hab\u00edan insinuado en un comunicado que el FMI ser\u00eda una de sus herramientas de operaci\u00f3n en Ucrania en connivencia con la Uni\u00f3n Europea.\n Las inyecciones de dinero son presentadas como ayuda ante la crisis econ\u00f3mica y la deuda externa de Ucrania, que \"seg\u00fan los documentos del Banco Mundial, se multiplic\u00f3 por 10 en 10 a\u00f1os y sobrepasa los 135 000 millones de d\u00f3lares.  S\u00f3lo a t\u00edtulo de intereses, Ucrania tiene que pagar alrededor de 4 500 millones de d\u00f3lares anuales\", indic\u00f3 el polit\u00f3logo Manlio Dinucci en un art\u00edculo de Il Manifesto -traducido por Voltaire-.\n El investigador italiano tambi\u00e9n sostuvo que a Estados Unidos, los pr\u00e9stamos le permitir\u00eda condicionar el aprovisionamiento de gas ruso a Europa, y expandir el mercado de compa\u00f1\u00edas estadounidenses con yacimientos en Medio Oriente y \u00c1frica.  \"Las grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas ya presentaron al Departamento de Energ\u00eda de Estados Unidos 21 pedidos para la construcci\u00f3n de instalaciones portuarias para la exportaci\u00f3n de gas licuado\", se\u00f1al\u00f3 Dinucci.\n En esa l\u00ednea, las principales sanciones propuestas contra Rusia apuntan contra las compa\u00f1\u00edas del sector energ\u00e9tico: Rusia exporta m\u00e1s del 70 por ciento del gas que consume la UE - del cual el 60 por ciento pasa por Ucrania-.\n Respecto a la Uni\u00f3n Europea, el control econ\u00f3mico fue uno de los ejes de debate en el fallido acuerdo de anexi\u00f3n con el derrocado gobierno ucraniano.  Seg\u00fan la periodista internacional Elsa Claro - en una nota publicada en Cubadebate- , el acuerdo propuesto por la UE a Ucrania inclu\u00eda \"sustituir el sistema legislativo propio por el europeo, adoptar como \u00fanica posibilidad de desarrollo el neoliberalismo y el libre comercio en su variante embudo: inundar el mercado ucraniano con producciones de sus socios occidentales, sin permitirles hacer algo similar a la inversa\".\n EEUU sobre Ucrania\nDesde EEUU, el Congreso de EEUU debate este viernes un proyecto para incrementar la inyecci\u00f3n de dinero en el Gobierno de Ucrania.  El mi\u00e9rcoles, el Comit\u00e9 de Exteriores del Senado aprob\u00f3 un pr\u00e9stamo de mil millones de d\u00f3lares a que incluye las medidas de reforma del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI).\n El republicano Rand Paul es uno de los que se muestra reticente a aprobar el proyecto, no por estar en contra del Gobierno que derroc\u00f3 a V\u00edctor Yanukovich, sino porque la ayuda econ\u00f3mica a Ucrania podr\u00eda utilizarse para financiar las compras de gas a Rusia, una medida que seg\u00fan argumenta beneficiar\u00eda de modo indirecto a Mosc\u00fa.\n El mi\u00e9rcoles, Barack Obama recibi\u00f3 al primer ministro Arsnei Yatseniuk y ratific\u00f3 su total respaldo al Gobierno interino de Kiev en la defensa de la integridad territorial y soberan\u00eda de Ucrania, seg\u00fan argument\u00f3.  En ese sentido, amenaz\u00f3 a Rusia con enfrentar los \"costos\" s\u00ed contin\u00faa con su presencia militar y apoyo al referendo en Crimea.\n Por su parte, Yatseniuk tambi\u00e9n repudi\u00f3 la actitud de Mosc\u00fa y advirti\u00f3 a Rusia que su Gobierno \"no se rendir\u00e1 jam\u00e1s\" frente a la situaci\u00f3n de Crimea y que Ucrania \"es y ser\u00e1 parte del mundo occidental\".\n En paralelo, un grupo conformado por ocho senadores estadounidenses viaj\u00f3 a Kiev para reunirse con las autoridades del Gobierno golpista.  Al mando de la comitiva est\u00e1 el senador John McCain, junto a otros tres republicanos, John Barrasso, John Hoeven, Ron Johnson y Jeff Flake, y tres dem\u00f3cratas Christopher Murphy, Richard Durbin y Sheldon Whitehouse.",
