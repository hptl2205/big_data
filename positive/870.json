(Reid Wiseman, @astro_reid)\nAfter battering Okinawa with winds over 100 mph and up to two feet of rain (preliminary estimate), Typhoon Neoguri is heading north toward the island of Kyushu in Japan.  Neoguri is a massive storm, covering an area of 64,000 square nautical miles.\n Typhoon Neoguri began to re-intensify in the overnight hours after a period of weakening on Monday.  The storm went through what is called an \"eyewall replacement cycle,\" which typically causes a decrease in cyclone strength followed by an intensification as the eyewall rebuilds.\n Although Neoguri has lost the \"super typhoon\" status, it remains a powerful storm.  It is currently just over 100 nautical miles west of Okinawa, and is still tracking north with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, and gusts up to 155 mph.\nOver 100,000 households were without power in Japan as of 6 p.m. local time, according to The Weather Channel's Nick Wiltgen:\nMinor correction: As of 6pm JST, there were 107,300 households without power in Okinawa Prefecture.  #Typhoon #Neoguri http://t.co/gsHHZfMb9K\n-- Nick Wiltgen (@WxNick) July 8, 2014\nA preliminary rainfall total of 24.03 inches since 8 a.m. Monday was recorded at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa.  While this total hasn't been confirmed yet, an incredible amount of rain is falling in the southern islands of Japan, on top of already moist and unstable ground.  This puts the area at very high risk for landslides and flooding.\n In addition to the flood risk, a peak wind gust of 118 mph was recorded in Tokashiki island, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.  Winds are still gusting hard in the storm as Neoguri passes to the west, though winds are decreasing at Kadena Air Base today, according to their recent Facebook post:\nDestructive sustained winds of 50 knots are no longer occurring.  Actual winds are 34-49 knots.  No outdoor activity is authorized other than workers from pre-designated emergency crews.\n Radar views of typhoon: Miyakojima | Okinawa | Kyushu south | Kyushu north\nThe storm is not only strong but large -- in a tweet this morning, Mashable's Andrew Freedman noted that the typhoon had a diameter that was \"similar to the distance from N.C. to Maine.\" \" The gale-force winds in the storm span an area of over 64,000 square nautical miles.  Sustained winds over 50 mph extend 100 nautical miles to the typhoon's east today, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.\n International Space Station astronaut Alexander Gerst snapped this stunning photo of Neoguri this morning, noting its enormity:\nNeoguri is expected to continue north for the next 24 hours or so, before a trough of low pressure pulls the storm to the northeast and across the mainland of Japan.  As the typhoon makes this turn it also expected to weaken due to a number of factors, including cooler water temperature, stronger upper lever wind shear, and the impact of making landfall.  While Neoguri is expected to make landfall on the island of Kyushu as a low-end typhoon (a category 1 on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale), the storm is still expected to pack a powerful punch.\n The sheer size of the typhoon (much like Hurricane Sandy in 2012) means that a large amount of ocean water is in motion, and storm surge and waves will be an impact at landfall as steady winds push water onto the shore.  Heavy rain bands and thunderstorms have been present on the eastern side of Neoguri today, as well, which means more rain for an already saturated Kyushu.\n As Dr. Jeff Masters noted in his blog yesterday, the island of Kyushu saw 10 inches of rain on Friday.  This week's additional rainfall puts the somewhat mountainous terrain at risk for landslides and flooding, especially in areas that remain in the strong thunderstorms bands.  With sustained winds around 70 mph expected upon landfall, gusts could approach and possibly exceed 90 mph, especially in the higher terrain.\n Brian McNoldy noted this fantastic microwave satellite image on his Facebook page this morning:\nMicrowave image of Typhoon Neoguri from 0900 UTC today... moving north away from the Ryukyu Islands and toward Kyushu.  One big eyewall and one enormous primary rainband show up as red in this image because of large amounts of ice in the atmosphere created in strong thunderstorms.\n And finally, here is some vivid raw video of the wind and rain whipping the trees and streets in Okinawa:",

                    "body": "Tropical Storm Neoguri, previously the strongest typhoon so far in the 2014 Western Pacific season, has made landfall on the Japanese mainland after raking Okinawa with torrential rain and hurricane-force winds.\n According to the Japanese Meteorological Agency, Neoguri's center made landfall near the city of Akune in Kagoshima Prefecture just before 7 a.m. Japanese time (6 p.m. Eastern time in the U.S.).  Akune is on the west coast of Kyushu, the southwesternmost of Japan's four main islands.\n Maximum 10-minute sustained winds were estimated at 60 mph at the time of landfall, equivalent to maximum winds of 65 to 70 mph using the U.S. 1-minute sustained wind standard.\n Neoguri has been weakening as it begins to interact with the jet stream coming off northern China and the Korean Peninsula.  These upper-level winds have also turned Neoguri sharply east into the Japanese mainland.  The center of Neoguri should continue to cross the main islands of Kyushu, Shikoku and portions of Honshu on Thursday, local time, then track off the coast of eastern Japan by Friday.\n The storm is forecast to transition to a post-tropical cyclone.  Official forecasts from JMA show little additional weakening of the maximum winds as this process takes place.\n Bands of heavy rain, some wind damage, power outages and at least some storm surge flooding on west- and south-facing shorelines of Kyushu and Shikoku are anticipated as Neoguri moves through.  Landslides are a major concern given the rugged terrain of the main islands.\n Winds on the mainland have begun to increase as the storm arrives.  A few coastal locations have reported sustained tropical-storm force winds (39 mph or greater).  Muratomisaki, a village in a part of Kochi Prefecture that juts sharply into the Pacific Ocean, reported 50-mph sustained winds and gusts to 66 mph around daybreak Thursday.\n However, such strong winds have not been widespread on the mainland.\n Rainfall has added up quickly in some locals as bands of torrential rainfall spiral northward into the country east of the advancing tropical storm.  Rainfall rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour were reported in the heaviest bands.  On Kyushu, the city of Ebino reported 13.20 inches (335.5 mm) of rain in the 24 hours ending at 8 a.m. Japanese time Thursday.\n Public broadcaster NHK said parts of central Japan, including Nagoya, could see up to 16 inches (400 mm) of rain by Friday morning.\n Heavy rains from an unrelated system have been drenching many areas of Japan in recent days.  On Wednesday, an 83-year-old man fell into a swollen river and died in Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture.  Farther west, a 12-year-old boy died in a landslide in Nagano Prefecture.  Up to 8.4 inches of rain fell in nearby Niigata Prefecture Wednesday.\n Last Thursday, According to the Japan Times, parts of Nagasaki recorded the heaviest rainfall in 50 years, with over six inches of rain falling in three hours.  Flash flooding inundated houses in the city and landslides were reported.\n (MORE: Get the Latest on Hurricane Season Here)\nElsewhere on Kyushu, JMA reported a 72-hour rainfall total of 398 mm (15.67 inches) at Ushibuka, on the island's west coast, Sunday through Wednesday evening.\n On the Japanese mainland, U.S. Navy personnel at Fleet Activities Sasebo, a naval base on the west coast of the island of Kyushu, are breathing a sigh of relief.\n Many non-essential and commercial services were closed Wednesday, according to the base's Facebook page, as the base's highest Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) was invoked.\n Captain Charles W. Rock, in a Facebook post Thursday morning, shifted the base's TCCOR into recovery mode.  \"Given the favorable conditions overnight, I suspect all is well but please wait until we are sure and call ALL CLEAR,\" he wrote.\n The JTWC forecast shows the center of Neoguri passing just south of Sasebo on Thursday morning local time (Wednesday late-afternoon U.S. time), keeping the base on the safer, weaker side of the storm's wind circulation.\n Kadena Air Base, the U.S. military installation on the island of Okinawa and the biggest U.S. air base in Asia, measured a peak wind gust to 101 mph Tuesday, with sustained winds as high as 74 mph, according to official weather observations at the base.  The base declared its highest level of alert, Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1-Emergency on Tuesday morning Japanese time (Monday evening U.S. time).\n As winds diminished below 58 mph Tuesday evening, Kadena shifted its alert status to \"TCCOR-1 Recovery,\" meaning pre-designated emergency crews were authorized to begin cleanup and recovery activities.  All other residents and personnel remained under orders to stay indoors, as winds remained in the 40-to-57-mph range.\n Kadena returned to TCCOR-4, its baseline level of typhoon preparedness throughout the summer and fall months, Wednesday evening.\n In Okinawa, heavy rainfall triggered flash flooding, prompting the Japanese Meteorological Society to reissue an \"emergency warning\" for landslides and damaging floods for the prefecture, having downgraded it earlier after the typhoon's eye had moved north.  The city of Nago on Okinawa Island reported 17.24 inches (438.0 mm) of rain between 9:10 a.m. Tuesday and 9:10 a.m. Wednesday local time.\n A Twitter user in Nago posted photos of floodwaters swamping the city of 60,000 Wednesday morning, warning residents of his or her native Miyazaki Prefecture that this was coming their way.\n \u53f0\u98a88\u53f7\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u306a\u3081\u3066\u305f\u3002 \u5bae\u5d0e\u306e\u307f\u3093\u306a\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3066\u3002 \u81ea\u5206\u3082\u9811\u5f35\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u6c34\u9053\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3060\u306b\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3002 \u6b7b\u4eba\u51fa\u308b\u305e\u307e\u3058\u3067\u3002 pic.twitter.com/3XTdav7GFL -- \u5bae\u539f\u7adc\u9a0e (@M_Ryuki0529)\nJuly 8, 2014\nThe Okinawan government raised the injury toll to 32 Wednesday, from 17 the day before.  Two of the injuries were serious.\n As the storm approached, some 540,000 people were advised to evacuate to safer shelter in Okinawa Prefecture, according to NHK.  That's about one-third of the prefecture's 1.4 million people, a population scattered across a chain of islands.\n On Okinawa, nearly 6,000 homes were still without power late Wednesday.  At its peak, Tuesday, more than 105,000 homes were without power.\n (PHOTOS: Neoguri Slams Japan)\nThe eye of Neoguri passed about 125 miles west of Kadena Air Base and the city of Naha, the prefectural capital, on Tuesday.  The left-hand (western) side of the eyewall passed over the island of Miyakojima, but the stronger right-hand (eastern) side passed over open water between Miyakojima and Kumejima.\n Television footage showed a building shattered, damaged storefronts and trees toppled as winds picked up in Naha.\n Authorities in China and Taiwan also warned ships to stay clear of the storm.  China's meteorological agency issued a \"blue typhoon warning\" for areas off its eastern coast in the East China Sea.\n (MORE: Tropical Terms You Need to Know)\nA sustained wind of 79 mph and a peak gust of 118 mph was recorded late Tuesday morning by the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) AMEDAS observation network on Tokashiki Island, part of Okinawa Prefecture, about 20 miles west of Naha.  Those are the strongest winds reported on land from the typhoon.\n The main airport on Okinawa, Naha, reopened Wednesday, although some morning flights were canceled.  Spokesman Takumi Higa said no damage has been reported.\n Airports in Kyushu were still open, but late flights were canceled, and additional cancelations may be in the works.  Japan Airlines, the nation's flagship carrier, canceled 11 flights for Wednesday mostly flights leaving Tokyo for Kyushu, said spokesman Kentaro Nakamura.\n One man is missing after his boat was overtaken by high waves from the storm off the mainland island of Kyushu, according to the Associated Press.\n JMA issued a rare emergency warning, its highest level of warning, Monday evening to the island of Miyakojima, warning of a storm surge up to about 7 feet (2 meters) and offshore waves up to 46 feet (14 meters), and asking residents to prepare for the worst.\n The agency later expanded the emergency warning to the main island of Okinawa and other nearby areas and added high winds to the emergency warning, forecasting maximum winds of 100 mph in the city of Naha.  Naha did report a peak wind gust of 112 mph Tuesday, with peak sustained winds up to 74 mph.\nJMA downgraded the emergency warning to a regular warning for ground-loosening heavy rainfall and high waves at 2:52 a.m. Japanese time Wednesday (1:52 p.m. Tuesday U.S. time), but then re-issued the emergency warning five hours later, due to flash flooding triggered by torrential rainfall.  The emergency warning was once again downgraded late Wednesday morning U.S. time.\n Neoguri was the strongest tropical cyclone of the year in the Western Pacific basin.\n The system became a typhoon - the Western Pacific equivalent of a hurricane - on Friday.  Neoguri was moving northward about 335 miles southwest of Nagasaki, Japan, as of 5 a.m. Wednesday Japanese time.\n When Neoguri's winds reached an estimated 150 mph earlier Sunday, it earned the \"super typhoon\" designation from JTWC.  That status lasted through late Monday morning U.S. time before dry air began to be pulled into the core of the system, causing it to weaken somewhat.\n JTWC's analysis clashed with that of other agencies, including JMA.  The Japanese agency estimated Neoguri's 10-minute average winds to have peaked at 95 knots, the equivalent of about 115 to 122 mph on the U.S. standard, depending on the assumptions used in converting wind speeds.\n The season's first typhoon, Faxai, reached minimal typhoon status with 75-mph winds in early March.  It did not affect land.\n An April storm named Tapah was declared a typhoon by JTWC.  However, the JMA said Tapah peaked as a \"severe tropical storm\" with winds slightly below the 74-mph threshold.\n For official purposes, the World Meteorological Organization recognizes JMA as the principal agency charged with analyzing and forecasting tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific.  In the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins, that designation is held by NOAA's National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.\n Neoguri means \"raccoon\" in Korean, according to a Sydney Morning Herald report.\n Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.",

Dangerous conditions on the coast and in the sea will be present as well as choppy water gets pushed onshore.\n Neoguri, once a super typhoon, has weakened and is no longer in its prime state.  Neoguri is now a strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 110 kph (70 mph).\n Neoguri intensified into a super typhoon early Monday morning local time (Sunday afternoon EDT).  Winds peaked at 250 kph (155 mph) before it began to weaken.\n Dry air that wrapped into the system on Monday continues to cause the storm to weaken.\n Additional information and statistics on Neoguri can be found here.\n Even though Neoguri is weakening, residents and visitors in the path of this cyclone should already be taking the necessary preparations and heed all evacuation orders.\n Dangerous conditions, in the form of torrential rain, strong winds and an increasing storm surge, are currently pounding the the far northern Ryukyu Islands and Kyushu Island as Neoguri approaches.\n Making matters worse, parts of Kyushu received more than 150 mm (6 inches) of rain on Monday as a fast-moving area of low pressure passed through the area.  This will also lead to a higher threat for flooding and mudslides.\n Landfall on Kyushu Island will occur early Thursday morning.  Neoguri will be a strong tropical storm as it presses onshore.\n The worst of the storm surge is targeting western and southern parts of Kyushu, but all coastal communities along the southern and eastern coast of mainland Japan will experience an increase in water levels and extremely rough surf.\n \"Port cities and low-lying areas will be inundated by storm surge,\" stated AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Evan Duffey.\n Heavy rain from Neoguri will bring concerns for major flooding and mudslides across parts of Kyushu, Shikoku and Honshu.\n Southern Kyushu will endure the highest rain totals with widespread amounts topping 150 mm (6 inches) and localized amounts in excess of 380 mm (15 inches).\n Flooding is also a serious concern across the island of Hokkaido and far northern Honshu, even as the storm tracks to the east.  The interaction of moisture from Neoguri and a cold front will lead to torrential rain through Friday across these areas, as well as the neighboring southern Kuril Islands.\n The strongest wind gusts, ranging between 95 and 130 kph (60 and 80 mph), will blast southern Kyushu and the far northern Ryukyu Islands.  Such winds threaten to cause widespread tree damage, power outages and some structural damage.\n Tokyo is expected to escape the worst of Neoguri but will still be soaked by some rain and buffeted by locally damaging winds Thursday night through Friday morning.  Rain totals will average 25 to 75 mm with winds gusts of 65 to 95 kph (40 to 60 mph).\n Coastal suburbs should brace for rough surf and coastal flooding.\n Although Neoguri weakened from its peak intensity, it still slammed parts of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan with winds over 160 kph (100 mph) on Tuesday.  Tokashiki reported wind gusts to near 195 kph (120 mph).\n NHK World reports that Neoguri has left one person dead and injured 38 others.\n Waves reached heights of up to 14 m (46 feet), according to the Associated Press.\n Travel in and out of the island of Okinawa was a nightmare.  However, the main airport on the island reopened Wednesday, according to the Associated Press.\n Neoguri passed only 75 to 100 miles west of Okinawa Tuesday.  Winds also gusted to 160 kph (100 mph) at Kedena Air Base while more than 150 mm (6 inches) fell at Naha.\n The Okinawan government told the Associated Press that Neoguri left trees toppled, flooded cars and bent railings on the southern island.\n At the height of the storm, more than 105,000 homes across Okinawa were without power on Tuesday.  That number is down to nearly 38,000.",

Akune is on the west coast of Kyushu, the southwesternmost of Japan's four main islands.\n Maximum 10-minute sustained winds were estimated at 60 mph at the time of landfall, equivalent to maximum winds of 65 to 70 mph using the U.S. 1-minute sustained wind standard.\n (PHOTOS: Neoguri Slams Japan)\nNeoguri continues to weaken as it interacts with the jet stream coming off northern China and the Korean Peninsula.  These upper-level winds have also turned Neoguri sharply east-northeast along the Japanese mainland.  The center of Neoguri should track off the coast of eastern Japan by Friday morning, transitioning to a post-tropical cyclone.\n Pockets of heavy rain and some minor wind damage (tree limbs, sporadic power outages) are possible before the low moves offshore.  Landslides are a major concern given the rugged terrain of the main islands.\n A few coastal locations have reported sustained tropical-storm force winds (39 mph or greater).  Muratomisaki, a village in a part of Kochi Prefecture that juts sharply into the Pacific Ocean, reported 50-mph sustained winds and gusts to 66 mph around daybreak Thursday.  Seto, roughly halfway between Osaka and Tokyo, reported sustained winds of 60 mph with a gust to 77 mph early Thursday.\n Rainfall has added up quickly in some locals as bands of torrential rainfall spiral northward into the country east of the advancing tropical storm.  Rainfall rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour were reported in the heaviest bands.  On Kyushu, the city of Ebino reported 13.29 inches (337.5 mm) of rain in the 24 hours ending at 9:50 a.m. Japanese time Thursday.\n Heavy rains from an unrelated system have been drenching many areas of Japan in recent days.  On Wednesday, an 83-year-old man fell into a swollen river and died in Koriyama, Fukushima Prefecture.  Farther west, a 12-year-old boy died in a landslide in Nagano Prefecture.  Up to 8.4 inches of rain fell in nearby Niigata Prefecture Wednesday.\n Last Thursday, According to the Japan Times, parts of Nagasaki recorded the heaviest rainfall in 50 years, with over six inches of rain falling in three hours.  Flash flooding inundated houses in the city and landslides were reported.\n (MORE: Get the Latest on Hurricane Season Here)\nElsewhere on Kyushu, JMA reported a 72-hour rainfall total of 398 mm (15.67 inches) at Ushibuka, on the island's west coast, Sunday through Wednesday evening.\n On the Japanese mainland, U.S. Navy personnel at Fleet Activities Sasebo, a naval base on the west coast of the island of Kyushu, are breathing a sigh of relief.\n Many non-essential and commercial services were closed Wednesday, according to the base's Facebook page, as the base's highest Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) was invoked.\n Captain Charles W. Rock, in a Facebook post Thursday morning, shifted the base's TCCOR into recovery mode.  \"Given the favorable conditions overnight, I suspect all is well but please wait until we are sure and call ALL CLEAR,\" he wrote.\n (MORE: Tropical Terms You Need to Know)\nThe JTWC forecast shows the center of Neoguri passing just south of Sasebo on Thursday morning local time (Wednesday late-afternoon U.S. time), keeping the base on the safer, weaker side of the storm's wind circulation.\n Kadena Air Base, the U.S. military installation on the island of Okinawa and the biggest U.S. air base in Asia, measured a peak wind gust to 101 mph Tuesday, with sustained winds as high as 74 mph, according to official weather observations at the base.  The base declared its highest level of alert, Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1-Emergency on Tuesday morning Japanese time (Monday evening U.S. time).\n As winds diminished below 58 mph Tuesday evening, Kadena shifted its alert status to \"TCCOR-1 Recovery,\" meaning pre-designated emergency crews were authorized to begin cleanup and recovery activities.  All other residents and personnel remained under orders to stay indoors, as winds remained in the 40-to-57-mph range.\n Kadena returned to TCCOR-4, its baseline level of typhoon preparedness throughout the summer and fall months, Wednesday evening.\n In Okinawa, heavy rainfall triggered flash flooding, prompting the Japanese Meteorological Society to reissue an \"emergency warning\" for landslides and damaging floods for the prefecture, having downgraded it earlier after the typhoon's eye had moved north.  The city of Nago on Okinawa Island reported 18.01 inches (457.5 mm) of rain between 7:40 p.m. Tuesday and 7:40 p.m. Thursday local time.\n A Twitter user in Nago posted photos of floodwaters swamping the city of 60,000 Wednesday morning, warning residents of his or her native Miyazaki Prefecture that this was coming their way.\n \u53f0\u98a88\u53f7\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u306a\u3081\u3066\u305f\u3002 \u5bae\u5d0e\u306e\u307f\u3093\u306a\u3001\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u3066\u3002 \u81ea\u5206\u3082\u9811\u5f35\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 \u6c34\u9053\u96fb\u6c17\u304c\u3044\u307e\u3060\u306b\u30b9\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u3002 \u6b7b\u4eba\u51fa\u308b\u305e\u307e\u3058\u3067\u3002 pic.twitter.com/3XTdav7GFL -- \u5bae\u539f\u7adc\u9a0e (@M_Ryuki0529)\nJuly 8, 2014\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK reported more than 500 homes were flooded and nearly 50 people have been injured.\n As the storm approached, some 540,000 people were advised to evacuate to safer shelter in Okinawa Prefecture, according to NHK.  That's about one-third of the prefecture's 1.4 million people, a population scattered across a chain of islands.\n On Okinawa, nearly 6,000 homes were still without power late Wednesday.  At its peak Tuesday, more than 105,000 homes were without power.\n The eye of Neoguri passed about 125 miles west of Kadena Air Base and the city of Naha, the prefectural capital, on Tuesday.  The left-hand (western) side of the eyewall passed over the island of Miyakojima, but the stronger right-hand (eastern) side passed over open water between Miyakojima and Kumejima.\n Television footage showed a building shattered, damaged storefronts and trees toppled as winds picked up in Naha.\n Authorities in China and Taiwan also warned ships to stay clear of the storm.  China's meteorological agency issued a \"blue typhoon warning\" for areas off its eastern coast in the East China Sea.\n A sustained wind of 79 mph and a peak gust of 118 mph was recorded late Tuesday morning by the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) AMEDAS observation network on Tokashiki Island, part of Okinawa Prefecture, about 20 miles west of Naha.  Those are the strongest winds reported on land from the typhoon.\n The main airport on Okinawa, Naha, reopened Wednesday, although some morning flights were canceled.  Spokesman Takumi Higa said no damage has been reported.\n Airports in Kyushu were still open, but late flights were canceled, and additional cancelations may be in the works.  Japan Airlines, the nation's flagship carrier, canceled 11 flights for Wednesday mostly flights leaving Tokyo for Kyushu, said spokesman Kentaro Nakamura.\n One man is missing after his boat was overtaken by high waves from the storm off the mainland island of Kyushu, according to the Associated Press.\n JMA issued a rare emergency warning, its highest level of warning, Monday evening to the island of Miyakojima, warning of a storm surge up to about 7 feet (2 meters) and offshore waves up to 46 feet (14 meters), and asking residents to prepare for the worst.\n The agency later expanded the emergency warning to the main island of Okinawa and other nearby areas and added high winds to the emergency warning, forecasting maximum winds of 100 mph in the city of Naha.  Naha did report a peak wind gust of 112 mph Tuesday, with peak sustained winds up to 74 mph.\nJMA downgraded the emergency warning to a regular warning for ground-loosening heavy rainfall and high waves at 2:52 a.m. Japanese time Wednesday (1:52 p.m. Tuesday U.S. time), but then re-issued the emergency warning five hours later, due to flash flooding triggered by torrential rainfall.  The emergency warning was once again downgraded late Wednesday morning U.S. time.\n Neoguri was the strongest tropical cyclone of the year in the Western Pacific basin.\n The system became a typhoon - the Western Pacific equivalent of a hurricane - on Friday.  Neoguri was moving northward about 335 miles southwest of Nagasaki, Japan, as of 5 a.m. Wednesday Japanese time.\n When Neoguri's winds reached an estimated 150 mph earlier Sunday, it earned the \"super typhoon\" designation from JTWC.  That status lasted through late Monday morning U.S. time before dry air began to be pulled into the core of the system, causing it to weaken somewhat.\n JTWC's analysis clashed with that of other agencies, including JMA.  The Japanese agency estimated Neoguri's 10-minute average winds to have peaked at 95 knots, the equivalent of about 115 to 122 mph on the U.S. standard, depending on the assumptions used in converting wind speeds.\n The season's first typhoon, Faxai, reached minimal typhoon status with 75-mph winds in early March.  It did not affect land.\n An April storm named Tapah was declared a typhoon by JTWC.  However, the JMA said Tapah peaked as a \"severe tropical storm\" with winds slightly below the 74-mph threshold.\n For official purposes, the World Meteorological Organization recognizes JMA as the principal agency charged with analyzing and forecasting tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific.  In the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins, that designation is held by NOAA's National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.\n Neoguri means \"raccoon\" in Korean, according to a Sydney Morning Herald report.\n Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.",

                    "body": "TOKYO - Torrential rains from a weakened but still dangerous typhoon battered Japan's Okinawa islands on Wednesday, leaving two dead and threatening widespread flooding as the storm headed for the nation's main islands.\n Typhoon Neoguri, a super typhoon as it bore down on Okinawa this week, had winds gusting up to 162 kph (100 mph) on Wednesday, but weather forecasters said the major concern now was rain, especially as parts of the westernmost main island of Kyushu have already been hit by heavy rain over the last week.\n Authorities warned of record rainfall in Okinawa as rivers in some areas overflowed.  More than 200,000 residents were told to leave their homes, down from over 500,000 on Tuesday.\n \"Given the situation, there is still potential for some serious damage,\" an official from the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) told a news conference.\n Some 30 people were injured, mainly from falls, but none of the injuries was life-threatening.  Television footage showed a collapsed building and flooded streets in Okinawa.\n Neoguri was moving north across the East China Sea at 20 kph as of 9 a.m. (0000 GMT), with sustained winds of 126 kph.  It was expected to draw near Kyushu on Thursday morning before moving east along the main island of Honshu.\n \"This typhoon has very active rain clouds and this will continue as it moves east over areas that have already been hit by downpours as part of the rainy seasion,\" said a JMA official.\n \"Given how soaked the ground is in some parts of Kyushu already, there is a high danger of landslides and floods, even though the typhoon's strength is diminishing.\" \"\nThere are two nuclear plants on Kyushu and another on nearby Shikoku island.\n All of Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are shut down three years after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was wrecked by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  The stricken plant is on the other side of the country.\n Nansei Sekiyu KK, a Japanese refiner wholly owned by Brazil's Petrobras, suspended operations at its 100,000 barrels-per-day Nishihara refinery in Okinawa on Monday evening and still had not resumed them on Wednesday.\n Tokyo may see heavy rains on Friday but the impact on the capital is otherwise expected to be minimal, the JMA official said.  Around two to four typhoons make landfall in Japan each year but they are unusual in July.",

                    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Typhoon Neoguri headed toward Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu, prompting the evacuation of almost 90,000 people amid the threat of floods and landslides.\n Neoguri was west of Kyushu with top winds reaching 148 kilometers (92 miles) per hour, down from yesterday's 252 kph, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.  The storm, which was heading east as of 7:50 pm local time, left 20 injured in Okinawa yesterday, where it grounded flights and prompted evacuations.\n Parts of Kyushu will probably be hit by tomorrow with violent winds, swollen rivers and waves up to 10 meters high, the weather agency reported on its website.  While rain brought by the storm will generally amount to 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) to 3 inches, some areas may get as much as 5 inches, leading to \"localized flooding in higher terrain,\" says Commodity Weather Group LLC.\n \"The storm is weakening just slightly faster and should be down to tropical storm force winds, 55 knots (102 kph), at landfall in southwestern Japan in about 12 hours,\" David Streit, a forecaster at CWG in Bethesda, Maryland, said in an e-mail received at 6:23 p.m. Tokyo time.  \"Winds will be down to 35 knots when it passes Tokyo about 24 hours later.\" \"\nOfficials in the Kyushu city of Amakusa urged 87,327 residents today to take shelter in gyms and other buildings being used as evacuation centers, as the storm threatened homes, public broadcaster NHK reported on its website.\n Companies with Kyushu factories, including Nissan Motor Co. and Toshiba Corp., were watching the storm's approach.\n Storm Countermeasures\n\"We instructed factories and offices in Japan to take measures for safety against the approaching typhoon,\" said Yu Takase, a spokeswoman for Toshiba, which has a chip factory in Kyushu's Oita prefecture.  \"Right now, our factories are operating as usual.\" \"\nNissan and Toyota Motor Corp. were monitoring the storm and planned to decide on any countermeasures to be taken tomorrow by this evening, the companies said.\n Toyota and Nissan built 1.32 million vehicles at their four plants in Kyushu last year, Satomi Hamada, a production analyst for IHS Automotive, wrote in an e-mail.\n Nissan's two plants on the island accounted for 65% of the company's domestic production last year, while Toyota's portion was 18%.\n The storm's was expected to pivot east as Neoguri interacts with a low-pressure system over Manchuria, said Jim Andrews, a meteorologist with AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania.  The low has created a vigorous westerly jet stream that will push the storm into Kyushu.\n \"The storm is clearly weakening,\" he said.  \"We're thinking more a minimal typhoon or a strong tropicalstorm as it crosses the southwest coast of Kyushu.\" \"\nBoat Capsizes\nJapan Airlines Co. and its affiliates grounded 11 flights to and from southern Japan today as of 4 p.m., the company said in an e-mailed statement.  The All Nippon Airways Co. group canceled 29 flights, affecting 2,000 passengers.\n One serious injury in Okinawa was attributed to the storm, while 19 other people suffered slight injuries, according to a statement from Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency, which gave no other details.\n The Mainichi newspaper reported that a man died yesterday after the fishing boat he was aboard capsized off the island of Shikoku farther northeast from the storm's center, where the weather agency has a high-wave advisory in effect.\n In the Okinawan city of Miyako, residents who had been urged to take shelter from the storm in community centers and municipal buildings returned to their homes after an evacuation alert was lifted yesterday at 6:30 p.m., disaster prevention spokesman Satoshi Shimoji said.\n Service Blackouts\nNansei Sekiyu KK, a unit of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA, halted refining and shipping operations yesterday at its 100,000 barrel-a-day Nishihara plant in Okinawa, the company said in an e-mailed statement.\n Marine operations at JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.'s 270,000-barrel-a-day Negishi refinery near Tokyo remained suspended today because of high waves caused by the storm's approach, according to a company official who asked not to be identified because of internal policy.\n Customers of NTT Docomo Inc., Japan's largest wireless carrier, continued to experience service blackouts in some remote parts of Okinawa, according to a map on the company's website.\n Neoguri, which means raccoon in Korean, had sustained winds of 102 kilometers per hour.  The Japanese Meteorological Agency has dropped emergency warnings for the area while maintaining alerts for high winds, thunderstorms, heavy rain, strong winds and possible landslides in parts of Kyushu.\n \"Heavy rains causing major flooding will be the main concern, due to saturated soils on Kyushu caused by very heavy rains since Thursday from a stalled front,\" said Jeff Masters, co-founder of Weather Underground in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n Storm Season\nJapan has averaged more than 11 typhoons per year over a 30-year period ending in 2010, most of them occurring between July and October, according to the weather agency's website.\n \"The strength of the typhoon is a once-in-several-decades event,\" Akihiro Ohta, Japan's transport minister, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday.  \"We urge people to pay attention to warnings from their local governments.\" \"\nAndrews said the remnants of Neoguri may hug Japan's east coast.  He said Tokyo itself will probably be spared the worst because it is sheltered by mountains to the south.",

More than 200 000 residents were told to leave their homes, down from over 500 000 on Tuesday.\n \"Given the situation, there is still potential for some serious damage,\" an official from the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) told a news conference.\n About 30 people were injured, mainly from falls, but none of the injuries was life-threatening.  Television footage showed a collapsed building and flooded streets in Okinawa.\n Neoguri was moving north across the East China Sea at 20kph as of 9am (00.00 GMT), with sustained winds of 126kph.  It was expected to draw near Kyushu on Thursday morning before moving east along the main island of Honshu.\n \"This typhoon has very active rain clouds and this will continue as it moves east over areas that have already been hit by downpours as part of the rainy season,\" said a JMA official.\n \"Given how soaked the ground is in some parts of Kyushu already, there is a high danger of landslides and floods, even though the typhoon's strength is diminishing.\" \"\nThere are two nuclear plants on Kyushu and another on nearby Shikoku island.\n All of Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are shut down three years after the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was wrecked by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.  The stricken plant is on the other side of the country.\n Nansei Sekiyu KK, a Japanese refiner wholly owned by Brazil's Petrobras, suspended operations at its 100 000 barrels-per-day Nishihara refinery in Okinawa on Monday evening and still had not resumed them on Wednesday.\n Tokyo may see heavy rains on Friday but the impact on the capital is otherwise expected to be minimal, the JMA official said.  Around two to four typhoons make landfall in Japan each year but they are unusual in July.  - Reuters",

It has weakened to just a shadow of its former self, with maximum sustained winds of just 70 miles per hour as of 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday.\n While the storm's winds will continue to weaken as the storm moves over land and encounters strong jet stream winds aloft that are helping to tear the storm apart, Neoguri remains a major hazard.\n The storm's biggest threat lies in its capacity to produce heavy rainfall that can lead to flooding and mudslides.  This is especially the case in southwestern Japan, where record rainfall that was unrelated to Neoguri has primed the ground for landslides.  At least one landslide has already been reported in Nagano, which killed a 12-year-old boy, according to The Weather Channel.\n A more clear photo of the landslide in Nagano.  pic.t twitter.c com/pTNxtayqFo\n-- Robert Speta (@robertspeta) July 9, 2014\nCiting the Japanese Meteorological Agency, The Weather Channel also reported that 15.67 inches of rain fell at Ushibuka, on Kyushu's west coast, Sunday through Wednesday evening.  Those rains were also unrelated to the approaching typhoon.\n Japan's NHK news agency is reporting that up to 28 inches of rain could fall in the higher elevations of Kyushu as the storm makes landfall and proceeds northeastward, passing near or over the islands of Kyushu, Shikoku and portions of Honshu, including the city of Tokyo, before reemerging over the Pacific Ocean.\n The storm's slow movement of just 10 to 15 miles per hour heightens the threat of flooding.\n Okinawa offers a preview of what may be to come for Japan's more populated main islands.  After being battered by winds gusting to 101 miles per hour, at least 17 inches of rain fell in about 24 hours in Nago, Okinawa, causing widespread flash flooding.

Neoguri weakened over the past 12-24 hours and has now been downgraded to a moderate typhoon.  \"Neoguri has encountered some drier air from the north, AIR continued; \"equator ward outflow has decreased, and sea surface temperatures are not quite as warm as yesterday (but still warm enough to sustain a tropical cyclone).  Neoguri is projected to hit Kyushu Island early morning Thursday, July 10, local time.\" \"\nAccording to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), as of the July 8, 1500 UTC advisory, Typhoon Neoguri is located approximately 300 km [186.5 miles] northwest of Okinawa's capital, Naha.  The storm has a minimum central pressure estimated at 945 mb and maximum 10-minute sustained wind speeds estimated at 155 km/h [96 mph], with gusts as high as 225 km/h [140 mph].  Neoguri still exhibits a well-defined, nearly symmetrical eye.\n \"Neoguri is forecast to slowly weaken over the next 24 hours as it encounters lower sea surface temperatures, higher vertical wind shear, and begins interacting with an approaching trough from the northwest,\" said Jason Butke, principal scientist at AIR Worldwide.  \"Neoguri made its turn to the north yesterday and will continue on this northerly track before recurving more to the north-northeast and then turning to the northeast.\n \"In 36 hours, Neoguri is forecast to make landfall in southwestern Kyushu Island near the city of Kagoshima as a strong Category 1 or weak Category 2 typhoon.  However, because of the orientation of Japan's coastline, even slight changes in the forecast track may have significant implications for loss potential.\n \"After that, Neoguri will weaken further as it encounters the rough terrain of Kyushu Island and will accelerate to the east-northeast as it continues its interaction with the trough and the mid-latitude westerlies.  Neoguri is expected to undergo extratropical transitioning.\" \"\nIn advance of the storm's arrival, more than 500,000 people were evacuated from Okinawa.  According to the Okinawa Electric Power Company, more than 100,000 customers have lost power.\n \"Nansei Sekiyu KK, a Japanese oil refiner, reported that it had suspended operations in Okinawa.  In Naha, trees have been uprooted, storefronts damaged, and lampposts blown over.  Effects from the storm's outer rain bands in Okinawa have caused Japanese officials to cancel flights there, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.  In addition, all ferries connecting islands within the prefecture have been grounded.  The storm has resulted in one fatality.\n Evacuation orders have also been put in place for thousands of people along the southern coastline of Kyushu because of the threat of storm surge.\n The JMA issued an emergency typhoon warning for Okinawa and the Miyako Islands -- the first time such a high-level warning has been issued since the alert system was introduced last August.\n Butke explained: \"Neoguri has an expansive wind field.  The highest 10-minute sustained wind speeds were observed on the right side of Neoguri over Okinawa and the islands directly to the west.  Naha recorded a peak sustained wind speed of 103 km/h [64 mph] with a peak gust of 181 km/h [112.5 mph].  Kumejima Airport reported a peak sustained wind speed of 123 km/h [76.5 mph] with a gust of 166 km/h [103 mph] while Tokashiki, at an elevation of 220 meters [722 feet], experienced the strongest recorded sustained and gust wind speeds of 122 km/h [76 mph] and 191 km/h [118.7 mph], respectively.\" \"\nAccording to AIR, the vulnerability of buildings to flood damage varies by construction type.  For a given flood depth, a residential wood-frame building is expected to sustain more damage than a residential masonry building.\n Butke concluded, \"Over the previous two to three days, large parts of western Kyushu have experienced heavy precipitation.  Many regions are saturated and therefore any additional precipitation from Neoguri will exacerbate the flood potential in this region.\" \"\nIn addition AIR explained that \"flood insurance does not exist as a standalone policy in Japan.  Instead, property owners can opt to purchase flood coverage as part of a standard fire insurance policy.  In typical Japanese flood policy coverage, a specified payout is made only when actual damage falls within a specified range of loss.\" \"",

The storm also boosted rainfall levels in other parts of the country, leaving two people dead.\n One of the biggest storms ever to hit Japan during the summer, tropical storm Neoguri reached the southernmost main island of Kyushu on Thursday morning, and was forecast to travel up the Pacific coast of Japan to major cities including Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo.\n Kyushu's Fukuoka prefecture issued warnings for strong winds, high tides and heavy rains, and advised people to stay indoors as much as possible.\n Neoguri, which hit Okinawa on Tuesday at typhoon strength, was downgraded to a tropical storm Wednesday after losing strength.  It toppled trees and flooded cars in Okinawa, which experienced its heaviest rainfall in a half century, according to the Okinawan government.\n In central Japan, rainfall elevated by the storm caused floods and landslides, killing two people.  In Fukushima, an 83-year-old man fell into a swollen river and died, while a landslide hit a town in Nagano prefecture, killing a 12-year-old boy, according to Japanese media reports.\n The torrents of rainfall could trigger more landslides and floods, and much of eastern Japan was at risk of lightning and tornadoes.\n On Okinawa, more than 105,000 homes lost power at the storm's peak.  The Okinawan government raised the injury toll to 32 on Wednesday, say two were in serious condition.\n Neoguri, which means \"raccoon dog\" in Korean, was packing sustained winds of 93 kilometers (58 miles) per hour on Thursday morning, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.\n Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report.\n Follow Yuri Kageyama at twitter.c com/yurikageyama; Mari Yamaguchi at twitter.c com/mariyamaguchi",

Separately, a man has already been reported missing from a fishing boat in rough seas off Kyushu to the north.\n Typhoon Neoguri, one of the biggest storms to hit during Japan's summer, appeared to be headed toward Kyushu, where it could land Thursday.  Then it could travel across the main island of Honshu.\n Neoguri, which means \"raccoon dog\" in Korean, was moving northward at 25 kilometers an hour (15 miles an hour) packing sustained winds of 126 kilometers an hour (78 miles an hours) by midday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.\n Kyushu's Fukuoka Prefecture issued warnings for strong winds, high tides and heavy rains, and advised people to stay indoors as much as possible.\n On Okinawa, evacuation orders were issued to 125,000 households, or nearly 300,000 people, according to the prefectural government.\n The main airport on Okinawa, Naha, was closed Tuesday but reopened Wednesday, although some morning flights were canceled.\n \"Rain has finally stopped, but there is still some wind, and we are checking into any damages at the airport,\" said spokesman Takumi Higa, while adding that there were no reports of any damage so far.\n Airports in Kyushu were still open, but late flights were canceled, and additional cancellations may be in the works.\n Japan Airlines, the nation's flagship carrier, cancelled 11 flights for Wednesday mostly flights leaving Tokyo for Kyushu, said spokesman Kentaro Nakamura.\n Authorities in China and Taiwan have also warned ships to stay clear of the storm.\n The torrents of rainfall set off by Neoguri could trigger landslides and floods.  Heavy rainfall was expected to hit much of eastern Japan, setting off risks of lightning and tornadoes.\n Neoguri left toppled trees, flooded cars and bent railings in its path, according to the Okinawan government, in what it said was the heaviest rainfall experienced there in a half century.\n ___\nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.c com/yurikageyama\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Local carrier Japan Air Commuter Co., which serves a number of Japan's remote islands, canceled 86 flights.\n Shinkansen bullet train lines were disrupted between Hakata Station in Fukuoka and Kagoshima-Chuo Station in the city of Kagoshima and Fukushima and Yamagata stations in Japan's northeast, the respective operators reported.

While rain will generally amount to 2.5 centimetres to 7.5 centimetres, some areas may get as much as 12.5 centimetres, leading to \"localised flooding in higher terrain,\" said Commodity Weather Group LLC.\n \"Winds will be down to 35 knots when it passes Tokyo about 24 hours later,\" David Streit, a forecaster at Commodity Weather in Bethesda, Maryland, said in an email received at 6.23 pm Tokyo time.\n Widespread damage ...

The low has created a vigorous westerly jet stream that will push the storm into Kyushu.'

He said Tokyo itself will probably be spared the worst because it is sheltered by mountains to the south.\n Japan Airlines and its affiliates grounded 11 flights to and from southern Japan earlier, the company said in an emailed statement.  The All Nippon Airways group canceled 29 flights, affecting 2000 passengers.\n Refinery halted\nNansei Sekiyu KK, a unit of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA, halted refining and shipping operations at its 100,000 barrel-a-day Nishihara plant in Okinawa, the company said in an e-mailed statement.\n Marine operations at JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp.'s 270,000-barrel-a-day Negishi refinery near Tokyo remained suspended because of high waves caused by the storm's approach, according to a company official who asked not to be identified because of internal policy.\n One serious injury in Okinawa was attributed to the storm, while 19 people suffered slight injuries, according to a statement from Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency, which gave no other details.\n The Mainichi newspaper reported that a man died yesterday after the fishing boat he was aboard capsized off the island of Shikoku farther northeast from the storm's centre, where the weather agency has a high-wave advisory in effect.\n Japan has averaged more than 11 typhoons per year over a 30-year period ending in 2010, most of them occurring between July and October, according to the weather agency's website.\n Bloomberg",

The three satellites gathered data on rainfall, cloud heights, cloud extent, cloud temperatures, the size of the eye, and what was happening in the eye.\n Typhoon Neoguri formed in the western Pacific Ocean south-southeast of Guam on July 3, 2014.  Since then Neoguri has become increasingly more powerful and dangerous.  The word Neoguri means \"raccoon\" in Korean.  On July 5 at 0426 UTC (12:26 a.m. EDT) NASA's CloudSat satellite passed over Typhoon Neoguri when its maximum sustained winds were near 110 knots (127 mph).\n CloudSat passed over the western edge of the center of the storm revealing a portion of eye and eye wall structure.  CloudSat found that a canopy or covering of high, wispy cirrus clouds covered the eye, and that there was a small area of cumulus and stratocumulus clouds near the surface.\n NASA's TRMM Satellite Sees Heavy Rainfall in Typhoon Neoguri On July 7 at 2:41 a.m. EDT the TRMM satellite had a near perfect view as it passed above the center of Typhoon Neoguri.  Heaviest rainfall was occurring at over 106 mm (4.2) inches per hour in feeder bands southeast of Neoguri's eye.\n When CloudSat passed overhead, Typhoon Neoguri had a notably large eye with meso vorticies (small scale rotational areas usually found in an intensifying tropical cyclone as was the case with Neoguri) in the inner eye.  CloudSat passed over Neoguri from northwest to southeast and cut through the center of the storm.  CloudSat found a wide area of moderate to heavy rainfall and convection (rising air that forms thunderstorms) south of the eyewall and outer bands.  CloudSat also provided a side view of the extent of Neoguri's clouds, and found the cirrus canopy extends hundreds of miles/kilometers outward from the center.\n On July 7 at 0641 UTC (2:41 a.m. EDT) NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission or TRMM satellite had a near perfect view as it passed above the center of Typhoon Neoguri.  At that time, Neoguri was classified as a category four typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale with sustained winds estimates at 135 knots (155 mph).\n Rainfall from TRMM's Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) revealed that Neoguri's nearly circular eye wall contained intense thunderstorms.  TRMM PR found that the heaviest precipitation was occurring at a rate of over 106 mm (about 4.2) inches per hour in feeder bands southeast of Neoguri's eye.\n At NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, TRMM's Precipitation Radar data was used to create a 3-D simulated view that showed Neoguri's circular eye wall was unbroken and contained storms that were uniformly reaching heights of 13 to 15 km (8 to 9.3 miles).\n On July 8 at 0500 UTC (1 a.m. EDT), NASA's Aqua satellite passed over Typhoon Neoguri when it was in the East China Sea.  The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or MODIS instrument captured a visible image of the storm that shows some cirrus clouds in a mostly clear eye.  Neoguri's center was due west of Kume Island.  Kume Island is a populated volcanic island that is part of the Okinawa Islands and the Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.\n As Aqua passed over Neoguri, another instrument aboard captured infrared data on the storm's clouds and temperatures.  The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder or AIRS instrument found cold cloud tops in powerful thunderstorms around the eyewall (wall of thunderstorms around the storm's open center) were as cold as -70C to -80C (-94F to -112F) degrees.  AIRS showed an eye that was about 25 nautical-miles (28.7 miles/46.3 km) wide.\n On July 8 at 1500 UTC (11 a.m. EDT) Neoguri's maximum sustained winds had dropped to 105 knots.  It was centered near 28.3 north latitude and 125.8 east longitude, about 379 nautical miles (436 miles/702 miles) southwest of Sasebo, Japan.  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center or JTWC noted that Neoguri was moving to the north at 13 knots (14.9 mph/24.0 kph), but forecasts a change to the northeast.  Neoguri is creating large and dangerous swells with wave heights to 37 feet (11.2 meters).\n The JTWC predicts Typhoon Neoguri will turn to the east and make landfall in southern Kyushu slightly after 0000 UTC on July 10 (8 p.m. EDT on July 9).",

                    "body": "From July 4 to July 7 Tropical Cyclone Neoguri strengthened from a tropical storm into a supertyphoon.  NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites passed over the rapidly intensifying storm and provided forecasters with visible, infrared and microwave data on the powerful supertyphoon.\n On July 4 at 0900 UTC (5 a.m. EDT) Neoguri had maximum sustained winds near 55 knots (63.2 mph/101.9 kph).  It was located near 13.1 north and 141.4 east, about 207 nautical miles (238.2 miles/383.4 km) west of Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.  It was moving to the northwest at 13 knots (14.9 mph/24.0 kph).  This visible image from the MODIS instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite at 03:40 UTC on July 4 showed the bulk of the clouds and showers south and east of a clear eye.\n NASA's Terra satellite passed over Neoguri as it became a typhoon on July 5.  At 01:20 UTC (July 4 at 9:20 p.m. EDT) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer known as MODIS that flies aboard Terra captured a visible image of Neoguri as it moved through the Northwestern Pacific Ocean.  The MODIS image showed a clear eye, and a large, thick band of thunderstorms in the southern quadrant of the storm wrapping into the center.\n On July 5 at 0900 UTC (5 a.m. EDT) satellite data helped confirm that Neoguri had become a typhoon in the Northwestern Pacific after it passed Guam.  At that time it was centered near 16.0 north and 137.0 east, about 813 nautical miles (935.6 miles/1,506 km) southeast of Kadena Air Base.  It was moving west-northwest at 14 knots (16.1 mph/25.9 kph) and had maximum sustained winds near 115 knots (132.3 mph/213.0 kph).\n On July 6 Typhoon Neoguri continued to strengthen.  Neoguri was located near 18.5 north and 131.4 east at 0900 UTC (5 a.m. EDT) on July 6.  That's about 661 nautical miles (760.7 miles/1,224 km) southeast of Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan.  It had maximum sustained winds near 120 knots (138.1 mph/222.2 kph) and was moving to the west-northwest at 15 knots (17.2 mph/27.7 kph).  The Joint Typhoon Warning Center or JTWC noted that Neoguri was generating very rough and high seas as high as 32 feet (9.7 meters).\n A false-colored infrared image of Supertyphoon Neoguri on July 6 at 17:17 UTC (1:17 p.m. EDT) was made at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California using data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument.  AIRS flies aboard NASA's Aqua satellite.  The infrared imagery showed very cold, high, powerful thunderstorms around the center of Neoguri's 40-nautical-mile-wide-eye and in a thick band south of the center.\n By July 7 at 1500 UTC (11 a.m. EDT), Neoguri had grown into a supertyphoon with maximum sustained winds near 130 knots (149.6 mph/240.8 kph).  The JTWC expects Neoguri to strengthen further.  Neoguri was located near 21.6 north latitude and 127.3 east longitude, about 246 nautical miles (283.1 miles/455.6 km) south-southwest of Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan.  It was moving to the northwest at 15 knots (17.2 mph/27.7 kph).  As Neoguri strengthened, the ocean has become more turbulent, and JTWC estimates maximum significant wave heights near 40 feet (12.1 meters).\n Tropical storm-force winds extend 210 nautical miles (241.7 miles/388.9 km) from the center, and hurricane-force winds extend up to 60 nautical miles (69.0 miles/111.1 km) from the center.\n For a graphic of watches in warnings in effect in Japan, visit the Japan Meteorological Agency's page: http://www.jma.go.jp/en/warn/.\n Neoguri is moving northwest and continuing to strengthen.  The JTWC expects Neoguri to turn to the north late on July 7 (EDT) and pass Kadena Air Base.  A landfall in Kyushu is expected by July 9.  The JTWC noted in a July 7 discussion: by July 9, cooling sea surface temperatures, increasing vertical wind shear ahead of the mid-latitude westerlies (winds), and landfall into Kyushu, Japan, will slowly erode the system.",

This will likely cause flooding and landslides across the country.\n This tropical cyclone is bringing large quantities of rain because of its massive size and how slowly it's moving.\n Since this typhoon is so large, it will have an affect on weather halfway around the world in the United States.\n The jet stream is the main steering mechanism for weather in the northern hemisphere all around the world.  Sometimes it travels in a straight, west to east pattern called zonal flow and at other times, it buckles, moving north and south while it travels west to east, called meridional flow.\n Typhoons like Neoguri are large enough that they're able to change how the jet stream travels.\n In this case, it's going to push the jet stream much farther north than it normally does, creating a ridge.  On the other side of this ridge, the jet stream will dive farther south than it normally does, creating a trough.\n It just so happens this ridge and this trough will split the United States in two next week.\n The western half of the United States will be under the influence of a large ridge, allowing warm air to build, so temperatures will be well above normal there.  The eastern half of the country will be within the trough and north of the jet stream, so much cooler air will begin to pour into the Central Plains, Midwest, Mid-South, and Northeast.\n This means the West could experience some of their hottest temperatures yet while the eastern half of the country starts to feel more like late spring or early summer.\n This won't last forever though.  As typhoon Neoguri weakens and dissipates, the jet stream will return to a more normal state, and temperatures won't be unseasonably hot or cold - until the next big storm changes things up.",
