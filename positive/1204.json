Photo: Philippe Desmazes\n\nFIFA Congress with Sepp Blatter gives off florid stench of corruption FIFA arrests: Darkest day? No, brightest hour Shocking news of 'slave' deaths in Qatar no surprise\n\nFIFA, the notoriously corrupt and yet seemingly invincible governing body of world football, has finally landed itself an indictment that some would say is worthy of its reputation.\n\nThe charges against a handful of senior FIFA officials include money laundering, racketeering, bribery and fraud. In short, the federal lawsuit alleges what millions of soccer fans have suspected all along: that FIFA officials have been using the organisation's massive influence to line their pocketbooks.\n\nAl-Khor Stadium in Al-Khor. To be built. Expected capacity 45,330. Photo: Qatar 2022 Bid Committee\n\nOn the surface, it's just another white collar crime story: rich, powerful men making themselves richer and more powerful. But a closer look suggests that there is a lot of real-world suffering happening as a direct result of FIFA's decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the most obvious example of this, look to Qatar. The decision to award the 2022 World Cup to the rich Gulf state with a terrible human rights record was a controversial one right out of the gate. There have been extensive allegations of bribery: why else, some figured, award the Cup to a tiny country with sweltering summer heat and no football culture to speak of?\n\nHuman rights advocates' worst fears about Qatar seemed to be confirmed as Qatar began building the infrastructure to host the Cup, and reports of migrant worker deaths started to pile up. The numbers, to the extent that we know them, appear startling: A Guardian investigation last year revealed that Nepalese migrant workers were dying at a rate of one every two days. In sum, the Guardian put the total Qatar death toll of workers from Nepal, India and Bangladesh at 964 in 2012 and 2013.\n\nSecretary General of the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee Hassan Abdulla Al Thawadi earlier this year. Photo: Mohammed Dabbous\n\nIt is hard to know how many of those are specifically World Cup associated. Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers come to Qatar each year, and there could be hundreds of deaths even without a World Cup - figures from the Indian embassy show, for instance, that 200+ Indian workers died in Qatar in 2010, before the World Cup announcement. But the numbers could also be worse: a report by the International Trade Union Confederation has estimated 1200 deaths so far, with up to 4000 additional worker deaths by 2022.\n\nI've compared those fatality numbers for Qatar with worker fatality estimates for other major international sporting events in recent years. Some of these numbers are third-party estimates, others are based on official numbers that are almost certainly an under count. And it's tough to do an apples-to-apples comparison here, since the Qatar estimates include the deaths of all migrant workers after the announcement of Qatar's successful bid in 2010, while other countries' figures may only include deaths directly related to, say, stadium construction.\n\nIf current trends continue, the ITUC estimates that 4000 workers will die in Qatar by the time the World Cup is actually held in 2022.\n\nAl-Wakrah Stadium in Al-Wakrah. To be built. Expected capacity 45,120. Photo: Qatar 2022 Bid Committee\n\nQatar officials have previously pledged to address worker safety concerns. \"We believe that the people helping us build our country deserve to be fairly paid, humanely treated and protected against exploitation,\" the country's labour ministry told the Guardian. \"That is why we are reforming our labour laws and practices.\"\n\nStill, it's clear that Qatar has a troubled record when it comes to poor worker safety. Conditions for migrant workers there are so bad that the International Trade Union Confederation has called the state \"a country without a conscience\". Many of the abuses of migrant workers in Qatar and other Gulf countries are related to a governing system called \"kafala\" which dictates how migrant workers may enter the country. The system has been criticised for essentially placing workers under the complete control of their employers and leaving the door wide open for exploitation and abuse.\n\nIn the light of the new Justice Department investigation, Swiss authorities are announcing a new inquiry into the process that gave Qatar the Cup in 2010. If FIFA board members did indeed accept bribes from Qatar to let it host the 2022 cup, it would show how backroom corruption can have real human consequences.\n\nWashington Post",

Nepalese World Cup laborers in Qatar have been denied permission to return home to attend the funerals of loved ones and friends who perished in the recent earthquakes there.\n\nThe recent disaster killed more than 8,000 people, that country said. There are about 400,000 laborers in Qatar working on preparations for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nQatar has been under fire for the poor working conditions reportedly suffered by its labor force, which in addition to Nepal includes workers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Add to that the FIFA corruption scandal which erupted today, and this is not good news for Qatar. The U.S.-Swiss investigation includes the possibility that FIFA executives accepted bribes to ensure that Qatar was chosen as the 2022 World Cup host.\n\nNepalese labor minister Tek Bahadur Gurung has hardly been impressed with Qatar's efforts to aid its citizens. He said that while other Nepalese workers in Qatar have been allowed to leave, those working on the World Cup were denied, citing \"pressure to complete projects on time.\"\n\n\"They have lost relatives and their homes and are enduring very difficult conditions in Qatar. This is adding to their suffering,\" he added.\n\nNepal and other nations have been reluctant to speak out against Qatar due to the money that their workers are sending back to their cash-strapped home countries. But this latest development has apparently broken the silence.\n\n\"These are the people who are bringing the World Cup to Qatar. But we are a small, poor country and these powerful [organizations] are not interested in listening to us,\" said Gurung.\n\nMigrant workers have been the subject of rampant abuse from their Qatari employers, who've been likened to overseers of a modern day slavery operation. Under their \"kafala\" labor system, workers are tied to their employers for a set period, aren't allowed to change jobs without permission, and may even have their passports confiscated.\n\nFIFA has been pressuring Qatar to improve labor conditions, but evidently it's been a weak conversation, because nothing much has changed. Considering the current atmosphere, however (Ladbrokes is giving 3/1 odds for U.S. to replace Qatar as #WC2022 host), Qatar might now be willing to listen.",

                    "body": "\"What do you expect of a football organization? FIFA is not the lawmaker in Qatar.\"\n\nBefore Wednesday, the power of top officials in soccer's international governing body seemed to observe few legal boundaries. That was the upshot of a 47-count indictment against nine FIFA officials -- covered in more detail by my colleague David Graham -- seven of whom were just arrested at a five-star hotel in Zurich. Meanwhile, the Swiss attorney general is leading a separate investigation into another alleged abuse of power: the suspected \"criminal mismanagement and money laundering\" surrounding the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively.\n\nYet perhaps most troubling are the ways FIFA hasn't been using its power. To build the stadiums, transportation, and luxury hotels required for the 2022 tournament, Qatar needs workers, and immigrants make up some 90 percent of Qatar's workforce. Under the country's kafala labor system, employers control migrant workers' legal rights, including the right to find a new job or leave the country. Tek Bahadur Gurung, Nepal's labour minister, spoke to The Guardian after Nepalis in Qatar were barred from returning home to visit victims of April's earthquake: \"Nothing will change for migrant workers until FIFA and its rich sponsors insist on it,\" he said. \"We are a small, poor country and these powerful organizations are not interested in listening to us.\"\n\nBut FIFA's response has been to keep calm and confirm that Qatar won't lose the tournament. Germany's member of the FIFA executive board, Theo Zwanzinger, feigns helplessness in the face of worker abuses. \"This feudal system existed before the World Cup,\" he said. \"What do you expect of a football organization? FIFA is not the lawmaker in Qatar.\"\n\nIt's true that Qatar's abuse of migrant workers predates the country's being awarded World Cup hosting duties in 2010. That announcement brought attention to the conditions migrant workers face in the country, and in response to international criticism, Qatar's government promised limited reforms last year. But a new Amnesty International report found that the oil-rich Gulf nation is dragging its feet: \"On the crucial issues of the exit permit, the restriction on changing employers in Qatar's kafala system protection of domestic workers and the freedom to form or join trade unions -- there has been no progress whatsoever.\" Qatar's public-relations efforts have fallen flat too. The prime minister's office invited a group of journalists from the BBC to check on what the government itself called \"sub-standard labor accommodations.\" When the BBC tried to interview a group of workers from Nepal on their own, they were arrested and interrogated.\n\nOff the building sites, conditions are no better. \"We wake at four in the morning, get to work at about six and work until five in the evening. It takes an hour to get back to the camp. My room there isn't fit for humans -- six of us share and there's no place even to sit and eat,\" Imran, a 32-year-old Bangladeshi, told the BBC. An in-depth 2013 report from The Guardian called the abuses faced by Nepalese tantamount to \"modern-day slavery.\"\n\nIt's hard for a multinational institution that made $5.7 billion from 2011 to 2014 to play powerless. During the 2010 World Cup, FIFA convinced hosts South Africa to set up dedicated courts to hand out swift sentences to thieves who might ruin visiting fans' experiences. FIFA pushed Brazil to serve alcohol in stadiums during the 2014 tournament, despite the country's decade-old law banning the drinks at games for safety reasons. For the sake of this World Cup in Qatar -- where summer temperatures can soar above 100 degrees -- FIFA moved the 2022 tournament from summer to winter. But no such influence has been wielded to improve the conditions of those building the stadiums. Never mind that the French-Algerian soccer player Zahir Belounis was recently, by the same labor system that governs the Nepali migrants, trapped in Qatar for two years after a pay dispute with his team -- as yet, pressuring the 2022 host to treat foreign employees better is for FIFA a step too far.\n\nIt's too soon to tell whether today's arrests will bring real change for the 2022 tournament -- it would take a huge internal shakeup for FIFA to agree to a new vote, or choose a new host. But it is clear which organization connects, however indirectly, mistreated Nepali laborers to a luxury Swiss hotel a world away. FIFA.",

                    "body": "As the story unfolds, anything is possible. But for now, embattled FIFA President Sepp Blatter and his allies are circling the wagons.\n\nThe US end of the FIFA corruption investigation is currently focused on bribery and kickbacks worth over $150 million in North, Central, and South America.\n\nBut US investigators and their Swiss counterparts also appear eager to prove what the soccer world has long believed: That massive payoffs to FIFA executive committee (exco) members led to the awarding of the next two World Cups (Russia in 2018, Qatar in 2022). The Swiss prosecutors office said in a statement yesterday: \"It is suspected that irregularities occurred in the allocation of the FIFA World Cups of 2018 and 2022\" that involved \"unjust enrichment.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin reacted furiously today, suggesting the corruption probe is a political witch hunt to punish embattled FIFA President Sepp Blatter for awarding the cup to Russia. Before the arrests yesterday, Mr. Blatter had been a shoo-in to be elected to another term at a FIFA meeting scheduled for tomorrow. As things stand, he still controls enough votes to win, provided the election goes forward.\n\n\"I have no doubts at all that this is a clear attempt to prevent Blatter's re-election as president of FIFA, which is a flagrant violation of the working principles of international organizations,\" Mr. Putin told reporters. \"Our American partners are using such methods to reach their own selfish goals and are doing it illegally, persecuting people.\"\n\nRussia's World Cup is probably in the clear. Few doubt that votes were purchased in Russia's successful 2018 World Cup bid over England. That's standard procedure at FIFA's secretive exco, which doesn't reveal how its members vote. But that's as yet unproven.\n\nIn 2012, FIFA hired former US prosecutor Michael Garcia to carry out an investigation of possible corruption surrounding the successful Russian and Qatari bids. In 2014, FIFA banned Mr. Garcia's full report from publication and released a summary that exonerated Qatar and Russia. Mr. Garcia called the summary a misleading whitewash and quit. He complained of \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions\" in the Blatter-approved summary.\n\nBut at least in the case of Russia, the weather is cool enough in the summer and the country has a strong tradition in the game and reasonable infrastructure. The World Cup is just three years away, making alternatives much less likely.\n\nQatar 2022 is far more contentious as a host nation. The World Cup is traditionally played in the northern hemisphere summer to accommodate the wealthy European professional leagues, where the bulk of the globe's top players ply their trade. Summer temperatures in Qatar top 120 degrees Fahrenheit - dangerous for players, and even more dangerous for the migrant laborers now working on the crash program to build football stadiums.\n\nAt the time of Qatar's bid, the country only had three of the needed 12 stadiums. Labor conditions for the temporary workers the country relies on, most from the Indian subcontinent, are brutal. Workers typically have their passports confiscated by their employers when they arrive in the country and often find themselves paid far less than they were promised. Qatar's labor record was well known at the time of the bid, and the results since have been no surprise.\n\nThe International Trade Union Confederation estimates 1,200 workers have died building World Cup venues so far, and predicts the number will top 5,000 by 2022. By comparison, 10 people died on construction sites for Brazil's 2014 World Cup and two died building facilities for South Africa's 2010 World Cup.\n\nThere are other reasons that make Qatar a less than salubrious place for the event. The country does not have a free press. Engaging in gay sex can lead to prison terms, and drinking alcohol in public is also illegal.\n\nDuring Qatar's bid, Blatter said he believed its claim that it could build nine massive, fully air-conditioned stadiums (the experts were skeptical; the experts were right) and insisted he wouldn't try to move the tournament to the winter (which he is now trying to do.) That effort is enormously disruptive to powerful European clubs like Barcelona in Spain and Chelsea in the UK.\n\nQatar made so little sense at the time it won that the only rational explanation was backhanders to the exco. On top of everything else, Qatar - whose population of 2 million includes only 300,000 Qatari citizens - has never qualified for a World Cup.\n\nNone of this deterred Blatter and his fellow FIFA chieftains. Why?\n\nOne suspected reason is the interventions of Qatari tycoon Mohamed bin Hammam, a member of the exco when the World Cup was awarded. He was later found to have spent $5 million buying votes for the World Cup. Though he was kicked out of FIFA, officials within the organization have insisted that the bribery he was engaged in had nothing to do with the World Cup. They say his money was all about rigging a different internal vote at FIFA and so was not relevant.\n\nThe future of the Qatar World Cup is now very much in play. European clubs were already furious about the bait-and-switch played with its scheduling, since FIFA rules require them to release their players for the competition, even if it's midseason. Credit card giant Visa says it is already considering pulling its World Cup sponsorship. Sponsor Coca Cola said \"this lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup.\" Adidas has also expressed concern.\n\nMeanwhile, Blatter appears to be sticking to his guns. In Zurich today, former player and current head of the European football federation (UEFA) Michel Platini, told reporters that he begged with Blatter in a private meeting to stand down, but he was rebuffed. He went on: \"If Mr. Blatter wins, UEFA will meet in Berlin to discuss the future of our relations with FIFA.\"\n\nFIFA elections have generally been more like coronations under Blatter and his mentor and predecessor, Joao Havelange. The two men turned the distribution of patronage into an art form, with all votes cajoled or wheedled or threatened or simply bought well-ahead of time.\n\nThat's why Blatter's only opponent at the moment is a Jordanian prince. Sure, there was outrage over his handing the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, but opposing \"King Sepp\" was seen as a waste of time. Mr. Platini admits that UEFA is now in a \"minority\" inside FIFA. While most of the sport's billions of dollars are generated in the major European leagues - particularly England, Spain, Italy, and German - the national federations of the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, remain firmly on Blatter's side. And it's one federation, one vote.",

Photo: AFP\n\nWhat are the chances of Russia or Qatar being stripped of hosting the World Cup?\n\nFIFA so far has said the hosting of the 2018 World Cup in Russia and 2022 tournament in Qatar will continue as per schedule, but with the current situation deemed volatile, that could change. For the nations to be stripped of their hosting rights, widespread corruption throughout the original bidding process must be found by the Swiss authorities investigating such allegations. Qatar's bid in particular has been clouded by allegations of bribery since they won the vote in December 2010, however those claims came largely, if not entirely, from media reports rather than police. If the investigations led to convictions on corruption charges, not even FIFA could whitewash that.\n\nWould Australia bid again for the 2022 World Cup if the vote was reopened?\n\nFor years the Football Federation of Australia has maintained they would seriously contemplate bidding again for the World Cup despite gaining just one vote from a possible 22 in the original process. Should Qatar be stripped of its hosting rights and votes reopened, Australia would have about seven years to prepare to host the world's biggest event, but would expect strong competition from the US. The US is the nation best prepared to host a tournament in such short notice given their stadia and infrastructure and at one point in the voting process appeared favourites to win the 2022 World Cup hosting rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes it matter who the president is?\n\nIt is no secret that hopes of a revote would be boosted if Sepp Blatter was not president. Should either Qatar or Russia be found guilty of corruption in the voting process for the World Cup bids, Blatter's rival Prince Ali Al-Hussein appears the more likely to bring about change, although Blatter may be forced to reopen the vote to save his own image.\n\nWhich countries would bid in such event?\n\nIt would be safe to say that the US, England and Australia would resubmit bids for 2018 and 2022 after their failure in the first round as well as the hostile treatment they received from many senior FIFA executives in the wake of Russia and Qatar's victories. The Americans would feel justified in being awarded the 2022 World Cup given the work of the FBI in exposing corruption though their chances hinge on the Swiss police's findings of corruption on the Qatar bid. Already Mexico, Colombia, Canada and Morocco have expressed interest in hosting the 2026 World Cup and may fast-track their applications.\n\nWill Russia and Qatar have any course to appeal?\n\nIf they are found to have been corrupt in their behaviour in the initial voting process and are stripped of their rights to host the tournament, expect neither to surrender quietly. Russia has already built stadiums and will be ready to go but have not been nearly as heavily embroiled in corruption scandals as Qatar.

If current trends continue, nearly 4,000 people will die constructing stadiums by the time the World Cup actually begins -- a shocking 62 people per game played, according to a report by the International Trade Union Confederation.\n\nMigrant workers building World Cup infrastructure have allegedly been forced to work up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week in blistering summer temperatures of 110 degrees Fahrenheit or more, according to an Amnesty International report. Many workers are said to be living in \"squalid\" conditions, with employers holding on to their identification cards and exit visas and treating the workers themselves \"like animals.\"\n\nThe competition and its sponsor, FIFA, have already come under intense scrutiny due to allegations of bribery and human rights abuses. Fourteen senior FIFA officials were indicted on Wednesday for racketeering conspiracy and corruption, and although Qatar was cleared of corruption allegations last year, Swiss authorities have announced investigations into both Qatar's and Russia's World Cup bids. FIFA has said that neither hosting invitation will be rescinded.\n\nQatar has promised reforms amid the damning reports, but the government has thus far mostly failed to deliver.

                    "body": "It's an interesting question and very pertinent today. Typically in a situation where a sporting event, usually the Olympic Games or a Football World Cup, takes place in a region where there is conflict, political instability or some other undesirable situation, then the default reaction against those crying 'boycott' is that politics and sport do not mix.\n\nUsually I would be the first to agree. You see, I am one of these football fans that always buys the overpriced shirt, updates my membership at the best club in North London without fail every year and will generally bemoan the state of the beautiful game at length over a luke-warm pint of beer that has cost me \u00a34 (if I'm lucky). However, yet more allegations of corruption at the heart of Fifa, combined with ongoing revelations about workers' rights in Qatar make the situation harder and harder to ignore. At some point, supporting England should take second place to blatant and indefensible injustice.\n\nLet's look at what we know about the 2022 Qatar World Cup in particular.\n\nFlawed process\n\nIn my line of work, it is not uncommon to have to deal with a fairly detailed and painstaking procurement process. This is especially the case when chasing a government contract. However annoying this can be, it is something that you learn to accept because due process must be followed. You cannot just award contracts to your mates or someone to whom you owe a favour. As you might imagine, anything I have dealt with pales into insignificance when compared to the awarding of a World Cup. Which is what makes the whole sorry story around Qatar 2022 so mind boggling.\n\nThe process for selecting the hosts for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups lasted almost two years. In that time, all of those bidding for these tournaments had a clear understanding that they were supposed to be held in the summer. To be fair, the Qatar bid was always adamant that this was not a problem. Yet, having awarded the 2022 tournament to Qatar, Fifa subsequently decided that a summer World Cup would not work but chose to keep the tournament there anyway rather than rerun the bid process. An odd decision made all the more suspicious by a series of allegations of 'vote-buying' (later retracted) with an on-going whiff of something not being quite right with the whole process. The whole sorry affair has erupted again this week in spectacular fashion with a series of high profile Fifa executives being arrested. It is not clear if any of these arrests relate to the awarding of the 2018 or 2022 tournaments but we do now know that the FBI is undertaking a criminal investigation into both bids.\n\nWorkers' rights\n\nWhat makes the Qatar World Cup of particular concern is the appalling situation faced by migrant workers building the stadiums. A recent article in the Guardian from Marina Hyde makes for grim reading. Migrant workers face near 'slave like' conditions, passports confiscated, sub-standard living conditions and poverty wages. Play Fair Qatar estimates more than 62 workers will die for each game played in the tournament. Let that sink in.\n\nIt is here that I will revisit the original argument that politics and sport should not mix. Normally I would agree. Boycotting a sporting event because you do not like the actions of a particular government sets us on a difficult course. For example, I would never suggest boycotting the Russian World Cup over the situation in the Ukraine (others would disagree) because the two are not related. However, the situation faced by migrant workers in Qatar is not the result of some unrelated political issue. In fact, their situation is directly the consequence of the World Cup being hosted in Qatar in the first place. We should seriously ask ourselves if we are comfortable with that and if not what we propose to do about it.\n\nTaking a stand\n\nSo what should we do about it? I think now is the time for the FA (and its partners in the football world) to demand action. Uefa have already asked that the upcoming Fifa Presidential elections be postponed but this is not enough. Until a full, independent, investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bids is completed and until we are satisfied migrant workers in Qatar are being treated fairly then the Qatar tournament (at least) should be put on hold. The English FA should threaten to boycott the World Cup in Qatar if this does not happen.\n\nThis alone might not exert the necessary influence to ensure action is taken but it should surely make key international sponsors take notice. Then Fifa will surely listen. Encouragingly, VISA has already weighed in on worker rights in Qatar so I expect that sponsors would move quickly if one of the leading footballing nations threatened not to take part in the tournament. Others in Uefa could even follow. The time to act is now, when the world is watching and Fifa cannot wriggle out of its responsibilities as it so often has. Too much in this whole situation feels wrong for us to meekly remark that 'it's only a game'. We all hope football is not just about the money, now is the time to prove it.",

Reuters\n\nRecent World Cup bids have sparked fiery protests in the streets of Brazil against government spending, allegations of damning human rights violations in Qatar, and an international corruption scandal that put many of soccer's global leaders behind bars this week. And yet, even as FIFA's marquee event has become entangled in criminal allegations and reports of abuse, U.S. leaders are still as eager as ever to host a World Cup tournament and deal with all the headaches that come with it.\n\nThe motivation is not too hard to figure out. Soccer's biggest game means money, and the U.S. wants a cut. While hosting one of the world's most watched international athletic events can be an excessive expense for some nations with limited infrastructure, the U.S. stands to make a profit because it would take a relatively minor investment to prepare for the tournament, sports economists said.\n\n\"A World Cup in Russia, a World Cup in Qatar, a World Cup in Brazil is a huge disaster for the countries involved,\" said Victor Matheson, an economics professor who focuses on sports at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"A World Cup in the United States ... would almost certainly be positive.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice indicted nine current and former FIFA officials along with five executives on Wednesday. Later, a Swiss investigation into the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was announced in a statement.\n\nThe scandal seemed to bolster U.S fans' hopes of a domestic World Cup via a re-located 2018 Russia tournament or 2022 Qatar tournament. But FIFA quickly shot the idea down. \"Russia and Qatar will still be going ahead,\" said FIFA's director of communications and public affairs Walter De Gregorio Wednesday in a press conference.\n\nThe United States -- at least before the Justice Department charges -- was largely considered a favorite to win the 2026 World Cup bid. The United States already has myriad venues that could conceivably meet FIFA standards, including pristine NFL and college football stadiums. In the U.S. bid evaluation report for the 2022 World Cup, the 18 proposed stadiums required no additional construction plans, with just minor seating changes needed to meet FIFA requirements. The World Economic Forum competitiveness rankings pegged the United States at No. 12 in the world for infrastructure in 2014-15. Qatar ranked No. 24 and Brazil ranked No. 76.\n\n\"The U.S. has the facilities, and the cost of the U.S. hosting the World Cup would be relatively small,\" said Richard Sheehan, a sports economics professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and author of the book \"Keeping Score: The Economics of Big-Time Sports.\" \"If you need to do any extensive venue creation or remodeling, then the revenue is probably not going to cover all of those costs.\"\n\nSheehan estimated the total price tag of hosting the World Cup could come in under $1 billion. That is starkly different than say -- Qatar -- which is reportedly spending about $200 billion on its World Cup games. That huge sum goes toward building transportation infrastructure, constructing stadiums and upgrading tourist facilities.\n\nAn October 2009 study released by the USA Bid Committee on the 2018 and 2022 World Cup concluded the tournament would have a $5 billion impact on the U.S. economy. The study, performed by an outside consulting firm, found that a World Cup could add an estimated $400-600 million to each host city.\n\nU.S. Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati said as recently as early April that a U.S.-hosted World Cup would be a benefit to not only the country, but also an already scandal-ridden FIFA. ''It's probably now at least as important for the international community to be in the United States as it is for the United States, in terms of hosting the World Cup,'' Gulati said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton -- who served with the 2022 bid committee -- wanted the U.S. to host so desperately that he reportedly threw a tantrum and smashed a mirror when the bid lost to Qatar in 2014.\n\nA U.S. tournament would perhaps look a lot like Germany's 2006 World Cup, said Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts and author of the book \"Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and World Cup.\" The tournament was generally regarded as an economic success and brought in an estimated additional $2.65 billion for businesses. \"Germany's investment in hosting was minimal,\" he said, unlike other countries which had to build stadiums that didn't have a lasting use.\n\nBrazil, on the other hand, reportedly spent $3.6 billion just to build and refurbish 12 stadiums and an estimated $11.3 billion total in public works for its 2014 World Cup.\n\nFor the U.S., worrying about such costs wouldn't be an issue, Matheson noted. \"Everyone should walk away making money on this,\" he said",

                    "body": "FIFA President Sepp Blatter spent a weekend earlier this year with the emir of Qatar at the Al Bahr palace in Doha. It wasn't his first visit to the emir's Palace. Since the 2022 World Cup was controversially awarded to Qatar in December 2010, numerous meetings have taken place, modern-day slavery has been exposed and reforms have been promised.\n\nBut what Sepp Blatter didn't see in Qatar is that nothing has changed for workers. The walled Al Bahr palace is moments away from a patchwork of dirt streets known as the Industrial Area, home to 600,000 migrant workers building the infrastructure for Qatar to host the World Cup.\n\nBehind trucks beaten up by desert rocks, the only sign this is home to hundreds of thousands of men are the blue and grey overalls strung up to dry, ready for another 12-hour shift. The indignity of these squalid and unsafe conditions smacks of greed.\n\nIn a country consisting of only 250,000 Qatari nationals, there are 1.4 million migrant workers, making up around 90 percent of the workforce. They are treated as modern-day slaves. Over the next seven years, Qatar is embarking on a $150 billion spending spree as it gets ready to host the World Cup. Qatar will need another million workers to complete new roads, metros, railways, deep water port, hotels and stadiums. Whole cities will emerge from the sand.\n\nThe street grid of the industrial area is named like New York's Manhattan but comes with none of the freedom or hope. Meeting on 49th Street, late one evening, we are ushered quickly and quietly through a makeshift doorway made of corrugated steel.\n\nThe first thing you notice is the hundreds of pairs of scuffed and broken work boots lined up alongside bedroom walls. The men they belong to are washing, cooking or hidden in bunk beds in darkened rooms, where grown men share with eight, 10, 12 to a room. There is no space to unwind, there is no privacy.\n\nThe makeshift showers are little more than a trickle of water for hundreds of grown men to wash 12 hours of desert sweat away. Toilets are crammed next to kitchens. Spare cooking gas canisters are stored outside bedrooms. Four water taps offer the only water for cooking and drinking for 150 workers. The rush to reach the taps in the morning and late at night is a scene from refugee camps. Kitchen facilities are nothing short of squalid. Walls blackened with oil, and soot and grease hide the flies.\n\nFor the hundreds of men in this camp, this is not for just one day, many have become trapped for three, four or more years.\n\nNearly a year after the Qatar government promised long-awaited reforms, new accommodation standards and better conditions, the truth is nothing has changed. Nothing has changed except the Qatari government has increased their denial of the reality. Qatar's leaders knowingly choose to impose modern-day slavery -- the \"kafala system\" for more than 1 million migrant workers.\n\nKafala is the work visa system under which workers are recruited to build and service Qatar. Many borrow thousands of dollars to pay for illegal recruitment fees, are forced to live in squalor and are paid poverty wages in the richest country in the world.\n\nOnce at work, people are left without effective grievance procedures or dispute-settling measures and are at risk of injury or death with no records or responsibility from companies or the government. Then they are denied the choice to change jobs, held captive by an employer who alone can choose if and when to sign over ownership of the worker to another employer.\n\nIncreasingly, we see people trafficked into Qatar, brought into the country by a company with a fake contract, but on arrival are given no job or income for months. Relying on food hand-outs is the only thing that stops these young men from starving. Ultimately if any worker wants to escape this, they can then be denied an exit visa, as this is only granted by their employer, meaning they are trapped in Qatar.\n\nWhile Sepp Blatter sat in the emir's palace and was assured that migrant workers are happy and things have changed, I saw living conditions in camps that are more isolated and even more squalid than have been exposed in the past. I met workers who have a contract that is ignored, found that wages are getting lower and, for some African and Asian workers, felt the despair of people trafficked into Qatar without jobs and told to wait without wages for months.\n\nThis is the ugly face behind the glitter -- cities being built by workers who are not respected and valued for the massive contribution they are making to the future wealth of Qatar. Or the contribution they are making to allow FIFA to host the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThe discrimination, the racism, the denial of rights adds up to apartheid and a model of employment that is simply slavery. And there is a conspiracy of silence by governments and major sporting and cultural institutions that allow it to continue.\n\nIn two weeks, football associations around the world will vote for a new president of FIFA. FIFA can save itself from the catastrophe of a World Cup built on modern slavery in Qatar, by electing a candidate who will act decisively to support workers' rights. The world must not be duped by Qatar's empty promises of reform.",

Today, we can reveal how labourers are risking death by drinking cheap aftershave with dangerous levels of alcohol.\n\nQatar is a Muslim country and foreign workers have to obtain an official permit to buy booze, but to get a permit they have to earn over 4000 riyals (\u00a3713) per year.\n\nSome workers are paid so little they are instead turning to cheap aftershave - which can be deadly because of extreme alcohol levels.\n\nThe Sunday Mail has been told 500ml bottles of Blue Moon aftershave - which sells for just \u00a34 - is being drunk by workers.\n\nBlue Moon, made in Lebanon, is 70 per cent alcohol - double the strength of some vodkas.\n\nSharan Burrow, ITUC general secretary, said: \"Migrant workers have no other means of escape from their grinding daily reality. Race-based wage discrimination is rife in Qatar. There's no minimum wage.\n\n\"Instead Qatar forces countries to complete against each other in a race to the bottom for low wages.\n\n\"Workers from Nepal and Bangladesh are among the lowest paid.\n\n\"Labourers work six days a week, 10-12 hours a day for an average $300 a month in the richest country in the world.\"\n\nSiobhan Reardon, Amnesty International's programme director in Scotland, said: \"Wage inequality, and the hardships created by it, is just one of a range of unacceptable human rights abuses migrant workers in Qatar have to endure on a daily basis.\n\nPoll loading ...\n\n\"The Qatar authorities have the power to make positive changes to the lives of people exploited while building the future venues for the World Cup.\n\n\"We have repeatedly called on them to make meaningful reforms, but very little has yet been done.\n\n\"Surely the Qataris would prefer that the global focus was on positive achievements rather than being overshadowed by a range of horrific human rights abuses taking place during one of the highest profile international sporting events.\"\n\nNicholas McGeehan, Human Rights Watch's Qatar researcher, said: \"The Qatari authorities have ignored recommendations to investigate the troubling pattern of deaths in the construction sector and anything that makes workers more vulnerable to fatal heatstroke only adds to the concern.\"\n\nTry your hand at our daily news quiz:",

With the focus today on corruption charges, the world also mustn't forget that migrant workers in Qatar are still being worked to death as the World Cup infrastructure programme there accelerates to meet the 2022 deadline. FIFA has failed to make labour rights a condition of Qatar hosting the World Cup and impoverished workers there are paying the price.\"\n\nAmbet Yuson, General Secretary of Building and Woodworkers' International, which has been actively campaigning for labour reform in Qatar and engaging with multinational construction companies to get them to adopt an 11-point plan for workers' rights there, said, \"When FIFA puts money over human decency, workers are paying with their lives. The current leadership of FIFA believe that they stand above international law whether it regards corruption, working conditions or human rights. It is time for a change and new FIFA. We need leaders bold enough to take FIFA on a new road and implement international principles of workers' and human rights.\"\n\nThe new FIFA scandal coincides with the release today of a report by the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre on actions, or the absence of actions, by multinational construction companies operating in Qatar. According to the group, only a handful of companies are making serious efforts. http://business-humanrights.org/en/construction-firms-in-qatar-only-a-handful-make-serious-efforts-to-improve-conditions-for-migrant-workers\n\nYuson said, \"Workers in Qatar might get cheated by recruiting agents and exploited by sub-contractors, but in the end it is the big construction companies that are responsible for the working conditions on their sites. They must be able to answer on what they are doing to protect the rights of their workers.\"\n\nControversy is mounting inside Russia as well, with the ITUC's Russian affiliates FNPR and KTR condemning a proposal from a member of the national parliament to allow private companies to use prison labour to build infrastructure for the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\"Russia's trade unions fought back to amend the so-called 'FIFA law' which would have stripped away vital protections for World Cup workers, yet this proposal would allow companies to profit from using prison labour to build the facilities. FIFA has become synonymous with sacrificing human rights for profit. Only change at the very top can save FIFA from an unfolding disaster of its own making,\" said Burrow.",

Seriously, we could tell you that they took money from the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee -- the group responsible for countless human rights abuses and widely suspected of bribing FIFA for the rights to host the World Cup in 2022 -- and few would be surprised at this moment.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, they totally did that! Specifically, the Supreme Committee donated somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Foundation in 2014 -- years after they won the bid -- and the government of Qatar donated up to $5 million as well, possibly to appease Bill Clinton, who was an honorary chairman of the U.S.'s bid committee for the 2022 World Cup.\n\n\"When the U.S. lost the 2022 bid to Qatar, Clinton was rumored to be so upset he shattered a mirror,\" they wrote. \"But apparently Qatar tried to make it up to him.\"\n\nSo far, over a thousand workers have died in Qatar while building the World Cup's facilities, and at this rate, according to the International Trade Union Confederation, over 4,000 people will die before the first game begins.

FIFA could be a force for the betterment of the most popular and important sport on the planet and, by extension, for the planet itself. At times, it honestly is. At the very least it is such an entity for one month every four years, when the World Cup is contested. The sense of universality that envelopes the globe during those days -- there is an extraordinary value in this. But it certainly could be achieved without all the Machiavellian maneuvering.\n\nDuring a press conference in New York near midday, United States attorney general Loretta Lynch stood impressively before assembled journalists and television cameras and laid out an extensive corruption case against FIFA executives and sports marketing businesspeople whose alleged misdeeds date back more than two decades. It was noted the arrangement of the Copa Centenario tournament in the United States next summer involved an estimated $110 million in bribes.\n\nWhat was not mentioned by U.S. officials, except in response to some questions from the media, was the placement of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar (or its brutish cousin, the 2018 Russia World Cup).\n\nThe FIFA that is allowed these two afflictions upon the beautiful game to develop and has defended them at every opportunity. The FIFA that is has not taken sufficient action against Qatar to force the end to the kafala labor system that makes it virtually impossible for immigrant workers on the World Cup stadium projects to change jobs or depart the country; companies can take possession of immigrant workers' passports and refuse to allow their exit. Workers from Nepal whose families were affected by the recent earthquake apparently cannot leave for funeral services or to help their families deal with the disaster. The construction projects reportedly have claimed the lives of several hundred foreign workers; in all the work done in advance of Brazil 2014, eight laborers perished.\n\nEarly Wednesday, some FIFA executives were hiding behind bedsheets to avoid images of their arrests going worldwide as they were led in custody to waiting automobiles on the street outside their posh Zurich hotel. However it looked to us on video, this is not the moment we've been waiting for since \"Qatar\" appeared on that tiny card Blatter pulled from an envelope back in 2010.\n\nFIFA officials were escorted out behind sheets at the Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich http://t.co/LCuxIyugth pic.twitter.com/1M8SuQMSUu -- The New York Times (@nytimes)\n\nMay 27, 2015\n\nThe Swiss themselves are working on that, as even FIFA acknowledged in its press release, so there is hope the travesty of Qatar 2022 will be addressed, perhaps even avenged. It seems unlikely to be reversed, however. FIFA has impeded this possibility each time something new and horrid about the bidding process or construction project has been revealed, including the fact the basis for Qatar's entire bid was a sham.\n\nIn its proposal, Qatar promised the extreme June heat in that nation would be of no concern to players and fans during the course of each game because the stadiums built would feature \"environmentally friendly cooling technologies.\"\n\nApparently, the only \"environmentally friendly cooling technology\" the Qataris had in mind for actual use was: Winter.\n\nIn March, FIFA's executive committee approved a calendar for the 2022 tournament that included a final staged on Dec. 18.\n\nThere is only one way this can be stopped, and it must be stopped for the sake of returning world soccer to its rightful owners: us. By us, we mean not the American public or the American media but everyone from Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur to Cardiff to McKeesport who loves and cares about the game.\n\nThis is the most logical and necessary solution. The world's most powerful soccer leagues must stand up to FIFA, and they have to do it now, while the organization is at its weakest and there still is time to do something about the massively damaging World Cup arriving in seven years.\n\nEngland's Premier League, Germany's Bundesliga, Spain's La Liga -- all of them must say no. They must declare they will not be adjusting their 2022-23 schedules to accommodate a December World Cup in Qatar. Just no. Each of their businesses is going to be disrupted and inconvenienced by this charade; a business that is disrupted and inconvenienced is, inextricably, harmed.\n\nIf the governing bodies of world soccer had, several years ago, convened and determined it was high time for a World Cup in the Middle East and if the cost for such an event included staging that World Cup the heart of the club season it ought to be paid -- if that had occurred, there would be some justification for allowing it to continue.\n\nNo such discussion ever took place, however. In advance of the bid vote, Qatar promised a World Cup in the same summer window where the event has resided for generations. It was a classic bait-and-switch.\n\nThere are continued calls from around the world to reevaluate the Russia and Qatar World Cups, and Lynch was asked specifically about this issue during Wednesday's press conference. Alas, for all she and other law enforcement officials promised, this was not an area of specific concern for the U.S. government.\n\n\"I think FIFA has a lot of soul-searching to do as it tries to essentially monitor itself and improve the way in which it does business,\" Lynch said. \"And so the decisions on how those games are awarded and whether they go forward or not is really up to that particular body and we don't have impact on that decision. And we're not looking to, either.\"\n\nOnly genuinely injured parties can make it happen, and this is their opportunity.\n\nThose who care about what soccer can be -- indeed, what FIFA can be -- need to speak now.",

                    "body": "Qatar's 2022 World Cup is promising to be a rare example of a mega sporting event that leaves a legacy of social, political and economic change - but not in the way the Gulf state's ruling family had imagined.\n\nControversy about Qatar's successful bid coupled with world soccer body FIFA's failure to seriously tackle corruption in soccer governance in its own house as well as its regional federations, prominent among which the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), led to this week's unveiling of indictments against 14 senior current and past soccer FIFA executives and sports businessmen.\n\nThe scandal goes to the heart of not only financial corruption but also the enabling environment of political corruption rooted in the political sway of political forces often aligned with autocratic governments like those of the Middle East within FIFA, the AFC and the Olympic Council of Asia.\n\nThe scandal is compounded by mounting criticism of Qatar's controversial labour regime and the Gulf state's failure to so far make good on lofty reform promises. That has not only prompted global corporations who sponsor FIFA to speak out but also sparked discussion on the ethical responsibility of corporate sponsors embarrassed by what crusading journalist Andrew Jennings termed a criminal organization.\n\nGiven resistance to change within FIFA as well as several regional soccer bodies like the AFC, only three stakeholders had the potential of shaking soccer governance's tree: the judiciary, fans and corporate sponsors. Prosecutors in the US and Switzerland took the lead this week.\n\nThe US Department of Justice had a legal base with the presence on US soil of the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) - virtually all those indicted hail from the Americas --, the involvement of a prominent US national, the fact that potentially illicit US dollar payments were processed through US banks, and the legislative and judicial infrastructure capable of taking on a global investigation.\n\nBy contrast, fans with the exception of a few demonstrations and statements primarily in Britain and Scotland were largely apathetic to what was a far-from-my-bed show in the stratosphere of soccer while corporate sponsors also took a lead in recent weeks with sharp statements criticising controversial labour conditions in Qatar.\n\nThe corporates were joined this week by former and present international players who in a letter demanded that Qatar abolish its controversial kafala system or sponsorship system that puts workers at the mercy of their employers. The letter asserted that those working on the 2022 World Cup were being \"held hostage on the world's biggest building site\"\n\nThe combination of legal action in the United States and Switzerland coupled with corporate unrest should give Qatar reason for concern. The threat to Qatar's retaining its hosting rights is multi-fold and has increased substantially with the legal proceedings. The legal proceedings also threaten with the focus on sports rights companies to shine a spotlight on companies' cosy commercial relationships with soccer governance bodies that various regional federations, first and foremost among which the AFC, have sought to maintain at whatever cost.\n\nWhile the US investigation appears to be initial focused on events in the Americas and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, it is also looking at the 2011 FIFA presidential election that sparked the downfall of Mr. Bin Hammam. \u200eThat election is closely tied to the Qatari bid and together with the FIFA vote in favour of Russia, the focus of the Swiss criminal proceedings.\n\nFormer FIFA executive committee Chuck Blazer, who has already pleaded guilty and is cooperating with US authorities, played an important role in bringing down Mr. Bin Hammam. Mr. Blazer allegedly sat next to Mr. Bin Hammam during the December 2, 2010 FIFA executive committee meeting that voted in favour of Qatar and watched\u200e the Qatari tick off a list of names of those voting for the Gulf state. The assertion was that Mr. Bin Hammam's list included the names of those whom he had bought.\n\nSimilarly\u200e, the sons of disgraced soccer executive, Jack Warner, Darry and Daryan Warner a former FIFA executive committee member and Bin Hammam associate, have followed Mr. Blazer in working with US authorities. Jack Warner, one of the 14 indicted executives, turned himself in to police in Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday night local time.\n\nMr. Warner was instrumental in Mr. Bin Hammam's campaigns for both the Qatar World Cup and the FIFA presidency. Mr. Warner resigned from FIFA in 2011 to avoid legal proceedings by the soccer body. Mr. Warner warned at the time that he would bring the house down on FIFA after he released an email from FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke asserting that the Qatar World Cup had been bought.\n\nWhile the US and Swiss proceedings \u200efocus on financial corruption, they are unlikely to tackle the equally serious problem of political corruption resulting from the close association of soccer and political corruption that often served as an enabler for illicit financial dealings and are at the heart of FIFA's Qatar and Russia-related scandals, the Bin Hammam affair and the AFC scandals the group is seeking to suppress.\n\nThis blog together with the Malay Mail sparked the suspension earlier this month of AFC general secretary Dato Alex Soosay pending investigation into allegations that he attempted to have documents hidden or destroyed related to multiple potentially illegal payments as well as the group's corporate dealings.\n\nAFC president Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, a member of the Bahraini ruling family that in 2011\u200e brutally crushed a popular revolt during which some 150 athletes and sports executives were arrested. They included on Sheikh Salman's watch as head of the Bahrain Football Association national soccer team players who were reportedly tortured. Sheikh Salman failed to stand up for his players or address the allegations against him.\n\nSheikh Salman has further gone out of his way to bury an independent audit that disclosed massive financial shenanigans within the AFC and raised serious questions about the group's $1 billion master rights agreement with Singapore-based World Sports Group. (WSG). WSG's legal effort to force this author to disclose sources failed in 2014 with a damning Singapore Supreme Court ruling against it.\n\nThe US and Swiss legal proceedings put the Qatari World Cup bid in the spotlight.\u200e Recent revelations by The Sunday Times leave little doubt about corruption in the Qatari bid. But to be fair, Qatar and Russia played the game the way it is played in FIFA. England lost its 2018 World Cup bid for the simple reason that it insisted on walking a straight and ethically and legally correct line.\n\nAs a result, depriving Qatar of its hosting rights without also tackling Russia and more importantly radically reforming FIFA and soccer governance worldwide to root out a culture of financial and political corruption would turn the Gulf state into a scapegoat. Moreover, the question is, what is the most favourable result of the legal proceedings: uprooting a deep-rooted culture, enabling sporting mega events to be vehicles of change or punitive retribution?\n\n\u200eWhile Qatar scrambles to counter potential fallout from the legal proceedings, it is certain to feel pressure to act swiftly to address concerns about the working and living conditions of workers, including those involved in World Cup-related construction projects. Migrant workers constitute the majority of Qatar's population.\n\nTo Qatar's credit, it stands out since winning its World Cup hosting rights as the only Gulf state to engage with its critics in a part of the world that incarcerates or bars entry to those who don't tow the autocrats' line. Qatar has in recent weeks been under fire for failing to make good on lofty promises and cracking down on its critics as well as foreign media reporting on labour and World Cup-related issues.\n\nQatar's engagement was a first step in the kind of change the 2022 World Cup can spark. So is the fact that corporate sponsors are rethinking what it means to grant financial support.\n\n\"What are brands Adidas, Gazprom, Hyundai, Kia, McDonald's, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Visa to do over allegations of improper conduct in working conditions at the 2022 World Cup building sites in Qatar?... A brand's moral compass is being tested here and whilst many brands had commented last year, most notably Adidas who's association with FIFA extends to 2030, issued statements alongside Sony... As consumers we can influence and help brands recognise and understand that as global citizens our expectation is that we'd at least like them to demonstrate that they care and lead by example,\" said David Todaro, writing in Branding Magazine.\n\nJames M.

Allegations of bribery amounting to over $100 million have rocked soccer's world governing body but this story isn't just about money. It's also important to mention the deaths that are going to be associated with soccer's showpiece event in 2022.\n\nThe decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar didn't just raise eyebrows. It also created a storm of controversy and disbelief. The World Cup would take place in a tiny nation with a questionable human rights record, barely any soccer culture, and in a climate where playing the sport would be nearly physically impossible. More importantly, however, migrant workers have been dying in droves since Qatar started work on the infrastructure for the event.\n\nEven though it's difficult to obtain data on the exact number of fatalities, a Guardian investigation revealed migrant workers in Qatar, primarily from Bangladesh, India and Nepal, were dying at the rate of one every two days. The Washington Post compared these figures with other sporting events to gauge the sheer scale of the situation in Qatar. Even though it's also difficult to divulge which deaths are directly associated with the World Cup, numbers are almost certain to be high. Whether corruption is proven or not, the decision to host the event in such a country is already having far-reaching and fatal consquences. If the current trend continues, 4,000 migrant workers will die in Qatar by the time a ball is kicked in 2022.\n\n*Click below to enlarge (charted by Statista)",

The indictments allege that vote-buying occurred in past World Cup host selections, and there have been other allegations that millions of dollars were paid to rig the vote for Qatar in 2010.\n\nAnd when you look at all the World Cup hosts since 1978, it's clear that Qatar is in many ways an outlier.\n\nCompared with other World Cup hosts, Qatar is at the extremes on almost every metric I looked at. The data wasn't perfect -- two of the data sets I used weren't measured annually when it would have been ideal if they were (the United Nations Development Program's carbon-emissions reading and Reporters Without Borders' Press Freedom Index). Also, the Press Freedom Index did not exist before 2002, so I used the 2002 mark for the World Cups that came before that year. It's an estimation, but because that measurement is less susceptible to annual change, I felt safe in using it. And one last thing while we're here: The Elo and GDP numbers for Russia and Qatar aren't projections but are the most recent data available.\n\nQatar was definitely not selected for its temperate weather in June, the typical time for the FIFA tournament. There has historically been some variation here -- Argentina's average June temperature is in the low 50s (it being in the Southern Hemisphere and all), and Mexico's is in the mid-70s. But Qatar's average June temperature is in the 90s.\n\nPerhaps Qatar is a real soccer up-and-comer, then? Not quite! I pulled the Elo rating of each men's national team on the first game they played the year they hosted the cup to get the gist of how good the teams were on the world stage. Qatar has the second-lowest score ever.\n\nAnd it's not like Qatar holds a bulk of the world's population, either. Typically the country that gets the cup has somewhere around 1 percent to 5 percent of the world's population, but not Qatar. With a projected population of 2.24 million in 2022, it'll have a whopping 0.03 percent of the global population within its borders in a few years, not counting the spectators. What's more, that population mostly comprises people who weren't born in Qatar -- as of 2013, according to the U.N., 1.6 million of the country's 2.2 million people were international migrants.\n\nAlthough Qatar will be a global hub for sports journalists in several years, FIFA apparently did not select the country to highlight its illustrious human-rights record. Qatar has extreme restrictions on press freedoms that put it in league with Russia (the 2018 host) and Brazil (the 2014 one). They have a very high score on the Press Freedom Index, where a low score indicates a great deal of freedom.\n\nIt's also not for the nation's climate record, either, as it's by far the highest polluter -- measured in metric tons of carbon emitted per capita. And that's on a list that includes America. That was our category to lose!\n\nBut Qatar does have one metric by which it is off-the-charts outstanding: gross domestic product per capita. Namely, it's a small country that makes a whole lot of money. In the chart, we're looking at the ratio of GDP per capita the year each nation hosted the cup to the United States' GDP per capita that year, to keep it apples to apples.\n\nNone of this proves vote-rigging, obviously. But when a country lacks many of the competitive advantages of other countries' bids, some extra scrutiny is probably worthwhile.",

They're being extradited to the United States to face federal corruption charges.\n\nBut corruption and FIFA have long gone together like soccer crowds and vuvuzelas.\n\nNo, the time for competing na\u00adtions, not to mention FIFA's many cor\u00adporate sponsors, to take a principled stand would have been well before the entire sporting world was paying attention.

The average high temperature in Qatar in July is 113 degrees, far from ideal for a sport played outdoors and involving a great deal of running. Not to worry, FIFA did decide to move the tournament to November -- when the average temperature is a cool 90 degrees.\n\nSadly, the health risk to players and spectators is nothing compared to that of the people who will construct the venues needed to host the World Cup. Qatar is a modern-day slave state, and an estimated 4,000 migrant workers\u00ad will die building event sites before a single ball is kicked.\n\nMany of these workers are from Nepal, where an earthquake left more than 8,000 dead. This week, Qatar reportedly refused to allow workers\u00ad to return to their home country for their loved ones' funerals. It's not enough that Nepalese workers have died at a rate of one every two days during construction, now they're denied a chance to mourn friends and family.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more shocking dis\u00adregard for human life.\n\nIt would have been nice for the partici\u00adpating nations and businesses like Coca-Cola and Budweiser to stand up and say no before now.

That's speculation, but certainly possible.\"\n\nCanada, which will host the Women's World Cup starting June 6, could prove an attractive option providing many of the same benefits as the United States.\n\nLalas said soccer has grown tremendously in the United States since 1994 and getting the 2026 bid \"would be a success unlike anything that FIFA has seen in the past.\"\n\n\"I have no problem saying that,\" he said. \"And that's not just the American in me coming out.\"",

Searing heat that makes it impossible to play the World Cup during its traditional summer timeframe. Conservative mores that frown on alcohol, causing just a tad bit of awkwardness considering one of the tournament's biggest sponsors is a beer maker. Billions spent on stadiums that aren't needed in a country with little soccer tradition.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBrennan: Sepp Blatter's FIFA finally starts to face accountability\n\nNow we wish that were the case, with allegations that the Qataris bought the World Cup rather than winning it fair and square. Instead of letting its bid stand against others, including one from the United States, Swiss prosecutors are investigating whether Qatar gave FIFA officials bribes and kickbacks in exchange for their votes.\n\n\"The beautiful game was hijacked,\" FBI Director James Comey said in announcing a separate, 47-count indictment that alleges two generations of soccer officials sold everything in their game - from soccer fields for kids in developing nations to the 2010 World Cup - to the highest bidder.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFIFA officials arrested on corruption charges\n\nAnd that's not even the worst part of it. Qatar's record on human rights isn't just bad, it's abysmal. Discrimination against women is endemic, and homosexual activity remains illegal. Qatar's treatment of migrant workers - you know, the folks building the stadiums for the World Cup - is tantamount to modern-day slavery, with multiple reports of late or no payment of wages, employers confiscating passports and life-threatening working conditions.\n\n4 CONNECT 8 TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE",

As a result, major World Cup sponsors like Visa and Adidas have issued stern statements of concern, but have not pulled their sponsorships.\n\nA number of designers online have taken up the mantle of pressuring those same sponsors by redesigning their corporate logos, tweaking the art and adding the slogan \"proud sponsor of the human rights abuses of World Cup 2022.\" They have submitted designs with the logos of Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Adidas, Sony and others.\n\nThe new logo designs are being posted at Bored Panda, where anyone on the Web can submit additional designs.

Yet, the other soccer federations that bid for these tournaments -- including the U.S. for 2022 -- are no doubt analyzing Wednesday's fallout, looking for ammo to reopen the bidding process.\n\nA country has never been stripped of a World Cup bid. In May 1982, Colombia backed out as host of the 1986 Cup citing economic concerns. Mexico was selected as the replacement host six months later.\n\nAny move to strip a country of a World Cup would likely be met with immense legal hurdles given the amount of money Russia and Qatar have already poured into their respective tournaments. But the U.S., which hosted the best-attended Cup ever in 1994, is well positioned to pick up a World Cup on short notice given its existing stadiums and reliable transportation options. It was even floated as a backup option for 2010 when host nation South Africa reportedly fell behind in its preparations.",

The U.S. indictment Wednesday outlined two decades of fraud, and Swiss officials said they're investigating alleged money laundering related to the selection of the host countries for the next two World Cups, in Russia and Qatar.\n\n\"Now there is more concern than there was previously about investigations, now it's federal-level investigations from Switzerland and U.S.,\" Ahmed Shehada, the head of advisory and institutions at NBAD Securities LLC, said by telephone. Qatar isn't \"going to be as aggressive with infrastructure spending\" without the World Cup, he said.\n\n$200 Billion\n\nQatar, a country about the size of Connecticut, is spending about $200 billion on infrastructure before hosting the world's most-watched sporting event. The plan includes at least eight new stadiums and a $35 billion metro and rail system. New highways are being laid and a city for 200,000 people is rising north of Doha, the capital.\n\nShares in Ezdan Real Estate Company QSC led the drop, plunging 10 percent, the most since December. Qatar National Bank SAQ, which has the biggest weighting on Doha's benchmark gauge, slipped 1.2 percent to the lowest since April 23.\n\nThe Qatari government has denied any wrongdoing, and FIFA said the venues won't change.",

Losing the 2022 World Cup could affect Qatar's financial markets.\n\nThe Qatar country-specific exchange traded fund plunged Wednesday and briefly tested its short-term supporting level, after a sweeping probe alleged rampant corruption in FIFA over bids for the World Cup.\n\nThe iShares MSCI Qatar Capped ETF (NASDAQ:QAT) fell as much as 2.3% early Wednesday, but managed to pare the steep losses somewhat in afternoon trading.\n\nIn contrast, other emerging markets remained relatively unchanged on Wednesday. For instance, the iShares MSCI UAE Capped ETF (NASDAQ:UAE) was down 0.1%, and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:EEM) was 0.2% lower.\n\nThe Qatari QE Index declined 1.5% Wednesday, the most since April 1, in response to the FIFA corruption charges and Qatar's awarded right to host the 2022 World Cup, reports Dana El Baltaji for Bloomberg.\n\nSwiss investigators are looking into records from FIFA's headquarters as part of a criminal probe into the 2010 vote that awarded Russia the 2018 World Cup. Meanwhile, in the U.S., charges detailed \"rampant' corruption in international soccer, including bribes and kickbacks for contracts to market and televise the tournament.\n\n\"The Qatari market is real estate and banking-centric, and the World Cup event is very important to these two sectors,\" Nabil Rantisi, the managing director of brokerage at Mena Corp. Financial Services, said in the Bloomberg article. \"Since companies in those are the two biggest sectors represented on Qatar's index, it's only natural the gauge would drop.\"\n\nThe country has planned $200 billion in projects, including stadiums, roads and hotels, in anticipation of hosting the World Cup event.\n\nQAT includes a hefty 59.6% tilt toward the financial sector, followed by industrials at 15.1%, telecom at 7.8%, energy at 5.6%, utilities at 4.7% and materials at 3.5%.\n\nAdditionally, Qatar, along with other Gulf state markets, weakened on Wednesday as oil prices continued their downward descent.\n\nBrent crude oil futures fell 2.0% to $62.4 per barrel on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the United States Brent Oil ETF (NYSEARCA:BNO) declined 2.1% and also fell below its 50-day simple moving average.\n\nMarket observers are attributing the pullback in oil to the renewed strength in the U.S. dollar.\n\n\"Crude oil is at the mercy of the dollar index,\" Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc., said in a Wall Street Journal article. \"You've got so many other pieces you would think would be supportive, but [the market] is totally discounting them.\"\n\niShares MSCI Qatar Capped ETF\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\nMax Chen contributed to this article.\n\nSource: FIFA Scandal Drags On Qatar ETF\n\nDisclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

                    "body": "Systematically and mercilessly disassembling, flushing, greasing, and re-packing the cycling culture.\n\nThe sporting world is all abuzz with this whole FIFA kerfuffle, which much to my chagrin has not yet yielded a headline along the lines of \"FIFA FAUX FUM: FEDS FELL FOOTBALL FELONS.\" It has, however, made for some interesting reading. Consider this for example:\n\nFor the most obvious example of this, look to Qatar. The decision to award the 2022 World Cup to the rich Gulf state with a terrible human rights record was a controversial one right out of the gate. There have been extensive allegations of bribery: why else, some figured, award the Cup to a tiny country with sweltering summer heat and no soccer culture to speak of?\n\nWhy indeed? Besides the piles of dead migrant workers, there's no civil liberty in Qatar:\n\nQatari law does not permit the establishment of political bodies, forums for debate, professional syndicates or trade unions. There are no civil society organizations for human or citizens' rights, nor any association or institution with a focus on public affairs. There is no transparency regarding major public policy decisions. Qatar's income, expenditure, and investment of public wealth are unknown.\n\nThough there is flogging for \"illicit sexual relations:\"\n\nFlogging is used in Qatar as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations.\n\nWhich somehow they manage to reconcile with building a stadium that looks like a giant vagina:\n\nHowever, Qatar is a great place if you like getting stoned:\n\nNo, silly, not that kind of stoned.\n\nTHIS kind of stoned:\n\nStoning is a legal punishment in Qatar. Apostasy is a crime punishable by the death penalty in Qatar. Blasphemy is punishable by up to seven years in prison and proselytizing can be punished by up to 10 years in prison. Homosexuality is a crime punishable by the death penalty for Muslims.\n\nWow. I'm all for appreciating the folkways of different cultures, but Qatar fucking sucks.\n\nAnyway, I'm sure it won't surprise you to learn that if the scumbags at FIFA are willing to jump into bed with this country then they'll find cycling already in there and fellating the Emir, for Qatar will be hosting the 2016 UCI Road World Championships:\n\nNot only is it hot as balls in Qatar, but there aren't even any climbs, which are like kind of a little bit important in bike racing:\n\nNone of the routes will contain climbs with the race organisers stating that they did not consider creating artificial climbs for the events.\n\nTo their credit, it's a good thing they're not building any artificial climbs, because that's probably like five dead migrant workers per meter of elevation.\n\nSo why is Qatar so keen on hosting sporting events? Well, apparently they want to host the Olympics one day, because they're filthy fucking rich:\n\nAnd why the effort? Most communities pay to host the worlds to bring in tourism dollars. Qatar, however, is rich -- the richest country in the world in 2010 according Forbes magazine. Its move is not for tourism. It is hosting the worlds and other events, like soccer's World Cup in 2022, to eventually bring in the Olympics.\n\n\"Everybody knows -- it's not a secret -- that we have ambitions for the Olympics,\" Sheikh Khalid said. \"We must test every discipline to show it can performed with success in Qatar.\"\n\nYes, every discipline can be performed with success in Qatar, provided its not a sex act that goes against Sharia law.\n\nOf course, cycling and ethical bankruptcy have always gone together, but if you're looking for someone to credit with marrying cycling and out-and-out human oppression then look no further than Eddy Merckx:\n\nNot only did Merckx create the Tour of Qatar, but he's also race director of the Tour of Oman. You know Oman--it's that place where you're not taking your next vacation:\n\nThe practice of torture is widespread in Oman state penal institutions and has become the state's typical reaction to independent political expression. Torture methods in use in Oman include mock execution, beating, hooding, solitary confinement, subjection to extremes of temperature and to constant noise, abuse and humiliation. Since 2011, the Omani government has arrested and tortured many Omanis, and there have been numerous reports of torture and other inhumane forms of punishment perpetrated by Omani security forces on protesters and detainees. Several prisoners detained in 2012 complained of sleep deprivation, extreme temperatures, and solitary confinement.\n\nWow, that's bad. In fact, they sound almost as bad as America!\n\nAt least they abolished slavery--in 1970:\n\nOman was the one of the last nations on earth to abolish slavery in 1970.\n\nYeah, that's 1970 A-friggin'-D.\n\nIf slavery was legal in your country until the release of \"Led Zeppelin III\" then that's seriously fucked up.\n\nAnyway, you may remember this past year when riders' tires exploded during the Tour of Oman owing to the extreme heat, and Merckx basically dismissed their concerns as nothing more than a bunch of whining:\n\nMerckx retorted that had the peloton been racing, the heat would not have been a concern.\n\n\"It was only 38 [100\u00b0F], that's not so hot,\" he said. \"The problem was that the riders came down in a bunch and everyone was braking. If they would've been racing, coming down one by one, the problem wouldn't have occurred.\"\n\nHe added that the race's future was at stake.\n\nRight, that would be terrible if Merckx's filthy revenue stream dried up because the riders have a self-preservation instinct. Sadly Freds are so busy whacking off to what this guy did 40 years ago that nobody notices what an asshole he is:\n\nMeanwhile, here in America's Most Bike-Friendly City according to Bicycling magazine, the transit workers' union is bravely fighting for their right to run you the fuck over with their buses, and to this end they've filed a class action suit against Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City of New York:\n\nI notice the pedestrian's airbag helme(n)t didn't deploy either.",

The preparations have been marred by reports of unsafe working environments, physical and sexual abuse, with some groups estimating that thousands of workers have already died on the job.\n\nUnder the country's kafala sponsorship system, migrant workers are tied to their employers and cannot leave the country without their permission.\n\nQatar and Cambodia originally endorsed the plan in 2008, the same year as it signed an agreement to send workers to nearby Kuwait.\n\nBunny of the Labour Ministry said five companies had been granted licences to send workers to the two countries in recent months, adding that the firms would not be allowed to send the workers they recruit until a formal agreement was reached.\n\nOne firm, KCTC Manpower Supply, a Korean-owned company, has already begun its recruitment process.

                    "body": "Five international footballers have demanded Qatar abolish the labour system that allows migrant workers to be \"held hostage on the world's biggest building site\" ahead of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe move comes on the same day that Swiss and US prosecutors launched criminal corruption probes into FIFA, following the arrests of nine officials and five executives on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and corruption.\n\nAmong the signatories is former England international Lee Dixon, former French internationals David Ginola and Vikash Dhorasoo, current LA Galaxy midfielder and US international Robbie Rogers and Moroccan defender Abdes Ouaddou, who personally experienced the draconian kafala system whilst playing in Qatar.\n\nThe letter, organised by campaign group Avaz, reads: \"Over one million workers, a majority of them immigrants from poor nations, are effectively held hostage on the world's biggest building site which experts say could see 4,000 people dying even before the first ball is kicked. The name of this beautiful sport should not be sullied by the blood, sweat and tears of those who are building this spectacle. We call on FIFA, Qatar and all the construction firms profiting from this business to abolish this kafala system.\"\n\nUnder kafala laws, local companies sponsor foreign workers, meaning the employee's right to work is entirely in the hands of the employer. This leaves the worker open to exploitation; in some cases employers even take worker's passports, meaning they can no longer leave the state. Labourers are then forced to live in terrible conditions with no rights and no recourse to legal action.\n\nAccording to Avaz, Western construction companies benefiting from cheap labour in Qatar are risking potential liability under EU and US legislation for corruption and bribery in the labour supply chain. Alaphia Zoyab, Global Campaigner with Avaaz, said: \"Young men from South Asia are working under slave-labour laws while the profits continue to pour into FIFA and the building firms. People and footballers across the world are now speaking as one -- Qatar must end this kafala system which belongs in another century.\"\n\nOuaddou, who played for Fulham and Nancy, said: \"We must stop the archaic kafala system which is little more than slavery. It's time for the world of football to end the tragedy in Qatar.\"",
