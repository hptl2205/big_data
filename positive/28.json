Now, she lives in a tiny tent in what amounts to a small refugee camp for twins and their mothers.\n Meeting the tribal elders was a shocking experience.  Asking them why they believed it was taboo to raise twins, the journalists got a troubling response.\n They said, \"to us, asking us to raise twins is like asking us to eat our own shit.  As long as we are still alive we are not going to dilute our ancestral culture ... we have a saying - that anyone who keeps twins has no soul,\" one other elder said.\n Most twins are abandoned in this part of Madagascar, but it makes them more likely to be adopted abroad.  Twins are placed for adoption, usually going to start new lives in France, Sweden, Italy or Canada.  A few are also adopted locally, sometimes informally amongst villages and extended families who don't belong to the same tribe, or are wealthier and more educated.",

Today, they're completely caught up with their peers, and in some cases, ahead.\n The Weavers don't take any of it for granted.  For the past decade, they've made it their mission to raise money for other premature babies who will benefit from future research.\n \"We don't want to forget.  We have two very healthy boys today, but it didn't start out that way.  There are a lot of parents who don't have their babies or are struggling with the side effects of prematurity today,\" LoraLee Weaver said.  \"Our twins Jack and Andrew turned 10 in February so we're obviously excited for that -- and we decided to raise the goal significantly to $10,000.\" \"\nIt's a big goal, but they said they're ready for the challenge.

Mientras Rafa lidera con 1.860 puntos m\u00e1s que 'Nole', la distancia del serbio con el n\u00famero tres del mundo, el suizo Stanislas Wawrinka- es de 4.460 puntos, una barbaridad.\n El jugador suizo ha comenzado la temporada fenomenal.  Fue campe\u00f3n en su primer Grand Slam en el Open de Australia venciendo a un Rafa Nadal que sufri\u00f3 problemas de espalda, pero esto no le quita m\u00e9rito al jugador helv\u00e9tico, que derrotar\u00eda a su paisano y compa\u00f1ero de dobles Roger Federer en la final de Montecarlo.  Adem\u00e1s, Stanislas lleg\u00f3 a este \u00faltimo partido deshaci\u00e9ndose en semifinales de un especialista en tierra como es David Ferrer-finalista en a\u00f1o pasado en Roland Garros.\n En el n\u00famero 4 se encuentra Roger Federer, campe\u00f3n en Madrid en tres ocasiones.  Una vez con la superficie dura del Madrid Arena-en 2006 y otras dos sobre tierra batida en 2009 y 2012-esta \u00faltima sobre la pol\u00e9mica tierra azul en la que sucumbieron tanto Djokovic como Nadal-.  El suizo lleva los mismos triunfos que Nadal en Madrid, son los dos m\u00e1s laureados con tres trofeos cada uno.\n David Ferrer, quinto del mundo, no ha llegado ni siquiera a disputar una final en la capital de Espa\u00f1a.  El otro espa\u00f1ol que ha ganado el torneo fue el ex n\u00famero 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero sobre pista r\u00e1pida en la temporada 2003.  Su mejor resultado en Madrid son las semifinales del a\u00f1o 2010 en las que fue eliminado por Roger Federer en tres sets.  Y del n\u00famero 6 al 10 solo un tenista sabe lo que es jugar una final en Madrid, y en este caso perderla, se trata de Thomas Berdych, que cay\u00f3 frente a Federer en 2012.",
