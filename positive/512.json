Obama has also spoken to many top administration officials about whether they would stay on for the last two years of his presidency, the official said.\n\n.\n\nThe announcement also comes as Obama approves plans to give U.S. military commanders bigger roles alongside Afghanistan forces as they fight the Taliban following the end of the U.S. combat operation next month.\n\nDiscussions about Hagel picked up momentum Friday, according to a senior Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly. By the weekend, the decision had been made and there was concern it would leak.\n\nSpate of crises\n\nA series of foreign policy crises, including the rise of the Islamic State and the slow response to the Ebola epidemic, contributed to the need to for a change in senior personnel, the official said.\n\nAnother senior Defense Department official said Hagel did not clash with the White House on policy, nor was he stepping down in protest.\n\nThe New York Times, citing anonymous sources, first reported the resignation Monday.\n\nObama nominated Hagel in January 2013 to succeed Leon Panetta. As a former senator from Nebraska who had forged a friendship with Obama in the Senate, Hagel became the only Republican on Obama's national security team.\n\nHagel got off to a rocky start even before he was sworn in. His confirmation hearings before the Senate were contentious -- even with former colleagues from his own party. Although relations with Capitol Hill improved over the past two years, Hagel still struggled to articulate Pentagon policies in briefings and speeches.\n\n'A patriot'\n\n\"Secretary Chuck Hagel and I have had our differences over many years, but I have always considered him a friend, a patriot and a dedicated public servant who has always put our country first and the needs of our men and women in uniform above his own,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement.\n\nHe also said Hagel was frustrated by the administration's national security policy and decision-making process, and that defense secretaries have been micro-managed by the Obama White House.\n\nThe defense secretary had planned a trip to Asia, including a scheduled stop in Vietnam that had personal meaning for Hagel. When it was canceled earlier this month, Pentagon sources said the change signaled trouble for Hagel's tenure -- but officials from the White House and Pentagon immediately denied that Hagel was considering or being pushed to step down.\n\nHagel was the first enlisted combat veteran to serve as secretary of Defense.\n\n\"He's been in the dirt. He's been in the mud. And that has established a special bond. He sees himself in them. They see themselves in him,\" Obama said.\n\nPOSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS\n\nAdministration officials said possibilities for Chuck Hagel's job include Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of Defense for policy who was runner-up for the slot when President Barack Obama tapped Hagel in early 2013; Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., a defense specialist and a former officer with the Army's 82nd Airborne; and Ashton B. Carter, a former deputy secretary of Defense.\n\nReed disavowed any interest. \"Senator Reed loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate,\" said press secretary Chip Unruh.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1vHAb9V",

Hagel will remain in the job until a successor is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHagel was appointed less than two years ago as Obama pushed his signature programme of winding up wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a process that is being upended this year with US re-engagement in Iraq and greater military cooperation with Kabul.\n\nThe former Republican senator, who had struggled to improve his ties with Congress after a contentious 2013 confirmation hearing, submitted his resignation letter after lengthy discussions with Obama that began in October, officials said.\n\nDuring a speech at the White House, President Barack Obama called Hagel an exemplary defence secretary and his great friend who guided the military amid a time of great transition at the Pentagon.\n\n\"When it's mattered most behind closed doors, in the Oval Office, you've always given it to me straight. For that, I will always be grateful,\" Obama said, noting Hagel's willingness to take the job despite hailing from the Republican Party. Hagel called serving in the post the greatest privilege of his life.\n\nBehind the scenes, senior defence officials were cited in media reports as saying Monday that Hagel was forced to resign. They said the White House lost confidence in the former Nebraska senator to carry out his role at the Pentagon. \"He wasn't up to the job,\" one official was quoted as saying.\n\nAnother administration official said Hagel had been discussing a departure from the White House for several weeks.\n\nPresident Obama said: \"Over the past two years, Secretary Hagel helped manage an intense period of transition for the United States armed forces, including the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions, and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready. Over nearly two years, Secretary Hagel has been a steady hand, guiding our military through this transition, and helping us respond to challenges from ISIS to Ebola.\"\n\nIn October, he began speaking with the President about leaving the administration given the natural post-midterm transition time.\n\nHagel was originally brought to the job to slow the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but, as the fight against the Islamic State ramped up, he was not found fit for the post. A successor will be named in short order, an official said, but Hagel will stay in the job until his replacement is confirmed. Possible nominees include: Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, former Undersecretary of Defence Michele Flournoy (who would be the first female defence secretary) and former Deputy Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter.",

Officials said Obama wanted fresh leadership during the final two years of his administration. \"What I can tell you is there are no policy differences in the background of this decision,\" a senior US defence official said. \"The secretary is not resigning in protest and he's not being 'fired',\" the official said.

Hagel, who was the only enlisted combat veteran to serve as defence secretary, ran into a wave of opposition when Obama, a Democrat, nominated him. Republicans objected because Hagel opposed the 2007 Iraq war 'surge' of troops, which eventually helped defeat al Qaeda and other militants and opened the way for a US troop withdrawal. Hagel, who became an outspoken critic of the administration of former US president George W Bush, had also upset many in his party by endorsing Obama in his presidential race against Republican Senator John McCain in 2008.\n\nHagel was seen as poorly prepared and hesitant during his confirmation hearing, including refusing to answer 'yes' or 'no' when McCain demanded he judge whether he was wrong to oppose the surge strategy. John Boehner, who leads Republicans in the US House of Representatives, said on Monday that the selection of a replacement for Chuck Hagel as secretary of defence must be accompanied by a new look at US. military policies. \"This personnel change must be part of a larger re-thinking of our strategy to confront the threats we face abroad, especially the threat posed by the rise of ISIL,\" Boehner, the House speaker, said in a statement, signalling a potential tough tone by Republicans in Congress on the appointment.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, President Obama nominated Hagel to serve as secretary of defence. On February 12, 2013, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved Hagel's nomination by a vote of 14-11, while on February 14, 2013, Senate Republicans denied Democrats the 60 votes needed to end the debate on Hagel's nomination and proceed to a final vote, citing the need for further review. It was the first time in American history that a nominee for secretary of defence was filibustered.",

Obama went on to say a soldier \"might have been reluctant\" to ask an earlier secretary of defense a similar question. The president said this was an example of how Hagel's leadership at the Pentagon was different.\n\n\"Chuck Hagel has been no ordinary secretary of defense,\" Obama said.\n\nObama went on to explain he feels Hagel was a unique leader for the military because he was the first former enlisted soldier to hold the position. Hagel was a Vietnam veteran who earned two Purple Hearts. Obama said Hagel understood the challenges soldiers face \"like few others.\"\n\n\"He sees himself in them and they see themselves in him,\" said Obama.\n\nHagel, a former senator who was sworn in last February, is reportedly stepping down due to pressure stemming from dissatisfaction with the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the military operations against the jihadist group Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL). However, a senior administration official who spoke to Business Insider characterized Hagel's departure as a part of \"the natural post-midterms transition time.\" The official said Hagel's successor would be announced \"in short order.\"\n\nObama described Hagel as an \"exemplary\" secretary of defense. He said it was Hagel's decision to step down and characterized it as a decision made after overseeing the Pentagon through a department of \"transition.\"\n\n\"On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you Chuck,\" Obama said.\n\nHagel spoke following the president and thanked Obama for his \"generous words\" and \"friendship.\"\n\n\"I have today submitted my resignation as secretary of defense,\" said Hagel. \"It's been the greatest privilege of my life. ... I am immensely proud of what we've accomplished during this time.\"",

Mr Obama said Mr Hagel would stay on until a successor was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nHe said Mr Hagel has been candid with his advice and counsel and has \"always given it to me straight\".\n\n\"In October, secretary Hagel began speaking with the president about departing the administration ... Those conversations have been ongoing for several weeks,\" the administration official said. The White House did not give any clue who might be Mr Hagel's replacement at the Pentagon, but the New York Times -- which broke the news of his departure -- cited three candidates.\n\nFormer under-secretary of defence Michele Flournoy is said to be in the running, along with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island -- a former army officer -- and former deputy secretary of defence Ashton Carter.\n\nMr Hagel, as a Republican senator, voted in favour of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, but later became a critic of the drawn out conflict that ensued and was taken on by Mr Obama early last year to oversee the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. But his public appearances have often appeared clumsy or underwhelming as the US administration struggles to adapt to new conflicts.\n\n\"Over the past two years, secretary Hagel helped manage an intense period of transition for the US Armed Forces, including the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions, and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready,\" the senior official said.\n\n\"Over nearly two years, secretary Hagel has been a steady hand, guiding our military through this transition, and helping us respond to challenges from (IS) to Ebola.\"",

The Times first reported the resignation Monday.\n\nBut the the senior defense official denied that, calling it \"a mutual decision between Hagel and Obama.\"\n\nHagel, the 68-year-old former Republican senator from Nebraska, arrived at the Pentagon in February 2013 during a period of belt-tightening and disengagement for the military. But the new threat posed by the Islamic State has put a strain on his relationship with the rest of Obama's national security team.\n\nThe announcement comes shortly after Obama approved plans to give U.S. military commanders bigger roles alongside Afghanistan forces as they fight the Taliban following the end of the U.S. combat operation next month. The U.S. also developing plans to try to roll back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHagel got off to a rocky start even before he was sworn in. His confirmation hearings before the Senate, with former colleagues from his own Republican Party, were contentious. Although relations with Capitol Hill improved over the last two years, Hagel still struggled to articulate Pentagon policies in briefings and speeches.\n\nWhen Obama tapped Hagel in early 2013, he also considered Michele Flournoy, the former under secretary of Defense who would have been the first woman to lead the Pentagon.\n\nObama will make the personnel announcement at the White House Monday morning, according to the president's schedule, updated this morning.\n\n17 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/24/defense-secretary-hagel-resign/19479381/",

Photo: AP\n\nThe 68-year-old Vietnam war veteran joined Obama at the White House to confirm his departure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"When I asked Chuck to serve as secretary of defence we were entering a significant period of transition: the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready,\" Obama said.\n\n\"Last month, Chuck came to me to discuss the final quarter of my presidency and determined that, having guided the department through this transition, it was an appropriate time for him to to complete his service.\"\n\nWarm words ... Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, left, listens as President Barack Obama talks about Hagel's resignation during an event in the State Dining Room of the White House. Photo: AP\n\nHagel thanked Obama for his \"friendship\" and \"leadership,\" saying he believed he had put the military and the nation on a \"stronger course toward stability.\"\n\nThe White House did not say who might be Hagel's eventual replacement at the Pentagon, but in Washington three candidates are widely considered to be in the running.\n\nFormer under-secretary of defence Michele Flournoy - who would be the first woman to run the Pentagon - is touted as the most likely choice.\n\nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island - a former army airborne officer - and former deputy secretary of defence Ashton Carter are also deemed possible successors.\n\nAlthough Obama painted Hagel's departure as by mutual agreement, a senior national security staff member in Congress says that is not the case.\n\n\"Hagel quit,\" the aide said. \"Hagel found himself at odds with the administration.\"\n\nHagel's experience was similar to that of his predecessors, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, who both complained after they left office of meddling by political appointees in the White House, the aide and some lawmakers said.\n\nHagel had disagreed with the administration's approach to Syria, writing a two-page memo arguing for a more assertive stance towards President Bashar al-Assad, his aides recently disclosed.\n\nHagel, as a Republican senator, voted in favour of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, but later became a critic of the drawn out conflict that ensued and was taken on by Obama early last year to oversee the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.\n\nThe Nebraska native's experience as a non-commissioned officer who saw action in Vietnam was seen as a strength as he took on the job, but his public appearances have often appeared clumsy or underwhelming as the US administration struggles to adapt to new conflicts.\n\n\"Over the past two years, Secretary Hagel helped manage an intense period of transition for the United States Armed Forces, including the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions, and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready,\" the official said.\n\n\"Over nearly two years, Secretary Hagel has been a steady hand, guiding our military through this transition, and helping us respond to challenges from ISIL to Ebola.\"\n\nAFP",

Congressional sources said it was almost certain that would not happen until after January, when Republicans take over and will control the confirmation process.\n\nA Vietnam War veteran and longtime Republican senator, Hagel, 68, had been criticized by some for failing to clearly articulate policy, including during his confirmation hearing nearly two years ago.\n\nHe submitted his resignation letter after lengthy discussions with Obama that began in October, officials said.\n\nObama praised Hagel at a White House event called to announce his departure, saying he had always been candid with his advice and had \"always given it to me straight\".\n\nOfficials said Obama wanted fresh leadership during the final two years of his administration.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said that when Hagel was appointed, the focus for the defence department was sorting out its budget and Islamic State was not an issue. Fighting the group would be the top priority for his successor, he said.\n\nFlournoy is possible successor\n\nTop potential candidates to replace Hagel include Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of defence, who were rumoured to be contenders for Hagel's job before he was named.\n\nHagel, who was the only enlisted combat veteran to serve as defence secretary, ran into a wave of opposition when Obama, a Democrat, nominated him.\n\nRepublicans objected partly because Hagel opposed the 2007 'surge' of troops in the Iraq war, which eventually helped defeat al Qaeda and other militants and opened the way for a U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nHe was seen as poorly prepared and hesitant during his confirmation hearing, including refusing to answer 'yes' or 'no' when McCain demanded he judge whether he was wrong to oppose the surge strategy.\n\nHagel, who became an outspoken critic of the administration of President George W. Bush, had also upset many in his party by endorsing Obama in his presidential race against Republican Senator John McCain in 2008.\n\nDefence analyst Loren Thompson said Obama had seen Hagel as someone who could build bridges to the Republican Party, particularly in disputes over the massive defence budget, but Hagel's ties were not in fact strong to begin with.",

Obama thanked Hagel for his service and guidance stemming back to when the two served together in the Senate.\n\n\"You have always given it to me straight, and for that I will always be grateful,\" Obama said.\n\n[READ: Hagel Throws Money, Officers at Nuke Woes]\n\nHagel spoke afterward, thanking the president for his friendship and support. He emphasized on multiple occasions the teamwork required to lead the government's national security structure.\n\n\"It's a team effort. And that's part of the fun of it,\" Hagel said.\n\nIn a letter to service members released by the Pentagon, Hagel said he \"did not make this decision lightly.\"\n\n\"But after much discussion, the president and I agreed that now was the right time for new leadership here at the Pentagon,\" he said.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the news, citing anonymous sources who say the White House pressured Hagel to resign from his post as the country's top military official. The shakeup, reported just days before the Thanksgiving break, comes at a time when defense and security issues are dominating the White House agenda: from fighting the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, to offsetting Russian aggression in Ukraine, to stemming the spread of Ebola in Africa, to containing an expansionist China.\n\nThe announcement also follows reports of tension among Obama's top cabinet officials, particularly over the response to the Islamic State group and the ongoing negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. Hagel reportedly has said the Obama administration's plan for Syria is in danger of unraveling.\n\n\"The next couple years will demand a different kind of focus,\" the Times reported one administration official as saying.\n\nHagel, a critic of the Iraq War during his tenure as a Republican senator from Nebraska, was brought to the Pentagon to help oversee the transition out of roughly a decade of war in both Iraq and Afghanistan and spearhead the White House's Pacific rebalance strategy. He was also to oversee sweeping cultural changes first instituted by his predecessor, Leon Panetta, who lifted the bans on gays serving openly in the military and women serving in combat positions.\n\n[ALSO: Pentagon Considering U.S. Ground Mission in Iraq]\n\nInstead, Hagel found himself mired in conflicts that appeared to catch U.S. military and intelligence agencies wrong-footed. Russia invaded Ukraine early this year, occupying the Crimean peninsula, and the Islamic State group insurgency steamrolled across Iraq from Syria.\n\nHagel was left trying to publicly justify the administration's policy against any U.S. ground combat troops in either Iraq and Syria, in the face of reports that his own top advisers believed a ground component could be necessary.\n\nIt's not yet clear who will replace Hagel for the top Pentagon position. Those on the short list from the last selection process include Michele Flournoy - the former top Pentagon civilian for policy - Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Ashton Carter, who retired last year as deputy secretary of Defense.\n\nHagel will remain in office until his successor is confirmed by the Senate, The Associated Press reports.",

He was also the one Republican in the White House national security set-up.\n\nBut that may be of lesser importance than him being appointed to do one task in the Pentagon, only to find that the job description has changed fundamentally.\n\nHe was the man appointed to bring the troops home and pare back the huge defence budget. But then Islamic State came along and all the calculations changed, and Obama and his defence chief found themselves at odds.\n\nThere was a lack of clear strategy, perhaps because Obama and Hagel didn't agree on what it should be. And after mid-term political defeats, the president needs a military win. So a change at the top will be an important symbol of that determination.\n\nWhich of course leaves the question, did he jump or was he pushed? Probably a bit of both.\n\nHagel, who served as Republican senator for his home state of Nebraska for 12 years, became critical of US involvement in Iraq despite voting to authorise the war.\n\nHe replaced Leon Panetta as defence secretary in Obama's second term, taking on the task of winding down the Afghanistan war and making a military shift towards Asia.\n\nBut the future of US military policy has changed amid air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"The next couple of years will demand a different kind of focus,\" an unnamed White House official told the New York Times.\n\nUS media report there was increasing tension between Hagel and the administration over decisions in Syria and working styles, citing Hagel confidantes and senior defence officials.\n\nObama is not expected to announce a nominee to replace Hagel on Monday.

                    "body": "The news this morning that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is leaving his post as soon as President Obama can name a successor set off a round of speculation about the reasons behind the 68-year-old Republican's resignation. In a late morning announcement in the White House's state dining room in front of two dozen senior officials, Obama said that the former Nebraska senator came to him in October and said it was \"an appropriate time for him to complete his service.\" Added Obama, \"This decision did not come easily to him.\"\n\nBut multiple reports say that Hagel, a Vietnam veteran who earned two purple hearts and is the first combat veteran to hold the post, did not voluntarily step down after just 22 rocky months on the job. Rather the consensus is that the administration forced his hand. Hagel called his service as secretary \"the greatest privilege of my life.\"\n\nThe New York Times broke the news early this morning, before the formal announcement, reporting that Obama and Hagel had held a series of meetings over the last two weeks, which led the President to decide to dismiss Hagel, who took the job at a time when the military was withdrawing from Afghanistan and the Pentagon budget was shrinking. Now the US is sending nearly 3,000 troops to Iraq to help the Iraqi military fight the Islamic State, and, in Afghanistan, instead of sticking to a plan that had the 9,800 American troops there training Afghan forces and tracking down remaining Al Qaeda supporters, the Defense Department is expanding the troops' role for at least a year to include direct combat.\n\n\"The next couple of years will demand a different kind of focus,\" one administration official told the Times. This source said the two men came to a joint decision that it was time for Hagel to go. But Hagel aides had told the Times over the past couple of weeks that the Secretary had intended to serve a full four years.\n\nAn administration official also told The Washington Post that it was the president who initiated the discussions with Hagel that led to the resignation. NBCNews.com quoted senior defense officials who said that the resignation was definitely forced. The White House had lost confidence in the secretary, according to this report. \"He wasn't up to the job,\" one official told NBC.\n\nHagel had had a tough time since his shaky confirmation hearings, which resulted in a narrow yes vote, with only four members of his party siding with him, even though he was the only Republican to serve in the cabinet.\n\nHagel came to the post in part through his friendship with Obama when the two then-senators found that they both opposed the Iraq war. They traveled overseas together, and in his speech, Obama credited Hagel with accompanying him to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nDespite their apparent friendship, Hagel never penetrated Obama's inner circle of advisers and stayed away from center stage, letting the limelight shine on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey. Though the Times points out that after his more extroverted predecessor Robert M. Gates, who wrote a memoir of his time as Secretary, Hagel was the kind of low-key secretary Obama wanted.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue",

She is also a favourite of Hillary Clinton and could remain in post if Mrs Clinton wins the White House in 2016.\n\nOther possibilities include Robert Work, Mr Hagel's deputy, who served with the Marines for 27 years and Jeh Johnson, the current secretary of homeland security.\n\nMr Obama paid generous tribute to Mr Hagel's ability to empathise with rank-and-file soldiers, also thanking him personally for the support he had provided \"a green-behind-the-ears freshman senator\" when they were both sitting on the Senate foreign relations committee.\n\nBarry Pavel, a former senior defence department official now with the Atlantic Council, of which Mr Hagel is a former chairman, said that mounting number of international crises had simply left the decorated soldier unsuited to the role.\n\n\"The enormous set of attributes that made Senator Hagel attractive to the President at the time are somewhat less important now because conditions have changed so much,\" Mr Pavel said. \"The world has rebooted and the White House is rebooting in response.\"\n\nUS officials told the New York Times that Mr Obama made the decision to ask his defence chief to step down last Friday, but had been mulling the issue for weeks.\n\nBoth of Mr Obama's previous defence chiefs - Leon Panetta and Robert Gates - went on to criticise the President after they left office, but Mr Hagel pledged that he would \"continue to support\" the administration.\n\nMr Hagel was considered a moderate Republican during his time in the Senate and was respected by Democrats after speaking out against George W Bush's \"surge\" of US forces into Iraq in 2007.\n\nHowever, his tenure as secretary of defence was shaky from the start. During a confirmation hearing in front of his fellow senators, Mr Hagel blundered through several answers, causing nervousness in the White House.\n\nMr Obama had reportedly grown convinced that Mr Hagel was not up to the task of managing what looks likely to be a years-long fight against Isilin the Middle East.\n\nThe defence chief also struggled to break through Mr Obama's closely knit circle of national security aides at the White House. He was said to be quiet in cabinet meetings and to have few ideas to present to Mr Obama about how to handle the chaos in the Middle East.\n\nMr Hagel volunteered for the infantry during the Vietnam War and was wounded twice while fighting alongside his brother, Tom. The pair earned five Purple Hearts during their service.\n\nUnlike John Kerry, the US secretary of state, Mr Hagel was never an officer and left the military as a sergeant. His gruff manner earned him the respect of many enlisted troops when he took over at the Pentagon.\n\nBut he was a less adept bureaucratic infighter than his predecessor, Leon Panetta. While the gregarious Mr Panetta had several senior roles in the White House during his career, Mr Hagel was often outmaneuvered by others inside the US government.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel resigned Monday after a two-year tenure that drew sharp criticism for the handling of the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and what Obama administration officials said was a loss of confidence in the only Republican in the Cabinet.\n\nIn a brief White House announcement that carried the pall of a political funeral, President Obama said it was \"an appropriate time\" for Hagel to resign. He thanked his former Senate Foreign Relations Committee colleague for being an exemplary secretary of defense.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nNeither Obama nor Hagel, who described running the Department of Defense as \"the greatest privilege of my life,\" addressed the reasons for the premature departure. Hagel told Pentagon employees in a subsequent message that \"I did not make this decision lightly.\"\n\nBut it was clear from senior administration officials and close observers that the pair, despite their decade-long friendship, reached an impasse that could not be bridged.\n\n\"Apparently it got to the point [where] either President Obama didn't feel that Secretary Hagel was carrying out his desires or wishes, or Secretary Hagel came to believe his own views were growing pretty disparate from the president,\" said William S. Cohen, who served as secretary of defense from 1997 to 2001.\n\nContinue reading it below\n\nCohen, a former Republican senator from Maine, said he believes the war against the Islamic State, in which Obama has publicly ruled out the use of American combat troops, was a key turning point.\n\nTop military officers -- including General Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- have been more vocal about the potential need for more American ground troops. Although Obama has increased the number of military advisers in Iraq, he is still reluctant to establish a robust US military presence in a country he has vowed to leave.\n\n\"I think there was a growing disparity between what the Pentagon believes is necessary to carry out a successful mission and the president's desire,\" Cohen said in an interview, recalling friction about perceived White House micro-management with Obama's previous two secretaries of defense, Robert M. Gates and Leon Panetta, both of whom revealed their complaints in books.\n\nThe focus on a replacement quickly trained on several potential contenders, including two with New England ties: Ashton B. Carter, a longtime Harvard academic and Pentagon second-in-command who was previously in the running for the top job, and Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and a West Point graduate.\n\nReed answered with an emphatic \"no\" when asked Monday whether he is interested in becoming defense secretary.\n\n\"I have an extraordinary privilege of representing the people of Rhode Island,\" Reed said after a talk he delivered at Harvard Law School.\n\nCarter, who stepped down as deputy secretary of defense in December and had previously been a faculty member at the Harvard Kennedy School on and off for two decades, did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nAlso considered a top candidate is Michele Flournoy, a close Obama confidante who served as the Pentagon's policy chief in the first term and, if confirmed, would be the first woman to hold the job. Some analysts also floated the name of Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee who is set to retire.\n\nObama \"has some strong options for the final quarter of the administration,\" James N. Miller, who served in the same Pentagon post as Flournoy until January of this year and is now a senior fellow at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said in an interview. \"That is not always the case.\"\n\nHagel is planning to remain at his post until his successor is nominated and confirmed by the Senate, a process that could take weeks if not months.\n\nThe shake-up comes as the Pentagon is confronting a series of major challenges, including the nearly four-month air campaign against the Islamic State, the response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Russia's military foray into Ukraine, and a host of budget shortfalls. On Monday, the Pentagon announced nine more airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria and 15 airstrikes across Iraq.\n\nThe announcement also came as Secretary of State John F. Kerry revealed a seven-month extension of negotiations with Iran about curbing its nuclear program.\n\n\"I know him and love him as a friend,\" Kerry, a fellow Vietnam veteran, said of Hagel in remarks to reporters in Vienna. \"I'm totally beyond -- I'm very, very sorry he has made the decision to leave.\"\n\nIn a message to the troops and civilian Pentagon workers, Hagel, 68, said he was proud of his accomplishments, citing efforts to prepare the government of Afghanistan to take over the fight against the Taliban and action against the Islamic State that has \"blunted the momentum of this barbaric enemy.\"\n\nBut it was clear that Hagel struggled to get his footing at the Pentagon and was widely considered ill-equipped to manage all the challenges.\n\n\"Hagel's biggest problem was that he was temperamentally ill-suited to running a big and politically sensitive bureaucracy,\" said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant with close ties to the Pentagon leadership. \"You could see that from the beginning of his confirmation hearings when he did not answer questions well.\"\n\nThompson also said some events quickly spun out of control, such as Russia's incursion into Ukraine.\n\nNot everyone found fault with Hagel. Republicans, including some who voted against his confirmation two years ago, rushed to his defense.\n\n\"I know that Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision-making process,\" Senator John McCain of Arizona, who in January will become chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. He cited \"excessive micro-management\" from the White House as a hindrance to top military officials doing their jobs.\n\nHagel, who was the second enlisted soldier in modern times to become secretary of defense and the first Vietnam veteran, also drew especially high marks for his steadfast support for the troops and veterans, including holding regular closed-door meetings with rank and file soldiers and their families.\n\n\"The veterans community has had no stronger advocate in Washington than Secretary Hagel,\" said Paul Rieckhoff, chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.\n\nThe premature departure of Hagel was clearly difficult for Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, who both served with Hagel on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nObama on Monday called Hagel a \"great friend of mine\" whom he first got to know a decade ago when, as he put it, the president was a \"green-behind-the-ears freshman senator.\"\n\n\"When it's mattered most behind closed doors, in the Oval Office,\" Obama told Hagel, \"you've always given it to me straight.\"\n\nRelated coverage:\n\n* Senator Jack Reed of R.I. not interested in defense secretary post\n\n* Hagel orders top-to-bottom changes in nuke force\n\n* Hagel considering new military-wide Ebola policy\n\n* Hagel defends Bergdahl swap in testimony\n\nBrian MacQuarrie of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

He's been in the dirt. He's been in the mud,\" Mr Obama said. \"And that has established a special bond. He sees himself in them. They see themselves in him.\"\n\nMr Hagel spoke for just over five minutes. He received about 30 seconds of applause from the administration officials on hand.\n\nAfter finishing his remarks, President Obama hugged Mr Hagel, who then turned towards the audience and bowed. Mr Hagel arrived at the Pentagon in February 2013 during a period of belt-tightening and disengagement for the military, but ended up leading new fights against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, National Security Adviser Susan Rice; General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Attorney General Eric Holder were among officials who attended the event.\n\nLater, White House officials told reporters that Mr Hagel began speaking with President Obama about leaving in early October.\n\nWhile discussing Mr Hagel's resignation, Mr Obama also asked other top administration officials whether they would stay on for the last two years of his presidency, the officials said.\n\nThe US media reported that Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, a former under secretary of Defence for policy, might replace Mr Hagel.\n\nShe was runner-up for the slot when Mr Obama selected Mr Hagel in early 2013.\n\nOther possible candidates include Senator Jack Reed, a defence specialist and a former officer with the Army's 82nd Airborne; and Ashton B. Carter, a former deputy secretary of Defence.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama called Chuck Hagel \"no ordinary secretary of defense\" as he announced Hagel's resignation Monday, opening the way for a new Pentagon leader to confront evolving national security challenges in the final two years of Obama's presidency.\n\nHagel has been under pressure from the White House to step down, and White House officials have suggested that Obama sought new leadership in the U.S. campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHagel, an enlisted soldier during the Vietnam War who rose to the rank of sergeant, developed a closeness with servicemen and women, Obama said in formal remarks from the White House.\n\n\"He understands our men and women like few others because he stood where they stood,\" Obama said, standing beside the outgoing secretary and Vice President Joe Biden. \"He's been in the dirt, and he's been in the mud. And that's established a special bond.\"\n\nHagel's resignation comes less than two months after he penned a blunt memo to National Security Adviser Susan Rice pointing out what he saw as problems in the administration's policy toward Syria. The memo advised a sharper approach to dealing with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who remains in power as the U.S. focuses on removing the Islamic State from Syria and Iraq.\n\nObama has called on Assad to step down, but he has not authorized using military force, including a proposed proxy army of moderate rebels, to remove the Syrian leader.\n\nHagel, 68, never mentioned the disagreement publicly and evaded questions about the rift.\n\nOn Monday, Obama said it was \"an appropriate time for him to complete his service.\" He also thanked Hagel, a former Republican senator, for serving with \"class and integrity\" and for offering candid advice.\n\n\"When I nominated you for this position, you said that you'd always give me your honest advice and informed counsel. You have,\" Obama said. \"Behind closed doors, in the Oval Office, you've always given it to me straight, and for that I will always be grateful.\"\n\nIn brief remarks following the president's announcement, Hagel thanked Obama and said he believed that the administration has set the nation on a \"stronger course to security, stability and prosperity.\"\n\nThe secretary, who at times appeared to be out of the White House inner circle, noted \"it is a team effort. And that's part of the fun of it, to help build teams and to work together to make things happen for the good of the country and make a better world,\" he noted.\n\nHagel said he will stay on until his successor is confirmed. He first raised the idea of leaving the administration after the midterm elections last month with Obama, a senior administration official said.\n\nHagel, who took office in February 2013, is the only Republican in the upper echelon of Obama's circle of advisers. He and Obama forged a friendship in the Senate, where both were critics of the war in Iraq.\n\nAfter winning a bitter Senate confirmation battle, Hagel took over the Pentagon at a time it was facing a massive retrenchment with the end of expensive ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also had to absorb $47 billion in budget cuts mandated by Congress that predecessors said would gut the force.\n\nHe helped to manage the drawdown of the war in Afghanistan for the U.S. military, with a focus on preparing the fighting force for future missions and cutting some areas of military spending.\n\nBut he never could generate the spotlight in the way of his predecessors: Leon Panetta, who had served as CIA director and presided over the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, or Robert Gates, Obama's first defense secretary, who had also headed the CIA.\n\nHagel never seemed to show the brash personality that earned him maverick status as a Republican senator from Nebraska who took controversial positions and issued blunt assessments, no matter the consequences. At congressional hearings on the Islamic State, Hagel often took a backseat to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey.\n\nObama has reportedly been looking at several candidates to run the Pentagon during his final two years in office. A former military adviser, Michele Flournoy, is said to be one of those under consideration.\n\nThe name of Ashton Carter, a former Defense Department official who was on the short list for the job the last time around, has also been floated.",

She is also a favourite of Hillary Clinton and could remain in post if Mrs Clinton wins the White House in 2016.\n\nOther possibilities include Robert Work, Mr Hagel's deputy, who served with the Marines for 27 years and Jeh Johnson, the current secretary of homeland security.\n\nMr Obama paid generous tribute to Mr Hagel's ability to empathise with rank-and-file soldiers, also thanking him personally for the support he had provided \"a green-behind-the-ears freshman senator\" when they were both sitting on the Senate foreign relations committee.\n\nBarry Pavel, a former senior defence department official now with the Atlantic Council, of which Mr Hagel is a former chairman, said that mounting number of international crises had simply left the decorated soldier unsuited to the role.\n\n\"The enormous set of attributes that made Senator Hagel attractive to the President at the time are somewhat less important now because conditions have changed so much,\" Mr Pavel said. \"The world has rebooted and the White House is rebooting in response.\"\n\nUS officials told the 'New York Times' that Mr Obama made the decision to ask his defence chief to step down last Friday, but had been mulling the issue for weeks.\n\nBoth of Mr Obama's previous defence chiefs - Leon Panetta and Robert Gates - went on to criticise the President after they left office, but Mr Hagel pledged that he would \"continue to support\" the administration.\n\nMr Hagel was considered a moderate Republican during his time in the Senate and was respected by Democrats after speaking out against George W Bush's \"surge\" of US forces into Iraq in 2007.\n\nHowever, his tenure as secretary of defence was shaky from the start. During a confirmation hearing in front of his fellow senators, Mr Hagel blundered through several answers, causing nervousness in the White House. Mr Obama had reportedly grown convinced that Mr Hagel was not up to the task of managing what looks likely to be a years-long fight against Isil in the Middle East.\n\nThe defence chief also struggled to break through Mr Obama's closely-knit circle of national security aides at the White House. He was said to be quiet in cabinet meetings and to have few ideas to present to Mr Obama about how to handle the chaos in the Middle East. Mr Hagel volunteered for the infantry during the Vietnam War and was wounded twice while fighting alongside his brother, Tom. The pair earned five Purple Hearts during their service.\n\nUnlike John Kerry, the US secretary of state, Mr Hagel was never an officer and left the military as a sergeant. His gruff manner earned him the respect of many enlisted troops when he took over at the Pentagon.\n\nBut he was a less adept bureaucratic infighter than his predecessor, Leon Panetta. While the gregarious Mr Panetta had several senior roles in the White House during his career, Mr Hagel was often outmanoeuvred by others inside the US government. (\u00a9 Daily Telegraph, London)",

The Times adds:\n\n\"The officials described Mr. Obama's decision to remove Mr. Hagel, 68, as a recognition that the threat from the Islamic State would require a different kind of skills than those that Mr. Hagel was brought on to employ. A Republican with military experience who was skeptical about the Iraq war, Mr. Hagel came in to manage the Afghanistan combat withdrawal and the shrinking Pentagon budget in the era of budget sequestration.\n\n\"But now 'the next couple of years will demand a different kind of focus,' one administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. He insisted that Mr. Hagel was not fired, saying that he initiated discussions about his future two weeks ago with the president, and that the two men mutually agreed that it was time for him to leave.\"\n\nThe news comes just as American troops are completing their combat role in Afghanistan and just as the administration announced a new war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nBack in October, there were reports from CNN and the New York Times that described a memo written by Hagel in which he criticized the Obama administration's policy toward Syria.\n\nCiting an unnamed senior U.S. official, CNN reported that Hagel told National Security Advisor Susan Rice that \"we need to have a sharper view of what to do about the Assad regime.\"\n\nPublicly, Hagel seemed in lock step with the Obama administration. During congressional testimony earlier this month, Hagel said the administration's strategy against the Islamic State was making progress.\n\nBut he was sober about the mission to equip and train Syrian rebels.\n\n\"We know the opposition will continue to face intense pressure in a multifront battle space, and we are considering options for how U.S. and coalition forces can further support these forces once they are trained and equipped,\" Hagel said. \"Our strategy in Syria will demand time, patience, and perseverance to deliver results. We cannot accomplish our objectives in Syria all at once.\"\n\nUpdate at 10:23 a.m. ET. A Surprise:\n\n\"Hagel was not seen as a very forceful secretary of defense,\" NPR's Tom Bowman tells Morning Edition. \"We're told that in cabinet meetings he really didn't say that much, but again this does come as a surprise that he's leaving this early.\"\n\nTom says Hagel disagreed with the White House because he wanted to take a harder line against the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria. But the White House was resistant to that kind of strategy.\n\nTom says there had been whispers that Hagel may not stay through the remainder of Obama's second term, but this sudden announcement comes as a surprise.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama called Chuck Hagel \"no ordinary secretary of defense\" as he announced Hagel's resignation Monday, opening the way for a new Pentagon leader to confront evolving national security challenges in the final two years of Obama's presidency.\n\nHagel has been under pressure from the White House to step down, and White House officials have suggested that Obama sought new leadership in the U.S. campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.\n\nHagel, an enlisted soldier during the Vietnam War who rose to the rank of sergeant, developed a closeness with servicemen and -women, Obama said in formal remarks from the White House.\n\n\"He understands our men and women like few others because he stood where they stood,\" Obama said, standing beside the outgoing secretary and Vice President Biden. \"He's been in the dirt, and he's been in the mud. And that's established a special bond.\"\n\nHagel's resignation comes less than two months after he penned a blunt memo to national security adviser Susan Rice pointing out what he saw as problems in the administration's policy toward Syria.\n\nThe memo advised a sharper approach to dealing with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who remains in power as the U.S. focuses on removing the Islamic State from Syria and Iraq.\n\nObama has called on Assad to step down, but he has not authorized using military force, including a proposed proxy army of moderate rebels, to remove the Syrian leader.\n\nHagel, 68, never mentioned the disagreement publicly and evaded questions about the rift.\n\nOn Monday, Obama said it was \"an appropriate time for him to complete his service.\" He also thanked Hagel, a former Republican senator, for serving with \"class and integrity\" and offering candid advice.\n\n\"When I nominated you for this position, you said that you'd always give me your honest advice and informed counsel. You have,\" Obama said. \"When it's matter most, behind closed doors, in the Oval Office, you've always given it to me straight, and for that I will always be grateful.\"\n\nIn brief remarks following the president's announcement, Hagel thanked Obama and said he believed that the administration has set the nation on a \"stronger course to security, stability and prosperity.\"\n\nThe secretary, who at times appeared to be out of the White House inner circle, noted \"it is a team effort. And that's part of the fun of it, to help build teams and to work together to make things happen for the good of the country and make a better world,\" he noted. \"For all of that, I am immensely grateful.\"\n\nHagel said he will stay on until his successor is confirmed. He first raised the idea of leaving the administration after the midterm elections last month with Obama, a senior administration official said.\n\nHagel, who took office in February 2013, is the only Republican in the upper echelon of Obama's circle of advisers. He and Obama forged a friendship in the Senate, where both were critics of the war in Iraq.\n\nAfter winning a bitter Senate confirmation battle, Hagel took over the Pentagon at a time it was facing a massive retrenchment with the end of expensive ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also had to absorb $47 billion in budget cuts mandated by Congress that predecessors said would gut the force.\n\nHe helped to manage the drawdown of the war in Afghanistan for the U.S. military, with a focus on preparing the fighting force for future missions and cutting some areas of military spending.\n\nBut he never could generate the spotlight in the way of his predecessors: Leon Panetta, who had served as CIA director and presided over the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, or Robert M. Gates, Obama's first defense secretary, who had also headed the CIA.\n\nHagel never seemed to show the brash personality that earned him maverick status as a Republican senator from Nebraska who took controversial positions and issued blunt assessments, no matter the consequences. At congressional hearings on the Islamic State, Hagel often took a backseat to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey.\n\nObama has reportedly been looking at several candidates to run the Pentagon during his final two years in office. A former military adviser, Michele Flournoy, is said to be one of those under consideration.\n\nThe name of Ashton Carter, a former Defense Department official who was on the short list for the job the last time around, has also been floated.\n\nAnother name mentioned was Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, poised to become the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee in January, but his spokesman said Reed isn't interested in the job.",

He submitted his resignation letter after lengthy discussions with Obama that began in October, officials said.\n\n\"It's been the greatest privilege of my life to lead, and most important, to serve with the men and women of the Defence Department and support their families. I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished during this time,\" Hagel said.\n\nHe will remaim in his post untill his successor is appointed by the US Senate.\n\nAl Jazeera's Patty Culhane, reporting from Washington, said the move suggests Obama is paying heed to criticism over the handling of the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL) threat in the Middle East.\n\n\"Officials are saying that the Pentagon needs an approach different from the one Hagel would bring\" if he had stayed, our correspondent said, adding that the Pentagon chief was seen as \"timid and a bit confused\".\n\nHagel had raised questions about Obama's strategy towards Syria in a two-page internal policy memo he wrote that leaked. In it, he warned that Obama's policy was in jeopardy due to its failure to clarify its intentions towards Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nObama has insisted that the United States can go after ISIL fighters without addressing Assad, who the United States would like to leave power.\n\nOfficials said Obama wanted fresh leadership during the final two years of his administration.\n\n\"What I can tell you is there are no policy differences in the background of this decision,\" a senior US defence official cited by Reuters said.\n\n\"The secretary is not resigning in protest and he's not being 'fired',\" the official said.\n\nTop potential candidates to replace Hagel include Michele Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of defence, who were rumoured to be contenders for Hagel's job before he was named.\n\nSenator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, is another possible contender.",

Obama said Hagel's acceptance of his offer to serve as defense chief, despite coming from a different party, sent a \"powerful message\" that when it comes to national security, partisan interests are put behind.\n\nObama did not give a clearer reason for Hagel's departure. And Hagel also said only, \"After much discussion, the president and I agreed that now was the right time for new leadership here at the Pentagon.\"\n\nBut news reports said that he has been pressured to step down.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Obama's decision to let Hagel go is a recognition that the threat from the Islamic State would require a different set of skills than those Hagel possesses. He was initially brought on in order to manage the withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan and a shrinking defense budget.\n\nHagel had trouble penetrating the tight team of former campaign aides and advisers who form Obama's closely knit set of loyalists. He struggled to fit in with Obama's inner circle and was viewed as never gaining traction in the administration, the report said.\n\nAccording to the paper, officials have already been speculating over who will succeed Hagel. Candidates include Michele Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense; Senator Jack Reed (D-RI); and Ashton B. Carter, a former deputy secretary of defense. (Yonhap)",

For that, Obama said, he is \"extraordinarily lucky and grateful.\"\n\n\"When I asked Chuck to serve as secretary of defense, we were entering a significant period of transition,\" Obama said.\n\nThat transition included the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready.\n\nLast month, Obama said, Hagel came to him to discuss the final quarter of his presidency. It was then that Hagel initially determined that, having guided the department through this transition, it was an appropriate time for him to complete his service, the president added.\n\n\"Over nearly two years, Chuck has been an exemplary defense secretary,\" Obama said, crediting Hagel for providing a steady hand during the modernization of the administration's strategy and budget to meet long-term threats, while still responding to immediate challenges such as ISIL and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nHagel said he is \"immensely proud\" of what the department has accomplished during his tenure.\n\n\"I believe we have set not only this department, the Department of Defense, but the nation on a stronger course toward security, stability and prosperity,\" the secretary said.\n\nHagel called his opportunity to serve as defense secretary the \"greatest privilege of my life.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Hagel said, \"I will stay on this job and work just as hard as I have over the last couple of years, every day, every moment, until my successor is confirmed by the United States Senate.\"\n\nThe United States of America can proudly claim the strongest military the world has ever known, Obama said.\n\n\"That's the result of the investments made over many decades, the blood and treasure and sacrifices of many generations,\" he said. \"It's the result of the character and wisdom of those who lead them as well, including a young Army sergeant in Vietnam who rose to serve as our nation's 24th secretary of defense.\"",

                    "body": "Chuck Hagel, the US secretary of defence, is resigning after President Barack Obama lost faith in his ability to lead the Pentagon during America's struggle with the Islamic State.\n\nMr Obama will announce the surprise resignation from the White House at 11.10am EST (4.10pm GMT), after the news was first reported in the New York Times. He is expected to remain in his post until a successor is confirmed.\n\nThe 68-year-old Mr Hagel is a combat veteran of the Vietnam war and was a Republican senator before Mr Obama asked him to join his cabinet less than two years ago to help cut defence spending and wind down the war in Afghanistan.\n\nInstead, Mr Hagel's tenure has been beset by international crises from the advance of jihadists in Iraq and Syria to Russia's annexation of Crimea and ongoing interference in Ukraine.\n\nUS officials told the New York Times that Mr Obama made the decision to ask his defence chief to step down last Friday but had been mulling the issue for weeks.\n\nIt is not immediately clear who will replace Mr Hagel as the fourth secretary of defence during Mr Obama's six years in office, an unusually high rate of turnover. One possibility is Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, a former senior defence official, who would be the first women to lead the Pentagon.\n\nBoth of Mr Obama's previous defence chiefs - Leon Panetta and Robert Gates - have gone on to criticise the President after they left office.\n\nMr Hagel was considered a moderate Republican during his time in the Senate and was respected by Democrats after speaking out against George W Bush's \"surge\" of US forces into Iraq in 2007.\n\nHowever, his tenure as secretary of defence was shaky from its first days. During a confirmation hearing in front of his fellow senators, Mr Hagel flubbed several answers, causing nervousness in the White House.\n\nMr Obama has reportedly grown convinced that Mr Hagel was not up to the task of managing what looks likely to be a years-long struggle against ISIL in the Middle East.\n\nThe defence chief also struggled to break through Mr Obama's closely-knit circle of national security aides at the White House. He was said to be quiet in cabinet meetings and to have few ideas to present to Mr Obama about how to handle the chaos in the Middle East.\n\nMr Hagel volunteered for the infantry during the Vietnam War and was wounded twice while fighting alongside his brother, Tom. The pair earned five Purple Hearts during their service.\n\nUnlike John Kerry, the US secretary of state, Mr Hagel was never an officer and left the military as a sergeant. His gruff manner earned him the respect of many enlisted troops when he took over at the Pentagon.\n\nBut he was a less adept bureaucratic infighter than his predecessor, Leon Panetta. While the gregarious Mr Panetta had several senior roles in the White House during his career, Mr Hagel was often outmaneuvered by others inside the US government.\n\nMr Hagel was asked last week on the Charlie Rose show if he was concerned that his job might be at risk. He replied: \"I don't get up in the morning and worry about my job. It's not unusual by the way, to change teams at different times.\"\n\nEven as all eyes in Washington were on the White House Rose Garden, where Mr Obama will make his announcement, US fighter jets were still in action over the Middle East. Coalition aircraft carried out nine strikes in Syria and 15 more in Iraq over the weekend, according to US Central Command.\n\nMore to follow",

Mr Hagel's experience as a non-commissioned officer who saw action in Vietnam was seen as a strength as he took on the job, but his public appearances have often appeared clumsy or underwhelming as the US administration struggles to adapt to new conflicts.\n\n\"Over the past two years, Secretary Hagel helped manage an intense period of transition for the United States Armed Forces, including the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions, and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready,\" the official said.\n\n\"Over nearly two years, Secretary Hagel has been a steady hand, guiding our military through this transition, and helping us respond to challenges from Isil (Islamic State) to Ebola.\"",

                    "body": "Chuck Hagel, president Barack Obama's defence secretary, has stood down after less than two years in the job in a sign of increased unease at the White House on tackling growing international crises.\n\nMr Hagel was reported to have resigned under pressure from an administration eager to project more assertive responses. He is the first member of Mr Obama's cabinet team to stand aside since the heavy midterm election losses for the Democratic Party.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation, Mr Obama described Mr Hagel, the only Republican in his cabinet, as \"an exemplary defence secretary\" who had overseen major changes in the American defence forces.\n\nThe display of mutual praise from Mr Obama and Mr Hagel at the public announcement of his unexpected resignation stands in contrast to the behind-the-scenes tensions and the president's public differences with a defence secretary who was often criticised for being too indecisive.\n\nThe laid-back former Republican senator from Nebraska was seen as being ill-equipped to tackle the militant Muslim group Islamic State, given his opposition to the Iraq war and his stewardship of the withdrawal of US troops in Afghanistan and the sharp reduction in defence spending.\n\nMr Obama and Mr Hagel appeared divided on the threat posed by IS. Months after the president dismissed the radical fighters as \"jayvees\" or junior varsity players against US professionals, the defence secretary said that IS had grown into something more than \"just a terrorist group\".\n\nWhite House officials were said to have been angered by a recent letter that Mr Hagel sent national security adviser Susan Rice, in which he said that Mr Obama needed to articulate a clearer view on the administration's approach to dealing with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.\n\nWhile Mr Obama ruled out sending ground combat troops to fight IS in his September 2014 strategy to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" the group, Mr Hagel said this month that combat troop deployments may have to be considered if recommended by US military chiefs.\n\nMr Hagel struggled to secure support in Congress for Mr Obama's policies, and the president was hurt by the message in the November 4th elections that he was failing to cope with immigrants at the Mexican border, the spread of Ebola and IS, and tensions with Russia.\n\n\"It was what I call a fear and loathing election,\" said Gordon Adams, a professor of international relations at American University in Washington.\n\n\"It could be that one of the results of that was for the president to look more decisive, more managerial with respect to the capabilities of the defence department. And for that, the secretary had to go.\"\n\nA veteran who still carries shrapnel from his time as an army sergeant in Vietnam, Mr Hagel (68) was the first enlisted soldier to serve as secretary for defence. He got the job despite an unconvincing performance at a Senate confirmation hearing in January 2013, where his past policy positions was berated by a fellow Republican, John McCain.\n\nA critic of Mr Obama's foreign policy, Mr McCain will as chairman of the Senate armed services committee play a pivotal role in deciding whether the president chooses a suitable replacement.\n\nMr Hagel will remain on until his successor is approved by Congress. Names linked to the job include Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, a former under-secretary for policy from 2009 to 2012; and Ashton Carter, who was No 2 at the Pentagon from 2011 to 2013.",

Believe me, he was up to the job,\" he said.\n\nMcCain said the administration had \"no strategy\" to fight the IS extremists and that Hagel had never been allowed into an inner circle making decisions.\n\nHagel had disagreed with the administration's approach to Syria, writing a two-page memo arguing for a more assertive stance towards President Bashar al-Assad, his aides recently disclosed.\n\nApart from the air war against the IS group, the White House has also come under criticism for its plans in Afghanistan, with some Republicans saying US troops should stay in the country longer, beyond the end of Obama's term in two years.\n\njca-ddl/dc\n\nTell us what you think about this article Like dislike 0 people liked / 0 people disliked it Share this article More on this topic\n\nExploding poop topples China building\n\nPublished: 24 Nov 2014 Total views: 4,242\n\nIndian police recover bodies at wanted guru's ashram\n\nPublished: 19 Nov 2014 Total views: 1,629\n\nLove in the time of Ebola: teen pregnancy and violence\n\nPublished: 18 Nov 2014 Total views: 442\n\nBritain 'not optimistic' on Iran nuclear talks\n\nPublished: 20 Nov 2014 Total views: 561\n\nGunmen execute 28 on Kenya bus near Somalia border: police\n\nPublished: 22 Nov 2014 Total views: 708\n\nFacebook 'newspaper' spells trouble for media\n\nPublished: 23 Nov 2014 Total views: 6,113\n\nGerman finance minister wants EU to have budget veto powers\n\nPublished: 23 Nov 2014 Total views: 463\n\nStorm in a marmalade jar over 'Paddington' sex content\n\nPublished: 19 Nov 2014 Total views: 484\n\nPhone taps embarrass French clubs in match-fixing\n\nPublished: 19 Nov 2014 Total views: 782\n\nGreen Climate Fund hopes to raise billions in Berlin\n\nPublished: 20 Nov 2014 Total views: 346\n\nObama orders review of US policy on hostages\n\nPublished: 18 Nov 2014 Total views: 821\n\nIran refuses to give ground on key Arak reactor\n\nPublished: 20 Nov 2014 Total views: 444\n\nOther stories in this category * US jury reaches decision in Ferguson police ... * Pentagon chief Hagel out as IS war heats up * US stocks hit new highs * US jury reaches decision in Ferguson police ... * Child trafficking on the rise: UN * Teenage Jeff Koons tells AFP he 'knew nothing' ...

                    "body": "Also cited war on terror blowback, criticized US foreign policy\n\nChuck Hagel has been fired by Obama from his position as Defense Secretary. Hagel, a former GOP Senator, was appointed by Obama in early 2013 and therefore was scheduled to serve for the entirety of Obama's second term.\n\nPrior to his appointment, Hagel is said to have visited the White House in 2009, and personally warned Obama that he should look out for rogue elements within the Pentagon that were leading a 'new world order'.\n\nThis was not reported on some internet conspiracy forum, it was a leading report published shortly before Hagel's appointment, by Bob Woodward, an award winning journalist and associate editor with The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to an account that Hagel gave, he told Obama: \"We are at a time where there is a new world order.\"\n\n\"We don't control it. You must question everything, every assumption, everything they\" -- the military and diplomats -- \"tell you. Any assumption 10 years old is out of date. You need to question our role. You need to question the military. You need to question what are we using the military for.\" Hagel is said to have told the President.\n\nThe Post report also stated that Hagel warned Obama about becoming \"bogged down\" in the ongoing war in Afghanistan, saying it would define Obama's first term. Hagel reportedly later privately questioned the wisdom of sending additional troops to join the conflict.\n\n\"If Hagel is confirmed, as appears likely, he and the president will have a large task in navigating this new world order.\" The Post report concluded at the time.\n\nIt remains to be discovered as to whether or not Hagel attempted to oust the rogue elements within the military industrial complex. The last straw for Hagel, though, may have been comments he made last week during a sit down interview with Charlie Rose at the Pentagon.\n\nDuring the exchange, Hagel expressed a belief that US military action against ISIS was \"indirectly benefiting\" the Syrian President Bashar Assad, comments that were sure to have been unwelcome by the powers that be, given its push for airstrikes against the Syrian government last year.\n\nHagel also said that \"The world is damn dangerous,\" adding that the US military is unprepared.\n\nHagel criticized defense budget cuts and stated outright \"We won't have the readiness. We won't have the capability. We won't have long-term investments that this institution requires to stay ahead of everybody else, as we have since World War II, with the technological edge, with the ability to continue to recruit and retain the best people.\"\n\nHagel was also critical of US foreign policy, noting that \"policies are predicated on historical knowledge and cultural awareness and all that goes into that. Have we made mistakes over a series of many years? Yeah, I think we have. I think anybody would agree to that.\"\n\nIn short, Hagel is no longer in a job because he alluded to rogue globalist elements within the US military, criticized the long imperial march to war, and admitted to detrimental blowback in the 'war on terror'. Yeah, that'll do it.",

                    "body": "While there had been chatter for a while of tensions between Mr Hagel - a former Republican Senator from Nebraska - and the White House, his ousting after barely two years caught many in Washington off guard and will unsettle America's allies. He will remain in the job until a successor is found.\n\nThat process is likely to be fraught. Whomever is chosen by Mr Obama to take Mr Hagel's place - and there is talk of his favouring former under-secretary of defence Michele Flournoy - ensuring that they win confirmation in a Senate that after January will have a Republican majority will not be simple. There seemed little doubt that Mr Hagel, 68, was bowing out under pressure, even though officials said the decision had been reached by \"mutual\" agreement. Discussions about his position had been ongoing for some weeks. He submitted his resignation on Monday morning and Mr Obama quickly accepted it.\n\nMr Hagel, who was the first enlisted soldier to serve as Secretary of Defence and a veteran of the Vietnam war, was popular with the ranks. He was thanked fulsomely by Mr Obama at a White House ceremony confirming the reshuffle also attended by Vice-President Joe Biden.\n\nMr Hagel is the first senior member to leave the cabinet since the Republican sweep in midterm elections on 4 November. Mr Obama, who on several fronts has appeared to take on a more assertive pose since those elections, called him an \"exemplary defence secretary\" who has \"devoted himself to our national security and our men and women in uniform across six decades\". He also said he valued the fact that Mr Hagel had \"given it to me straight\" in private conversations about policy in the Oval Office.\n\nThat was seen by some, however, as a polite reference to what had been deepening disagreements between the two men. For his part, Mr Hagel is known to have been frustrated by his inability to penetrate the tight circle of national security advisors around Mr Obama.\n\nMr Hagel is also surely taking the fall for what, by any standards, has been a rocky period for American foreign and defence policy that has left Mr Obama appearing always to be playing catch-up with events overseas rather than being in control of them. That sense of his floundering has cost him dearly.\n\nMany critical policy questions - all of key interest to America's allies, including Britain - remain unresolved and the replacing of Mr Hagel may be the moment they are met head-on. Certainly that is what Republicans are bound to press hard for.\n\n\"This personnel change must be part of a larger re-thinking of our strategy to confront the threats we face abroad, especially the threat posed by the rise of ISIL,\" John Boehner, the House speaker, said in a statement, using a different acronym for Isis.\n\nOn Afghanistan, Mr Obama is rumoured to be preparing to reverse himself and allow a small number of soldiers to stay in the country beyond the end of the year, with limited combat roles.\n\nOn Isis, few in Washington doubt that Mr Obama will have to confront more squarely the realities on the ground and whether he can hold to his promise to the American people not to deploy ground troops to defeat it.\n\nMany in the US military, including General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have made clear their view that some combat role for US soldiers may become necessary.\n\nIf Mr Obama, who was elected on a promise to end American involvement in wars overseas, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, is preparing to embrace a more forceful pose in the last quarter of his presidency, then cutting Mr Hagel loose may be part of the shift. That surely is the hope of Republicans who will attempt to use hearings to confirm his success to push the US onto a newly hawkish track.\n\nCritically, the person likely to run those hearings, as the likely next chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is Senator John McCain. He will be maneouvering to ensure that in the end it is effectively he who picks America's next defence secretary and not Mr Obama.\n\nThe Arizona hawk has criticised Mr Obama relentlessly for being flabby on Syria and Iraq policy and has lamented the withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nToday, he said Mr Hagel had been \"frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision-making process\".\n\nHe added: \"His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micromanagement they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully. Chuck's situation was no different.\"\n\nAs a possible candidate, Ms Flournoy, who was number three in the Pentagon in Mr Obama's first term, has respect on both sides of the aisle from Congress and is considered a centrist.\n\nMr Obama may be tempted to nominate her in part because she would make the first female US defence secretary.\n\nOther names being mentioned today were Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and a former officer with the Army's 82nd Airborne; and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of defence.",

Those conversations have been ongoing for several weeks,\" the administration official said.\n\n\"A successor will be named in short order, but Secretary Hagel will remain as Defense Secretary until his replacement is confirmed by the United States Senate.\"\n\nThe White House did not give any clue who might be Hagel's eventual replacement at the Pentagon, but the New York Times -- which broke the news of his departure -- cited three candidates.\n\nFormer under-secretary of defense Michele Flournoy is said to be in the running, along with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island -- a former army officer -- and former deputy secretary of defence Ashton Carter.\n\nWITHDRAWAL\n\nHagel, as a Republican senator, voted in favor of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, but later became a critic of the drawn out conflict that ensued and was taken on by Obama early last year to oversee the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.\n\nHagel's experience as a non-commissioned officer who saw action in Vietnam was seen as a strength as he took on the job, but his public appearances have often appeared clumsy or underwhelming as the US administration struggles to adapt to new conflicts.\n\n\"Over the past two years, Secretary Hagel helped manage an intense period of transition for the United States Armed Forces, including the drawdown in Afghanistan, the need to prepare our forces for future missions, and tough fiscal choices to keep our military strong and ready,\" the official said.\n\n\"Over nearly two years, Secretary Hagel has been a steady hand, guiding our military through this transition, and helping us respond to challenges from ISIL to Ebola.\"\n\nThough initially a Republican, Mr Hagel's strained relations with the Republican party leadership were seen as a reason for his decision not to pursue a White House run in 2008.\n\nSome Republicans had never forgiven him for his strident criticism of George W Bush's administration during the Iraq war.\n\nThough he voted for the resolution authorising the conflict, he went on to become a fierce critic.

                    "body": "When Barack Obama looks in the mirror these days, he must see a terrifying visage staring back at him: that of George W. Bush.\n\nIn a cruel echo of history, Obama is morphing into the president whose foreign policy he campaigned to overturn. Obama on Monday morning sacked his Pentagon secretary, Chuck Hagel, after huge midterm election losses in the sixth year of his presidency -- just as Bush did in sacking Donald Rumsfeld after midterm losses in the sixth year of his presidency.\n\nAs with Bush, the ouster comes as a war in the Middle East is going badly -- then, the Iraq war, now, the bombing of the Islamic State terror group. Rumsfeld's ouster led to the surge in Iraq, and Hagel's departure comes amid signs of an expanded role for U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. And, as under Bush, this guarantees that Obama will leave his successor an ongoing U.S. war in the Mideast -- quite possibly the sort of ground war Obama vowed to undo.\n\nThe neo-cons who dominated the Bush administration feel some vindication watching Obama struggle to avoid repeating history. Dov Zakheim, a Bush-era Pentagon official, said Hagel was offered up as a \"sacrificial lamb\" by a White House trying to stall further escalation in Syria and Iraq. But \"I just don't think they have that luxury\" of avoiding an expanded U.S. role, he said. \"They'll agonize as long as they possibly can, but the clock is ticking a lot faster than they anticipated.\"\n\nWhite House officials insisted Hagel and Obama \"arrived together\" at the decision for Hagel to leave, but the stagecraft suggested it wasn't voluntary -- a hastily arranged event in the State Dining Room with just 20 people seated in two rows (a smattering of top White House officials, Cabinet officers and military types) providing exaggerated applause after Obama offered effusive praise of the man he was dismissing with no successor named. Hagel looked as if he couldn't wait for the thing to end.\n\nHagel's departure speech, pulled from his left breast pocket, said everything you need to know about why Obama agreed with Hagel that \"it was an appropriate time for him to complete his service.\" Hagel thanked the president and the vice president, his colleagues and the generals, the troops, Congress, his foreign counterparts and his family. But he made not a single mention of the war against the Islamic State.\n\nHagel listed his accomplishments -- the pullout from Afghanistan, strengthened alliances, reforms within the Pentagon -- but said nothing about the renewal of war in the region that has bedeviled the United States for decades.\n\nAnd that almost certainly is the real reason behind Hagel's departure. The Republican former senator, a decorated veteran and the first enlisted man to hold the top job at the Pentagon, was brought in to help Obama wind down wars and to shrink the Pentagon. His strong ties to the military and his reluctance to use force (he had opposed the Iraq surge) made him an ideal man for the job, and his battle wounds from Vietnam gave him the moral authority to answer the chicken hawks who opposed the contraction of the military.\n\nBut now Islamic militants have taken over much of Iraq and Syria, and even Jimmy Carter has said the Obama administration was too slow in responding. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has begun to float the idea of ground troops. Even recovering isolationist Rand Paul has called for a declaration of war. Obama, whether he likes it or not, is going to need a Pentagon chief to oversee this war he doesn't want to fight.\n\nObama went on at great length about the \"class and integrity\" of the \"great friend\" he was pushing out the door, praising Hagel for everything from drawing down U.S. forces in Afghanistan to working to reduce sexual assaults.\n\nOnly in passing did Obama mention the war that threatens to dominate the last two years of his presidency. He said Hagel \"helped build the international coalition\" to fight the Islamic State and praised Hagel for his work on reshaping the military to \"meet long-term threats while still responding to immediate challenges.\"\n\nHagel stuck to the safe terrain of praising the \"fun\" of team building, taking care to wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving.\n\nHagel, a man of peace, can now at least enjoy the holiday, knowing he'll be free of this new war once the Senate confirms a successor -- no doubt after many I-told-you-so's from Republican hawks about the Islamic State.\n\nFor Hagel's boss, being dragged into expanding just the sort of war he was elected to end, there is no such relief.",

He occasionally contradicted and angered the White House, in particular on its policies in the fight against ISIL.\n\nMr Hagel never quite recovered from attacks during that process by fellow Republicans for his opposition to sanctions against Iran, his criticism of the 2007 US troop surge in Iraq and comments he made on the power of what he called the \"Jewish lobby\" in Washington.\n\nUS defence officials were quoted in US media as insisting the decision was made by both Mr Hagel and Mr Obama after two weeks of discussions, and that he will stay in office until a replacement is nominated and confirmed by congress.\n\nMr Hagel, an opponent of the Iraq war, was brought on to steer the defence department through its drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan and the deep cuts to defence spending after a decade of ballooning budgets.\n\nBut the US has been drawn back into a new conflict in the Middle East against a virulent extremist group, and the defence officials were reported as saying that Mr Hagel lacked the particular skills needed in a defence secretary for a new kind of war.\n\nThe administration has been criticised for its handling of the fight against ISIL and having an incoherent strategy, particularly with regards to Syria. Mr Hagel himself has clashed with the White House on the issue. Mr Obama could be looking for a replacement better able to present his positions to the public.\n\nMr Hagel was reportedly frustrated with the White House's tight control over public statements on the ISIL fight, which aides said he thought confused allies and made it even more difficult for him to explain his thoughts publicly.\n\nThe defence secretary was dispatched by Mr Obama on a number of occasions to the Arabian Gulf to reassure leaders about Washington's commitment to the region as the White House indicated it was hoping to focus less on the Middle East and \"pivot\" to East Asia.\n\nThe interim nuclear deal with Iran exacerbated these fears, but the renewed US military role in the region, in coalition with traditional allies, against ISIL has added a measure of reassurance, though concerns remain in the Gulf about Mr Obama's strategy to defeat ISIL.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Hagel met separately in Washington with counterparts from Qatar and Saudi Arabia to discuss the coalition against ISIL.\n\ntkhan@thenational.ae",

                    "body": "Seg\u00fan fuentes, Hagel acept\u00f3 permanecer en el cargo hasta que su sucesor sea confirmado por el Senado.\n\nWASHINGTON - El secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Chuck Hagel, anunci\u00f3 el lunes su retiro del gabinete del presidente Barack Obama, que ocurre bajo presi\u00f3n despu\u00e9s de un per\u00edodo complicado en que luch\u00f3 por penetrar el herm\u00e9tico c\u00edrculo de asesores de seguridad nacional de la Casa Blanca. En una ceremonia en la Casa Blanca, Obama dijo el lunes que \u00e9l y Hagel llegaron a la conclusi\u00f3n de que era \"un momento adecuado para que completara su servicio\". Hagel, de 68 a\u00f1os, es el primer alto funcionario en el gobierno de Obama que deja su cargo despu\u00e9s de la derrota del Partido Dem\u00f3crata, al que pertenece el presidente, en las elecciones legislativas del 4 de noviembre. Tambi\u00e9n ocurre en momentos en que el equipo de seguridad nacional del presidente ha sido conmovido por crisis como el surgimiento del grupo Estado Isl\u00e1mico en Irak y Siria y las provocaciones rusas en Ucrania. El presidente elogi\u00f3 a Hagel, un republicano que lleg\u00f3 a ser muy allegado de Obama cuando ambos estaban en el Senado, como un \"secretario de Defensa ejemplar\" que forj\u00f3 un v\u00ednculo estrecho con los militares desplegados en varios puntos del mundo. Hagel, que sirvi\u00f3 en la Guerra de Vietnam, es el primer ex militar que particip\u00f3 en combate que llega a secretario de Defensa. \"Chuck Hagel se ha dedicado a nuestra seguridad nacional y a nuestros hombres y mujeres uniformados a lo largo de seis d\u00e9cadas\", afirm\u00f3 Obama. Entre los principales candidatos para reemplazar a Hagel est\u00e1 Michele Flournoy, quien fue jefa de pol\u00edtica del Pent\u00e1gono durante tres a\u00f1os en el primer per\u00edodo del presidente Obama. Flournoy, quien ser\u00eda la primera mujer en dirigir el Pent\u00e1gono, es ahora jefa ejecutiva del Center for a New American Security, un grupo de estudios que fund\u00f3. Otros mencionados como posibles candidatos son Ash Carter, ex subsecretario de Defensa y Robert Work, que ocupa actualmente ese cargo. La salida de Hagel crea las condiciones para una posible confirmaci\u00f3n caldeada en el Senado. Los republicanos, que el mes pr\u00f3ximo toman el control de ese foro legislativo, han sido muy cr\u00edticos de la pol\u00edtica exterior de Obama. Aunque Obama ha tratado de consolidar sus decisiones de pol\u00edtica exterior en la Casa Blanca, los asesores han criticado en privado a Hagel por no participar m\u00e1s en las discusiones de seguridad del gabinete. Hagel tambi\u00e9n ha enfurecido a funcionarios de la Casa Blanca con una reciente carta a la asesora de seguridad nacional, Susan Rice, en la que dijo que Obama necesita expresar una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s clara del enfoque del gobierno sobre el presidente sirio Bashar Assad. En lo que pareci\u00f3 un esfuerzo por rechazar esas cr\u00edticas, Obama dijo el lunes que Hagel siempre \"fue franco\" durante sus conversaciones privadas en la Oficina Oval de la Casa Blanca. El senador John McCain, el republicano por Arizona que debe tomar la presidencia de la Comisi\u00f3n de Servicios Armados de ese cuerpo legislativo, dijo que Hagel se ha sentido \"frustrado con aspectos de la pol\u00edtica de seguridad nacional del gobierno y el proceso de toma de decisiones\". \"Sus predecesores han hablado sobre el exceso de control a que son sometidos por la Casa Blanca y las dificultades que eso ha creado para hacer su trabajo con eficiencia\", dijo McCain, refiri\u00e9ndose a las cr\u00edticas p\u00fablicas de Robert Gates y Leon Panetta. \"La situaci\u00f3n de Chuck no fue diferente\". Hagel acept\u00f3 permanecer en el cargo hasta que su sucesor sea confirmado por el Senado.\n\nBolet\u00edn de Noticias\n\nSuscr\u00edbete a nuestros boletines de noticias\n\nEmail para suscribirte:",

Los republicanos, que a partir del 1 de diciembre asumir\u00e1n la mayor\u00eda en la c\u00e1mara, han sido muy cr\u00edticos de la pol\u00edtica exterior de Obama.\n\nEl ex senador por Nebraska se hab\u00eda puesto al frente del Pent\u00e1gono en febrero de 2013 en sustituci\u00f3n de Leon Panetta.\n\nSus principales misiones fueron recortar el presupuesto militar estadounidense, que todav\u00eda sigue en niveles alt\u00edsimos como consecuencia de los atentados del 11-S, hace 13 a\u00f1os, y planificar la retirada de Afganist\u00e1n.\n\nSu renuncia llega, adem\u00e1s, cuando acaba de conocerse que Obama firm\u00f3 recientemente una orden autorizando la extensi\u00f3n del papel de las tropas estadounidenses en Afganist\u00e1n en 2015 y por la que podr\u00edan involucrarse en operaciones de combate, inform\u00f3 la agencia de noticias EFE.\n\nHagel fue un gran cr\u00edtico de George W. Bush durante su presidencia y de la guerra de Irak, que en un principio aprob\u00f3 pero que posteriormente consider\u00f3 \"la metida de pata m\u00e1s peligrosa en la pol\u00edtica exterior de este pa\u00eds desde Vietnam\".\n\nHoy, durante su comparecencia para anunciar su renuncia, Hagel dijo que haber sido jefe del Pent\u00e1gono fue \"el mayor privilegio\" de su vida.\n\n\"Continuar\u00e9 apoy\u00e1ndolo, se\u00f1or presidente\", dijo a Obama al destacar, adem\u00e1s, el \"extraordinario liderazgo\" del mandatario y del vicepresidente Biden, quien tambi\u00e9n particip\u00f3 de la ceremonia.",

Hagel, en el cargo desde febrero de 2013, es la primera baja en la Administraci\u00f3n de Obama tras la derrota del Partido Dem\u00f3crata en las elecciones legislativas del 4 de noviembre.\n\nObama forz\u00f3 la dimisi\u00f3n de Hagel en una reuni\u00f3n el viernes, seg\u00fan The New York Times, el diario que adelant\u00f3 la noticia. En una comparecencia en la Casa Blanca, el presidente explic\u00f3 que acord\u00f3 el relevo de acuerdo con Hagel.\n\nEntre los sustitutos posibles que menciona el Times, se encuentran Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, ex subsecretaria de Defensa, el senador dem\u00f3crata Jack Reed y el ex secretario de Defensa adjunto Ashton Carter. Flournoy ser\u00eda la primera mujer secretaria de Defensa en la historia de EE UU.\n\nLa sustituci\u00f3n de Hagel supone un reconocimiento de que la pol\u00edtica exterior y de defensa de EU necesita ajustes. El ascenso del yihadismo del Estado Isl\u00e1mico en Irak y Siria y las tensiones con Rusia por Ucrania han obligado a reformular la estrategia de la primera potencia mundial. La Casa Blanca parece haber concluido que el actual jefe del Pent\u00e1gono no era la persona m\u00e1s adecuada para la tarea.\n\nObama nombr\u00f3 a Hagel para unas tares distintas a las que afronta ahora. El secretario de Defensa -- veterano de Vietnam, ex senador republicano y cr\u00edtico con la invasi\u00f3n de Irak de 2003 ordenada por Bush -- lleg\u00f3 al Pent\u00e1gono con la misi\u00f3n de organizar el repliegue de EU. Sus prioridades eran retirar las tropas de Afganist\u00e1n -- una guerra que dura 13 a\u00f1os -- y recortar los presupuestos militares.\n\nEl movimiento es similar al que el antecesor del dem\u00f3crata Obama, el republicano George W. Bush, hizo tras la derrota del Partido Republicano en las elecciones legislativas de 2006. Entonces Bush destituy\u00f3 a su secretario de Defensa, Donald Rumsfeld, aunque el peso de Rumsfeld en aquella Administraci\u00f3n era mayor que el de Hagel, un pol\u00edtico que siempre ha mantenido un perfil discreto.",

Hace seis a\u00f1os, el presidente 'hered\u00f3' de su antecesor, George W. Bush, a Robert Gates, al que sustituy\u00f3 en poco tiempo Leon Panetta, un \u00edntimo colaborador en la Casa Blanca de Bill Clinton. A Panetta lo relev\u00f3 Hagel, todo un veterano de Vietnam, en febrero de 2013.\n\nPero antes de exponer a su candidato a las fieras republicanas, Obama tendr\u00e1 que encontrarlo. Las quinielas de los principales medios estadounidenses coinciden en tres nombres: los de Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, vicesecretaria de Defensa entre 2009 y 2012 con Gates y Panetta; Ashton Carter, tambi\u00e9n ex alto cargo en el Pent\u00e1gono que ya son\u00f3 cuando al final se eligi\u00f3 a Hagel; y el senador por Rhode Island Jack Reed, que se autodescarta ya de entrada.\n\nLa trayectoria de todos ellos podr\u00eda avalar un proceso de confirmaci\u00f3n relativamente ordenado. A Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, incluso, Obama podr\u00eda tentarla con el caramelo de ser la primera mujer al frente del departamento.",
