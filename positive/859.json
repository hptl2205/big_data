                    "body": "A great white shark attack photo is amazing since it captures the moment right before the shark takes a huge bite. Critics are already highlighting how dangerous it was to use bait attached to a shark cage in the manner shown, since a lunging shark could be harmed in the process if it ran into the cage.\n\nIn a related report by The Inquisitr, a great white shark attack on a sea lion was caught on video by shark cage divers, but that's not nearly as crazy as the video showing killer whales attacking a tiger shark and tearing it to pieces. Australia also had the luck to catch two great white sharks battling it out on camera. But if you are looking for something relatively \"cute,\" you should check out the article on the baby great white shark.\n\nAmanda Brewer is an art teacher in New Jersey who captured the great white shark photo on her GoPro camera, which she bought literally days before the event occurred. Brewer visited South Africa to volunteer with the eco-tourism and research group White Shark Africa as a summer intern. As part of this work, she had a chance to go into a shark cage, but she did not wear a mask or scuba gear since the cage was only partially submerged. And that's when luck favored her outing.\n\n\"[The great white shark] came out of nowhere and just kind of lunged out of the water, and I just happened to have had my GoPro in the exact right place at the exact right time. It really was just luck.\"\n\nAlthough she managed to capture 30 images with her GoPro camera, she did not realize what she had until she was able to upload them to her iPad back at the office.\n\n\"Immediately it was, 'Oh my goodness. Everybody take a look,'\" Brewer recalled. \"'I think I really got something here. This photo is really gonna do something.'\"\n\nBut people like Ricardo Lacombe were less than impressed with the great white shark attack photo, and complained on the White Shark Interest Group page.\n\n\"Bait usage is fine in my book as an attractant, but dragging it at the cage like this is asking for trouble for the shark. So disappointed this shot is getting so much coverage ... but a chance to try and educate people I guess.\"\n\nBut Brewer says critics do not know the whole story.\n\n\"The person was pulling the bait around and out of the way of the cage [to Brewer's right] so that shark wouldn't go near the cage at all,\" Brewer said. \"That's one thing that we learned right off the bat, is that you never want the shark to make contact with the cage. And you also don't want the shark to eat the bait. You don't feed the sharks; that's not what we want to do.\"\n\nThe fish eye lens used to capture the great white shark photo did not show how the apex predator lunged about three feet away from the cage. Despite the controversy, Amanda Brewer believes the response to the photo has been \"incredibly positive,\" and has given a chance to White Shark Africa to educate the public.\n\nWhat do you think about the great white shark photo?",

                    "body": "A schoolteacher's dramatic photo of a great white shark has gone viral, inspiring a lively Internet debate about whether it's ethical to bait sharks, many of which are threatened species, so that tourists can see them up close.\n\nThe buzz-worthy photo, which shows the shark lunging for fish bait, looks like a frame from a Steven Spielberg movie. But it was made by a young New Jersey teacher who spent the summer cage diving in South Africa.\n\nThe amateur diver and photographer, Amanda Brewer, 26, took the photo of the female great white shark off Seal Island in Mossel Bay, South Africa, then uploaded it to National Geographic's Your Shot community.\n\nThe primary school art teacher from New Jersey has not responded to National Geographic's requests for comment, but she told the media that she had spent time this summer cage diving with the eco-tourism company White Shark Africa. (White Shark Africa has also not responded to requests for comment.)\n\n\"I wasn't even a little bit frightened,\" Brewer told Time Lightbox about her encounter while cage diving. \"When you're there and you're in their presence, it's not scary. They're beautiful and graceful, and you can see how intelligent they are.\" (See more shark photos.)\n\nBrewer said she made the image with a GoPro camera she had purchased just before her trip. The camera's fish-eye lens made the shark seem closer and more menacing than it was in real life, she noted. After she posted it online to Instagram and Your Shot, people started sharing it heavily, perhaps because of the photo's intense sense of action. (The image was also featured in Your Shot's Daily Dozen.)\n\nA Shark in Danger?\n\nSome observers have expressed concern about how close the animal appears to the cage.\n\nRicardo Lacombe posted on the White Shark Interest Group Facebook page: \"Bait usage is fine in my book as an attractant, but dragging it at the cage like this is asking for trouble for the shark. So disappointed this shot is getting so much coverage ... but a chance to try and educate people I guess.\"\n\nResponding to the criticism, Brewer told Grind TV that White Shark Africa never pulls bait into or even directly toward cages.\n\n\"The person was pulling the bait around and out of the way of the cage [to Brewer's right] so that shark wouldn't go near the cage at all,\" she said. \"That's one thing that we learned right off the bat, is that you never want the shark to make contact with the cage.\"\n\nGregory Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist who studies sharks for the state of Massachusetts, told National Geographic that fears about this shark hitting the cage are probably overblown. \"In my opinion, it's not likely the shark would be injured by the cage,\" he says.\n\n\"These are remarkably tough animals,\" he adds. \"I have seen them heavily scarred up by each other, with parts having been bitten off, and they have an amazing capacity to heal.\"\n\nSouth Africa requires cage divers to obtain permits and follow strict safety guidelines, Skomal notes. In a few cases, smaller sharks have gotten stuck trying to swim inside cages, \"but that's extremely rare,\" he says. (Watch: \"World's Deadliest: Sharks vs. Seals.\")\n\nAre Shark Cages and Baiting Harmful?\n\nA more important question, says Skomal, is whether the use of diving cages could injure sharks in the long term, by teaching them to associate human beings with food.\n\nMost sharks find people alien to their environment and tend to avoid them, the scientist says. But if sharks begin to associate people with the scent or presence of bait, aka food, they could become more aggressive or start to approach fishers, looking for a meal. (See \"Scientists Track a Great White Across the Atlantic for the First Time.\")\n\nTrouble is, there is very little data to support that hypothesis, so Skomal says that has left the scientific and conservation communities to speculate and debate.\n\n\"It's a little like the debate over zoos,\" he says, \"with some people saying they don't think caging animals is good for them and others saying there is a benefit to education.\"\n\nDolphins sometimes get into trouble by becoming too friendly with people, says Greg Stone, a marine biologist and executive vice president of Conservation International who has studied dolphin behavior around humans. He has not studied the same process in sharks but says that it's logical to think it could happen. (Stone has received two grants from National Geographic over the years, the most recent in 2000.)\n\nAs for whether baited sharks start to associate humans with a meal, Brewer told reporters that White Shark Africa takes care to ensure sharks don't actually get to eat the bait. \"You don't feed the sharks; that's not what we want to do,\" she said.\n\nBut, Stone says, \"whether they get the bait or not, if you are providing them with scent or bait you are altering their natural system.\" He notes that he has been on dives in which people baited sharks \"and they got aggressive.\"\n\n\"So I'm not a big proponent of baiting sharks,\" he says.\n\nStill, there are exceptions, Stone says. \"I've been out with National Geographic photographers in remote areas and they needed to get pictures, so they used bait. But it was probably the first and last time those sharks ever experienced that, so it's not a big deal. But if you do it routinely, you alter the system.\" (See \"Great Whites Thriving in U.S. Waters.\")\n\nBrewer said White Shark Africa combines tourist-type experiences with science and data collection, including tagging and identifying individual sharks. Skomal says he knows such operations in South Africa have contributed in meaningful ways.\n\nBut Stone cautions that the number of operations and cages in the water may be too much. \"I think some of those sharks are probably getting habituated,\" he says.\n\n\"Citizen science is a great idea, but I'd rather see people count seals along the coastline or collect other types of data that are really needed,\" says Stone. \"I'm not sure if going out and swimming with the dolphins or diving in a shark cage in a place where everybody has studied great whites is going to add anything.\"",

The photo has received more than 350,000 views on Instagram and 80,000 likes on Facebook as of Oct. 8.\n\nAccording to Grind TV, Amanda Brewer was in South Africa volunteering with the eco-tourism and research group White Shark Africa.\n\nBrewer, 26, says that she captured the amazing image with a GoPro camera that she purchased just days before her trip, and that she is not a skilled photographer.\n\nBrewer was inside of a shark cage when the giant beast lunged out of the water. Her GoPro camera caught 30 quick images of the close encounter. Once she returned to White Shark Africa's office, she uploaded the photos to her iPad and was amazed at what she saw.\n\nBrewer told Time that she hung the photo in her New Jersey classroom after returning to the United States. The teacher says that her students have been inspired by her close encounter.\n\nNot everyone has been impressed by the photo though. One critic reportedly said that the research group is asking for trouble by dragging bait close to a cage, and he is disappointed at the attention the photograph has received.\n\nBrewer says that the neither the shark nor the bait was actually as close to the cage as it appears. She says that the fish-eye lens on the GoPro camera made both appear closer than they were. She also says that the group never feeds the sharks.\n\nWATCH INTERVIEW WITH ABC NEWS\n\nMore ABC news videos | ABC Entertainment News",

She has been responding to criticism that dragging the bait so close to the cage could have resulted in injury to the shark. Brewer told GrindTV, \"The person was pulling the bait around and out of the way of the cage so that shark wouldn't go near the cage at all.\"\n\nOpinion is divided among experts in the scientific and conservation communities. Some argue that sharks are battle-hardened predators that carry the scars of far worse encounters than could be inflicted by a bump with a shark cage. Others point out that the more important issue is whether baiting is teaching sharks to associate humans with food, noting that it has been observed that sharks become more aggressive when baited. With the increasing popularity of cage diving for sharks, some believe that the natural behaviors of some sharks are being altered because there are simply too many operators and too many cages in the water.\n\nThe debate surrounding shark diving isn't likely to be resolved anytime soon, but the photographer herself isn't fazed by the discussion. \"This photo has gotten so much recognition and most has been incredibly positive. Now people are talking about the sharks. Now we educate. That's how you make a difference.\"",

It's an incredible close encounter with a great white. This was shot by a school teacher visiting South Africa who says she was just in the right place at the right time. But it's a true one in a million shot. It's the jaw-dropping photo even scarier than jaws itself. And it's going viral this morning. Big-time. Over 350,000 likes on instagram. Over 78,000 likes on Facebook. And the brave soul who snapped the too-close for comfort pict, says it was luck. I went with the gopro camera in hand, and it was a perfect storm. Reporter: Amanda brewer is an art teacher in New Jersey. But she spent her summer vacation doing something more dangerous. Interning for an animal conservation group in south Africa. She had the camera set to take a stream of rapid pictures one after another hoping to catch something. Boy did she. The shark came up out of the water and I got the shot. Reporter: This morning, the photo not just making a splash on the internet, it's also earning a special place hanging in her classroom for all of her impressed students to see. They see the picture in the classroom and they're all so excited about it. It's been an amazing experience to share with my students. Reporter: She hopes that the photo will get people talking about sharks and help conserve the beautiful animals. I agree with that. But I will not be swimming in the ocean any time soon. Like bringing the music back. Get going in the morning. Get the blood pressure up. We can agree with that. Shark week. You talked about that. I did. The great whites get that gummy look. They are some weird animals. Kind of Jim carry, fire marshal bill, remember that? I do remember that. Can't get that out of my head.",

She got caught in fishing gear and had injuries to her stomach, snout and dorsal.\n\nWhile treating her, crews also got another surprise. They learned the shark, nicknamed Marina, was pregnant, carrying several pups.\n\nAfter a week of special care, Marina was ready to head back home. It is opportunity that is not always a possibility for sharks that are rescued.\n\n\"They show up on beaches and that's usually the very end,\" said Mike Price, who is with SeaWorld. \"They give up. We got lucky with this one. We were able to rescue it, stabilize it, get it ready and return it.\"\n\n10News came along for her release. SeaWorld officials say Marina's visit gave them the opportunity to learn more about the creatures that are key to our ecosystem.\n\n\"Sharks are so important to the ecosystem that our ability to save this one shark speaks to helping out kelp forest and sandy shores,\" said Price.",

Individual sharks, scientists say, have personalities.\n\nApparently some sharks are totally social and like nothing more than hanging out together in big sharky underwater parties, while others are more emo in their outlook, preferring to hang out by themselves.\n\nIn the study, published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, scientists at the University of Execter observed and recorded the social interactions of juvenile spotted catsharks held in captivity under a range of conditions. It turns out that the more social catsharks remained gregarious even when their habitat was changed, while the more introverted creatures just sat on the bottom and tried to blend in like a shy teenager at a Blue Light Disco.\n\nBehavioural ecologist Dr David Jacoby said: \"We found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed, socially well-connected individuals remained well-connected under each new habitat. In other words, their social network positions were repeated through time and across different habitats.\n\n\"These results were driven by different social preferences that appeared to reflect different strategies for staying safe. Well-connected individuals formed conspicuous groups, while less social individuals tended to camouflage alone, matching their skin colour with the colour of the gravel substrate in the bottom of the tank.\"\n\nProfessor Darren Croft, of the Centre for Research into Animal Behaviour in Psychology at the University of Exeter, added: \"What is interesting is that these behaviours differ consistently among individuals. This study shows, for the first time, that individual sharks possess social personalities.\"\n\nSo little catsharks have different personalities, but surely the toothy terrors that lurk off our coasts have only one mode -- angry.\n\nNot so says Andrew Fox, leader of Rodney Fox Shark Expiditions.\n\nMr Fox has observed thousands of great whites in the wild, and says while we shouldn't impose human traits in wild animals, there was no doubt that individual sharks showed different types of behaviour.\n\n\"We have almost 1000 sharks on our catalogue, and I know hundreds by name,\" Mr Fox said.\n\n\"There is definitely a social heirachy, and it's not always size-related. You get feisty small sharks, old smart sharks. Some are cruisy and mellow, some are more bold.\"\n\nMr Fox said research was helping to dispel the myths around sharks. \"What I think is great is that we no longer think of them of the black-eyed monsters from Jaws -- they're individual animals with different personalities.\"",

Anyone can purchase a small, plastic, numbered shark for $10 each. A big front-end loader will drop all the purchased sharks into Beaver Creek and that's when the race begins. Kids can watch the sharks float along in the creek and the first shark to cross the finish line will win the BMS Pace Car, donated by Tri-Cities Area Ford Dealers. In addition, the top 10 sharks to cross the finish line will also receive prizes. You do not have to be present to win.\n\nSharks are available for purchase now and up to 1 p.m. on the day of the event. They may be purchased at Heart of Tennessee Gym in Johnson City, the BMS ticket office or online at bristol.speedwaycharities.org.\n\nAccording to Claudia Byrd, director of Speedway Children's Charities Bristol Chapter, \"Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies purchased and donated the sharks. All of the prizes, including the grand prize, the Ford Pace Car donated by Tri-Cities Area Ford Dealers, have been donated by businesses. Because of these gracious donations, all of the money collected goes towards the charities.\"\n\nIn addition to the fun Sharky 500, a Kids Expo takes place with many of the speedway charity grant recipient organizations participating. There will be tables set up with crafts, pumpkin decorating, face painting, games and more. A stage will be set up with music, live remote with local station 94.9, and various dance and gymnastics schools performing. Children can explore fire engines, and local police will have a K-9 display.\n\nByrd said she has 10,000 sharks to sell and the most they have sold in the past is approximately 7,500.\n\nSpeedway Children Charities benefit local organizations, such as local Boys and Girls Clubs, CASA, Girls Inc., Hope House, Kari's Heart Foundation, Small Miracles and Second Harvest Food Bank, as well as many other agencies in our area devoted to making life safer, healthier and hopeful for our future generations.\n\nFor more information, contact Claudia Byrd at 423-989-6974 or email Claudia@bristolmotorspeedway.com.

But, you can't really focus on it too much or let it get in your way or in your head.\n\n\"I'll try to stay positive.\"\n\nDown in Tampa Bay, Brewer -- who, at 35, is the oldest d-man on the Tampa Bay roster -- was equally upset about being left out of the lineup for a date against the Panthers.\n\n\"It's been a long time,\" Brewer said, per the Tampa Bay Times. \"It's been a very long time. It's their decision. I don't like it.\"\n\nUnlike Larsson, who's being scratched in favor of three youngsters in Gelinas, Merrill and Severson, Brewer was unable to crack a very deep and very experienced blueline for opening night. Bolts head coach Jon Cooper explained as much, saying the team's defensive depth basically kept Brewer out of the mix -- Tampa will go with Anton Stralman, Victor Hedman, Jason Garrison, Radko Gudas, Matt Carle and Andrej Sustr tonight, and Cooper acknowledged Brewer's displeasure with the choices.\n\n\"If Eric Brewer has to sit for a game, I'm sure he doesn't like it, and he's pissed,\" Cooper said. \"I'm pissed to have to do it.\"",

Berkley filmed \"One Dive, Two Hundred Hammerhead Sharks\" on a recent trip to Cocos, where he was treated to a schooling spectacle unlike one he had seen before. According to Berkley:\n\n\"We were ending another epic dive at the world famous pinnacle known as Alcyone. The current was next to nothing yet the hammerheads were boiling up out of the deep. At the end of the dive we came up as a group and drifted off the buoy line. In the distance we saw a large dark cloud that I assumed was a giant school of jacks. It turned out to be well over 200 hammerhead sharks. As I drifted into this mega school I could see the sharks twitch when they saw me. I thought it was over when the school split into two groups, but then both groups circled back in a giant figure eight pattern to make eye contact over and over again. I was so excited I'm not sure how I kept the camera steady. It was truly one of the best dives of my life.\"\n\nIt's going to be tough to beat that one.

                    "body": "PRLog - Oct. 8, 2014 - ALL, South Africa -- Durban is famed for its golden beaches and sub-tropical climate, but that's not all there is to South Africa's city of sunshine. Recently named \"the coolest city in South Africa\" by CNN, Durban is a diverse city offering an abundance of things to do and places to see. From trendy cafes and fun-filled leisure activities, to an intriguing cultural heritage and amazing shopping opportunities, Durban definitely has something for everyone.\n\nHere is First Car Rental's guide to the Top 10 things to do in Durban:\n\n1. Explore the Golden Mile\n\nExperience the vibrancy of Durban from the iconic Golden Mile. The four-mile long beach borders Durban city centre from Blue Lagoon just north of the city to Addington Beach and Durban Harbour in the south. Here you'll get a taste of Durban's charm, from colourful rickshaws, to waterparks, surfers, kite boarders, sand sculptures and numerous Blue Flag beaches. The brick-paved promenade stretching along the entire Golden Mile makes it ideal for walking, jogging or cycling, while soaking up the warm Indian Ocean breeze and Durban sunshine.\n\n2. Visit Africa's oldest botanic gardens\n\nEstablished in 1849, Durban's Botanic Gardens are the oldest botanical gardens in Africa and Durban's oldest public institution. Take a stroll through the stunning grounds while discovering hundreds of indigenous and exotic plant collections from sub-tropical climates. In the grounds there's also a herbarium, an orchid house, a garden for the blind and a charity tea garden. The Gardens are open seven days a week with regular weekly activities and events taking place, including concerts and Victorian tea parties.\n\n3. Shop till you drop\n\nDurban offers many different shopping experiences, from world-class malls to exotic street markets. The modern, open-plan design of Gateway Theatre of Shopping and Wavehouse in Umhlanga is ideal for a relaxing, effortless and fun retail experience. Grab a bargain in one of the street markets in and around the city or visit the Indian district in downtown Durban for a huge selection of goods from the East as well as spices and curry powders. For boutique shopping, make sure to visit the Stables Lifestyle Market, which is open on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, and the Essenwood Market on Saturday.\n\n4. Discover the Moses Mabhida Stadium\n\nThe iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium is definitely a must-see for anyone visiting Durban. This architectural masterpiece was built for the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup and now also offers a variety of activities, including the sky car that whisks visitors up the stadium's arch to a viewing platform at its peak, with stunning 360\u00b0 views of Durban and the ocean. If your heart, lungs and nerves are up to it, then tackle the Big Rush Big Swing - the world's only stadium swing and the biggest swing of any kind anywhere. The swing launches people 106m above the pitch and travels in a gut-wrenching 220m arc under the stadium arch.\n\n5. Encounter the ocean at uShaka Marine World\n\nuShaka Marine World is one of Durban's prime attractions, offering non-stop adventure for the young and old alike. Discover the wonders of the ocean at Sea World, the largest aquarium in the southern hemisphere, with underground viewing galleries that travel 500 meters through a series of four ship wrecks. Get up, close and personal with dolphins, sharks and other sea creatures in the Animal Encounters complex. Wet 'n Wild, uShaka's world-class water park, offers a variety of exhilarating entertainment, including free-fall slides, super tubes and rafting.\n\n6. Go on a Durban city walkabout\n\nDiscover the historical side of Durban by going on a guided walking tour through the city centre. Choose from two tours: The Oriental Walkabout where you'll learn about Durban's ties to the East, visiting landmarks such as the Juma Musjid Mosque and the Victoria Street Market, and the Historical Walkabout, visiting iconic buildings such as the City Hall, which was built in the early 1900s in classic neo-Baroque-style architecture. Walking not your style? Hop in your rental car and download First Car Rental's City Guide App and travel to Durban's top attractions.\n\n7. Learn about sharks\n\nKwaZulu-Natal is the only coastal province in South Africa that uses shark safety gear such as nets and drum lines to protect swimmers, surfers and body boarders from shark attacks and the KZN Sharks Board is the organisation in charge of maintaining this gear. The Board also plays a vital role in researching shark behaviour, feeding and breeding, with a research centre on site. Visitors can go on an early morning boat trip to learn about how the Board maintains the safety gear, or learn all about sharks in the educational audio-visual lectures conducted at the Board's headquarters in Umhlanga.\n\n8. Eat out at the revolving restaurant\n\nTake in the extraordinary views while having a bite to eat at the legendary Roma Revolving Restaurant, located on the 32nd floor of the John Ross House and overlooking the whole of Durban and surrounding areas. The revolving restaurant is the third of its kind in the world and the only genuine revolving restaurant in the southern hemisphere. Roma has a speed control mechanism that allows a revolution of anything between 60 and 90 minutes. The restaurant is fully licensed and specialises in Italian cuisine.\n\n9. Challenge yourself at Giba Gorge MTB Park\n\nJust outside of Durban you'll find the Giba Gorge MTB Park, an off-road cycling venue where BMX, downhill and mountain-bike enthusiasts can test their skills on various tracks, each designed to challenge riders of a specific level. Mountain bikers can choose from three routes, ranging from 10.2km to 6.7km, while BMXers can try out dirt jumps that are considered some of the best in South Africa. Facilities at the site include a restaurant, picnic and camping sites, toilets, showers and ample parking. Other activities include hiking trails through the Giba Gorge.\n\n10. Get cultured\n\nDurban attracts some of South Africa's top artists and is home to a number of leading art galleries. These include KZNSA Gallery in Glenwood, which hosts installations and performance art events, and the Durban Art Gallery located inside the City Hall, featuring a diverse range of artwork dating as far back as the 15th century right up to the present. You can also check out artSPACE Durban on Millar Road, which showcases contemporary pieces by South African and international artists, and the African Art Centre on Florida Road, which is dedicated to supporting unemployed artists and craftspeople by allowing them to sell their artwork at the gallery.",

Son hermosos y puedes ver lo inteligentes que son\".\n\nBrewer tom\u00f3 la fotograf\u00eda con una c\u00e1mara GoPro que compr\u00f3 justo antes de su viaje. Seg\u00fan ella misma, el objetivo ojo de pez de la c\u00e1mara hace que parezca que el tibur\u00f3n estaba m\u00e1s cerca y era m\u00e1s amenazador de lo que era en realidad. Tras publicarla en Instagram y Your Shot, la comunidad fotogr\u00e1fica de National Geographic, fue compartida a gran velocidad.\n\n[Ver: Un mero devora de un bocado un tibur\u00f3n]\n\nAlgunos ya han mostrado su preocupaci\u00f3n por lo cerca que parece estar el animal de la jaula. Ricardo Lacombe, por ejemplo, public\u00f3 un post en la p\u00e1gina de Facebook de White Shark Interest Group en el que criticaba el uso de cebo para atraerlo a la jaula y lamentaba que la foto estuviera teniendo tanto \u00e9xito.\n\nEn respuesta a las cr\u00edticas, Brewer ha declarado que White Shark Africa nunca pone cebos en las jaulas o cerca de ellas. \"La persona responsable lanzaba cebo alrededor, lejos de la jaula. Lo primero que aprendes es que el tibur\u00f3n no debe entrar en contacto con la jaula\".\n\n[Ver im\u00e1genes: Lugares para bucear]\n\nGregory Skomal, bi\u00f3logo experto en tiburones, afirma que el temor de que el tibur\u00f3n golpee la jaula es exagerado. \"En mi opini\u00f3n, es muy poco probable que el tibur\u00f3n se da\u00f1e con la jaula\", afirma. \"Son animales muy fuertes. He visto tiburones con heridas provocadas por otros tiburones, incluso con trozos arrancados, y tienen una sorprendente capacidad para curarse\".\n\nSkomal insiste en que las personas que practican el buceo en jaula tienen que obtener permisos espec\u00edficos y seguir unas estrictas normas de seguridad. Se han dado casos en que tiburones peque\u00f1os se han quedado atrapados intentando entrar en las jaulas, pero \"es muy poco frecuente\".\n\n[Relacionado: Una nutria devora a un caim\u00e1n en Florida]",

La fotograf\u00eda dio la vuelta al mundo y caus\u00f3 furor en redes sociales, luego de que la mujer la publicar\u00e1 en su cuenta de Instagram.\n\nAs\u00ed fue como Amanda Brewer, profesora de arte en Nueva Jersey, salt\u00f3 a la fama, su foto del escualo lanzando una feroz mordida, fue retomada por varios portales de medios de comunicaci\u00f3n en el mundo, que destacaron lo imponente del gr\u00e1fico que revela al detalle los enormes dientes del animal marino.\n\nGracias a una invitaci\u00f3n de una organizaci\u00f3n que estudia la vida natural de los tiburones blancos, el destino puso a la joven de 25 a\u00f1os de edad, en el lugar y momento correcto. Bremer buceaba dentro de una jaula en la Isla Mossel, cuando se encontr\u00f3 de frente con el enorme escualo y aprovech\u00f3 para captar con su c\u00e1mara varias fotograf\u00edas.\n\nBrewer, tal vez, no imagin\u00f3 el \u00e9xito que tendr\u00edan sus im\u00e1genes... Tras subirlas a redes sociales, en minutos se volvieron virales.\n\nAhora, su fotograf\u00eda es analizada por la organizaci\u00f3n para la conservaci\u00f3n de animales y ecoturismo White Shark Africa.",
