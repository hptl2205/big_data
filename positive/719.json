Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters that the president is \"doing the wrong thing and I'll do whatever I can to override what he's trying to do.\"\n\nObama has said he will issue executive orders because the Republican-run House has refused to take up a Senate-approved immigration plan for more than a year.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSenate Democrats back Obama immigration orders\n\nObama is considering protecting up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from any deportation proceedings.Most of those are expected to be parents with children who were born in the U.S., meaning they are U.S. citizens.\n\nHe may also consider expanding the pool of young undocumented immigrants who have been protected under a 2012 program, or granting protections to undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for long periods of time.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday that the president will also improve border security. Only Congress can order the hiring of thousands of Border Patrol agents, but Obama can increase their salaries and redeploy immigration agents spread around the country to the southwest border.\n\nThe administration is also considering changes to a program called Secure Communities, which helps local police check the immigration status of suspects they've arrested for local crimes. That plan has angered many immigration advocates and Democrats who say it turns local police into immigration agents, while Republicans and some law enforcement officials say it's critical to track immigration violators around the country.\n\nNevada, where Obama speaks on Friday, is the state where the highest share of the population is undocumented.\n\nThe state's 210,000 undocumented immigrants make up 10.2% of the population, the only state in the double-digits, according to the Pew Research Center. That ranks Nevada ahead of immigrant-heavy states such as California (9.4%), Texas (8.9%), New Jersey (8.2%) and Florida (6.9%).\n\nObama has argued that Republicans in Congress have forced his hand by refusing to pass any kind of bill that fixes the nation's broken immigration system.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" the president said on his Facebook post. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long.\"\n\nThe Senate passed a bill in the summer of 2013 that was co-authored by a group of eight senators -- four Republicans and four Democrats. The bill would have allowed 8 million undocumented immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship after a 13-year legalization process, provided $38 billion to double the size of the Border Patrol and add new technology along the border, and revamp the legal immigration to allow more high-tech and lower-skilled workers to enter the country.\n\nBoehner refused to let his chamber consider that bill, saying he preferred a slower, step-by-step approach to immigration reform that started with border security. Boehner and other House leaders introduced a set of immigration \"principles\" in January that they said would guide their process. But over the summer, as more than 60,000 Central American children flooded the southwest border, Boehner declared the issue dead.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPoll: Resistance to Obama order on immigration\n\nObama, frustrated by that inaction, said he would respond by implementing a unilateral action. He indicated that it would represent an expansion of a program he created in 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, that has granted deportation protections to more than 580,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.\n\nBut the president missed his self-imposed deadline to act by the end of the summer. Democratic senators facing tight races pleaded with the White House to hold off, arguing that an executive action would rile up Republican opposition and kill their electoral chances. The president did so, but Democrats ended up losing the Senate anyway.\n\nSome of the GOP critics have discussed a lawsuit against what they called Obama's \"executive amnesty\" for people who are in the country, noting that in past years that the president himself has questioned his legal authority in these matters. They may also try to block the new orders through some sort of legislative action.\n\nPart of Obama's process has been a legal review of his options, aides said.\n\n\"What we'll be confidently able to do is to explain to you what legal authority the president is using to take these actions,\" Earnest said.\n\nIn a White House blog post that accompanied the Obama video, Earnest wrote that \"our immigration system has been broken for decades -- and every minute we fail to act, millions of people who live in the shadows but want to play by the rules and pay taxes have no way to live right by the law and contribute to our country.\"\n\n5242 CONNECT 270 TWEET 5 LINKEDIN 470 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1qWHYKr",

But reports are that the order would effectively shield up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation, and make them eligible for work permits. Many of them would be parents of so-called DREAMers -- young people who were allowed to remain in the United States and obtain work permits through an executive order Obama issued in 2012.\n\nThe eligible immigrants would not be entitled to federal benefits -- including health care tax credits -- under the plan, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe so-called DREAMers can obtain work permits but are not eligible for food stamps, federal welfare benefits or disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program. They also are ineligible for tax credits under Obama's health care law, though they can buy health coverage at full price on the exchanges created by the law. They might be eligible for public benefits provided by some states, however.\n\nPro-immigration activists in Southern Nevada preparing for the Friday rally said they are expecting Obama to take bold action.\n\n\"What will President Obama do to end senseless deportations and keep families together,\" said Astrid Silva, an organizer for PLAN, a leading progressive group in Nevada.\n\n\"Our immigration system is broken, and tearing families apart. President Obama has a duty to keep his promise and use his full legal authority to take action where Congress has failed,\" Silva said.\n\nSen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he planned to be at the event in Las Vegas.\n\n\"This is personal to me,\" Reid said in a statement. \"There is no issue I have worked on more in my time as Democratic Leader than immigration reform.\"\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 that offered a path to citizenship for as many as 11 million undocumented immigrants, along with stepped-up spending to increase security at the U.S. southern border.\n\nBut the Republican-led House has not acted, and Obama has said he did not want to wait any longer.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Democrats supportive of comprehensive immigration reform have sent letters to the White House and held rallies urging the president to use his executive powers to take aggressive action.\n\n\"I say to President Obama: Be brave, go big, go bold and go now!\" Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., said at an event on Tuesday.\n\nIn an interview with Univision on Monday, Reid said expanding the DREAM Act eligibility to cover parents \"would be, as far as I'm concerned, within the definition of big.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Republican leaders have vowed to fight tooth and nail, charging that Obama will be taking what amounts to \"executive amnesty\" on immigration. GOP lawmakers are considering stripping funding from federal agencies that would carry out the executive order.\n\nSome conservative members are threatening to pursue a government shutdown.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Wednesday that Obama's executive actions will be comprehensive and include border security measures. He said he believes that immigration changes that Obama will announce are not only legal but needed in light of inaction by Congress on immigration.\n\nJohnson spoke briefly about the president's plan during an event at the National Press Club on Wednesday, but didn't provide any details.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner's spokesman criticized Obama's plans, noting that the president himself has said in the past that he is not \"emperor\" and is limited in his ability to act on his own.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" the spokesman, Michael Steel, said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

                    "body": "President Obama said he would take executive action on immigration before the end of the year, and now he plans to outline the specifics of his plan in a prime-time address on Thursday night. Details that have leaked suggest the move could protect four to five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. Here's a guide for those who want to understand what will likely be the most significant change in U.S. immigration policy since the mid-'80s, or those who are merely curious about why Republicans are fuming about \"Emperor Obama.\"\n\nWhat is Obama expected to do?\n\nObama will announce that he is providing relief to various groups of undocumented immigrants thought executive action. The exact details are unknown, but he's expected to offer temporary protected status to the parents and spouses of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. They must have no criminal record and have lived in the U.S. for a certain number of years (probably five). It's estimated that there are about 3.71 million people in this group, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAbout a million additional people would be affected by other changes, including an expansion of the 2012 program that allowed \"Dreamers,\" or undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, to avoid deportation. Obama will probably increase the maximum current age from 30, and the maximum arrival age from 16, but the precise age limits are unknown.\n\nObama is also likely to announce some other shifts in immigration policy, including increasing visas for high-tech workers, reforming federal immigrant detention procedures, and measures to improve border security.\n\nWhat isn't included?\n\nThe plan is not expected to include protections for the parents of Dreamers, or farm workers. None of the undocumented immigrants allowed to stay in the country will have a path to citizenship, or be eligible for federal benefits, such as subsidies for Obamacare.\n\nWhere can I watch the address?\n\nNot on any of the major broadcast networks! The White House is miffed that when they put out feelers earlier this week, ABC, CBS, and NBC weren't interested in running the speech. \"In 2006, Bush gave a 17 minute speech that was televised by all three networks that was about deploying 6000 national guard troops to the border. Obama is making a 10 minute speech that will have a vastly greater impact on the issue. And none of the networks are doing it,\" a senior administration official told Politico.\n\nThe 8 p.m. ET address will air on PBS, cable news networks, and perhaps most importantly, on Telemundo and Univision. The latter is delaying the Latin Grammys broadcast for the speech, and the White House might have picked Thursday to reach the large number of Hispanics tuning in for the show.\n\nWhat has the White House said so far?\n\nObama announced that he'd be addressing the nation in a Facebook video posted on Wednesday afternoon, and simultaneously enraged those passionate about Oval Office decorum by sitting on his desk sans jacket. \"What I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem,\" Obama said.\n\nPost by The White House.\n\nOh yeah, what about that immigration reform bill in Congress?\n\nWhite House officials say Obama is only taking executive action because the House failed to pass the immigration reform bill approved by the Senate last year. \"Legislative action is always preferable,\" Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said at the National Press Club on Wednesday. \"But we have waited for Congress to act, and the Congress has not acted. It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system. And we will.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, one of the lead authors of the Senate bill, taunted House Republicans about their inaction. \"There's one more chance: Just put the bill on the floor, Speaker Boehner,\" Schumer said. \"Pass the bill and we will not even have to debate executive action.\"\n\nDoes Obama have the legal authority to do this?\n\nHe thinks so, though that wasn't always the case. Republicans have been circulating a list of 22 times Obama said that on immigration he's already done everything in his power. However, administration officials say the specific actions Obama is taking are \"legally unassailable.\" As the Washington Post explains, much of Obama's argument relies on prosecutorial discretion, or \"the widely accepted principle that law enforcement officers are responsible for choosing where to focus their efforts.\"\n\nThere's also a Republican precedent for Obama's executive action. Both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush extended protections to family members who weren't covered by the 1986 immigration reform law, and their actions weren't considered very controversial at the time.\n\nWhat do the Republicans say?\n\nThey think what Obama's likely to propose goes well beyond focusing on deporting criminals before Dreamers, and amounts to Obama unilaterally rewriting immigration law. \"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" said Michael Steel, the spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe GOP is already considering a range of options to stop Obama, including filing a lawsuit against him, passing legislation that would specifically block his immigration action next year, and shutting down the government again.\n\nA few have suggested Obama's executive action may be grounds for impeachment, and Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama said the president may deserve prison time, as it's a felony to help people illegally enter the U.S. \"At some point, you have to evaluate whether the president's conduct aids or abets, encourages, or entices foreigners to unlawfully cross into the United States of America,\" he said. \"That has a five-year in-jail penalty associated with it.\"\n\nOther Republicans are pushing a more cautious strategy. \"Our response has to be measured -- can't capitulate, can't overreact,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham, who worked on the Senate legislation. \"Impeachment or shutting down the entire government would be an unwise move.\"\n\nSo the next few weeks should be exciting. The president's executive action could push Congress to finally pass an immigration reform bill, or leave \"Emperor Obama\" rotting in a prison cell.",

So what I am going to be laying out are the things that I can do, with my lawful authority as president, to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\n\n>>> Commentary: Unilateral Amnesty Really Will Be Unprecedented, and Unconstitutional\n\nEarlier today, before the White House confirmed tomorrow's announcement, the AFL-CIO accidentally spilled the news.\n\nAFL-CIO inadvertently sent an internal email to reporters saying \"there will be a prime time Thursday announcement\" when Obama will reveal his plan.\n\nObama is scheduled to visit Del Sol High School in Las Vegas on Friday to expand on the details in front of a friendly audience.\n\nThe president began his renewed push for immigration reform in January 2013 during a speech at the same Las Vegas high school.\n\nAlthough the details of Obama's plan are not clear, news of his impending announcement was sure to roil some on Capitol Hill, provoking Republicans who believe the president is acting outside his power to shield up to 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\n\"Congress should fund the government while ensuring that no funds can be spent on this unlawful purpose,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n\nSessions and other Republicans have been preparing to respond with a strategy to use the \"power of the purse\" to withhold the funding Obama would need to implement his plan.\n\nJosh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said today the president would likely not support a budget that withholds funding to pay for his initiatives.\n\n\"It certainly would not be a proposal that the president would support, obviously,\" Earnest said in response to a reporter's question. \"I think we would evaluate these individual proposals on the merits before we make a final decision. I wouldn't want to hazard a guess at this point.\"\n\n>>> Government Shutdown Not Necessary to Block Obama Action on Illegal Immigrants, Republicans Say\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue - and many others,\" House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said today in a prepared statement.\n\nRepublicans who are open to immigration reform insist Congress should have a say in changing the system.\n\n\"President Obama's promised executive action and his refusal to work with Congress isn't just legally and constitutionally problematic -- it will also ultimately hurt the millions of legal and illegal immigrants who need real, lasting immigration reform,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a member of the \"Gang of Eight\" that crafted the Senate-passed immigration reform bill last year that House Republicans rejected. Hatch added:\n\nThe president rightly recognized as recently as last year that 'there is a path to get this done and that is through Congress.' Republicans have demonstrated a willingness to work constructively towards permanent reforms. But rather than work with Congress, the president has instead chosen to foster mistrust, polarization and gridlock.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson confirmed today in an appearance at the National Press Club that Obama would act soon on his position that he has legal authority to work around Congress to reshape the immigration system. Johnson said:\n\nAs the president has said many times, legislative action is always preferable. But we've waited now for years for Congress to act. And Congress has not acted. In the meantime, we've identified a number of executive actions that we can take within our existing legal authority to fix what everyone recognizes is a broken immigration system.\n\nObama's executive action was expected to allow many parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents to obtain work documents.\n\n>>> Looks Like Obama Is Going Big on Immigration. Now What?\n\nObama also will likely expand the criteria for his 2012 DACA program, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which delayed deportation of those who were brought unlawfully to America as children.\n\nJohnson said the executive action will include an effort to beef up security at the nation's southern border.\n\nObama also was expected to increase opportunities for immigrants who have high-tech skills.\n\nThe New York Times reported that illegal immigrants benefiting from Obama's plan will not be eligible for health benefits and other federal aid.",

I had promised.\"\n\n\"He was actually very proud that he's been able to keep his word,\" Wong said.\n\nAt least some of the estimated 5 million illegal immigrants who would be spared from deportation are also expected to be made eligible for work permits. But the eligible immigrants would not be entitled to federal benefits -- including health care tax credits -- under the plan, administration officials said Wednesday.\n\nLate Wednesday, the United Farm Workers announced that Obama had told union President Arturo Rodriguez that at least 250,000 unionized farm workers would be eligible for deportation relief, with at least half that eligible number based in California.\n\nThe president in 2012 used executive action to delay deportation for some of the millions of young people brought the U.S. illegally by their parents.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has warned Obama that taking executive action on the immigration issue before January would be tantamount to \"playing with fire.\"\n\nAnd on Wednesday before the announcement, Boehner aide Michael Steel referred to the president and attempt to govern alone as \"Emperor Obama.\"\n\nThe Democrat-controlled Senate last year passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration-reform legislation.

(Screenshot/White House video)\n\nPresident Barack Obama will announce on Thursday his long-awaited executive actions on immigration that will expand relief from deportation to millions of undocumented immigrants, according to a video released by the White House on Wednesday.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" the president says in the video. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long, and so what I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nThe president will make the official announcement at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday night via the White House website. It will be followed by an event at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas on Friday where the president is expected to rally support. The high school is the same place where Obama gave a major immigration reform speech in January 2013.\n\nSEE ALSO: Dreamers to Obama: Don't leave our parents behind\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, whose department made recommendations to Obama on what actions he can take on immigration, confirmed Wednesday that Obama will make his announcement \"in the coming day.\"\n\n\"I'll say one thing about executive actions: I do not, I will not get out ahead of the president and the announcement that he will make in the coming days,\" Johnson said speaking at a National Press Club event, according to MSNBC.\n\nObama's immigration plan could include protecting up to 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and allowing them to apply for work permits. It's almost certain that parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents will qualify for relief. What's unclear is whether or not the parents of Dreamers -- many of whom are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- will also qualify.\n\nShortly after news broke that Obama is planning to announce his long-awaited executive actions, Republicans voiced their opposition.\n\nAmong them were Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. They sent a letter to Obama, demanding that he \"abandon\" his plan for executive action.\n\n\"Instead of proceeding with ill-advised executive action, we implore you to work with Congress to enact legislation to address our broken immigration system,\" they wrote in the letter to Obama. \"We strongly urge you to respect the Constitution and abandon any unconstitutional, unilateral executive actions on immigration.\"\n\nMeanwhile, immigration advocates celebrated the news and called on supporters to \"get ready\" to voice how the president's actions will transform the lives of millions of people through a new campaign called \"OurHome.\"\n\nSEE ALSO: Republicans looking for ways to stop Obama on immigration\n\nRep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) also celebrated the news and pressed Obama to go big. He joined a group of farm, food and commercial workers at a Thanksgiving feast near the White House on Wednesday as a way to remind Americans of the workers behind the Thanksgiving meal. They also called on Obama to deliver \"the most inclusive changes\" to immigration policy possible via executive action.\n\n\"It makes no sense to exclude them from relief,\" Gutierrez said about workers.",

Deportation protection would extend to the parents and spouses of US citizens and permanent residents who have been in the United States for several years.\n\nObama is also expected to expand a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) which shields young immigrants from deportation.

The goal is to \"make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nLooming showdown\n\nCongressional Republicans -who won majorities in both houses in recent elections - are vehemently opposed to Obama's proposed unilateral immigration action, decrying such a move as \"amnesty,\" and claiming it will poison any chance for bipartisan cooperation.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue and many others,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan, the leading Republican voice on fiscal policy and a possible 2016 presidential candidate, called Obama's planned move, \"a partisan bomb.\"\n\n\"Under the Constitution, no president can go it alone without consequences,\" number two Senate Republican John Cornyn said.\n\nBut Republicans are divided on how best to respond to Obama's long-awaited action.\n\nSome conservatives, such as Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, have advocated fighting any potential immigration executive order by imposing funding restrictions in must-pass spending bills - a move that could potentially lead to a government shutdown.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham, an architect of a landmark immigration bill that passed the Senate but died in the House, urged caution.\n\n\"You can't capitulate, but you need to push back smartly,\" he said. \"If you overreact, then it becomes about us and not about President Obama.\"\n\nImmigration decree a sharp reversal\n\nAs Obama prepares to unveil his executive orders, he has drawn criticism for apparently contradicting his own prior statements on executive authority as regards immigration policy.\n\n\"The problem is, is that I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed,\" Obama declared in February 2013, responding to a young activist who begged him to halt deportations that were separating families.\n\nAnd in September of last year, Obama told Spanish language broadcaster Telemundo, that he could not act alone to broaden the deportation protection he enacted for young immigrants brought illegally to the US as children.\n\n\"if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option,\" Obama said.\n\nMajority opposed to executive overhaul\n\nPublic opinion polling found more Americans opposed to an executive order to overhaul immigration than in favor. A joint poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal found 48 percent would prefer Obama not to act unilaterally to overhaul the immigration system, while 38 percent supported such a move. 14 percent had no opinion or were unsure.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- In a broad test of his executive powers, President Barack Obama declared Wednesday he will sidestep Congress and order his own federal action on immigration -- in measures that could spare from deportation as many as 5 million people illegally in the U.S. and set up one of the most pitched partisan confrontations of his presidency.\n\nObama declared that Washington has allowed America's immigration problem \"to fester for too long.\"\n\nThe president will use an 8 p.m. EST address Thursday to announce his measures and will sign the executive actions during a rally in Las Vegas on Friday. In doing so, Obama will be taking an aggressive stand that he had once insisted was beyond his presidential power.\n\nAs many as 5 million people in the country illegally are likely to be protected from deportation and made eligible for work permits under the plan. They would not have a path to citizenship, however, and the actions could be reversed by a new president in two years. Officials said the eligible immigrants would not be entitled to federal benefits -- including health care tax credits -- under Obama's plan.\n\nThe 5 million estimate includes extending deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for five years. The president also is likely to expand his 2-year-old program that protects young immigrants from deportation. The administration had considered extending the executive action to parents of young immigrants covered under the 2012 Obama directive, but immigration advocates said they did not expect the parents to be included in the final plan.\n\n\"What I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem,\" Obama said in a video on Facebook.\n\nLaying the groundwork for his actions, Obama invited 18 Democratic members of the House and Senate -- but no Republicans -- to dinner at the White House on Wednesday. Among the networks airing his Thursday speech will be Univision, which will interrupt the Latin Grammys to carry his remarks, assuring him a huge Spanish-speaking audience. The major broadcast networks -- ABC, CBS and NBC -- were not planning to air the speech, but cable news networks were.\n\nObama is to speak at Las Vegas' Del Sol High School on Friday, a school with a large population of non-English speaking students where Obama unveiled his blueprint for comprehensive immigration legislation in 2013.\n\nRepublicans vehemently oppose the president's likely actions but are deeply divided and have spent much of the week intensely debating how to respond. Some conservative members have threatened to pursue a government shutdown and one -- two-term Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama -- raised the specter of impeachment on Wednesday.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner's spokesman criticized Obama's planned announcement, noting that the president himself had said in the past that he was not \"emperor\" and was limited in his ability to act.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" the spokesman, Michael Steel, said.\n\nA wide-ranging immigration bill passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the Republican-led House. Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday took turns declaring their support for Obama's unilateral action, blaming Republican inaction for forcing Obama to act.\n\n\"There's one more chance: Just put the bill on the floor, Speaker Boehner,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a lead author of the bill that passed the Senate. \"Pass the bill and we will not even have to debate executive action.\"\n\nEven Republicans who supported the Senate bill that would have overhauled immigration laws said Obama's go-it-alone approach would backfire. Still, they cautioned their party colleagues not to overreach in their response.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who worked on the Senate legislation, said the executive actions would leave the status of millions of immigrants unresolved and would not address what he called a broken immigration system.\n\n\"Our response has to be measured -- can't capitulate, can't overreact,\" he said. \"Impeachment or shutting down the entire government would be an unwise move.\"\n\nAdjustments also are expected to a 2012 program that allowed immigrants under 31 who had arrived before June 2007 to apply for a reprieve from deportation and a work permit. More than 600,000 young immigrants have been shielded from deportation to date under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Removing the upper age limit so that applicants don't have to be under 31 -- one option under consideration -- would make an additional 200,000 people eligible.\n\nIn one specific example, about 250,000 farm workers in the United States illegally would receive work permits under Obama's actions, according to Giev Kashkooli, the national political legislative director of the United Farm Workers who met with White House officials and with Obama on Wednesday. The UFW had been hoping for a specific program that would provide work permits to more farm workers.",

Unfortunately Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long,\" Obama said. \"So what' I'm going to be laying out is the things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nAccording to a senior Democrat familiar with the plans, Obama will announce on Thursday that he is providing temporary protections to up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. His orders will make up to 4 million undocumented immigrants eligible for temporary protective status and provide relief to another 1 million through other means.\n\nIn a blow to activists advocating on behalf of young immigrant families, there will be no guaranteed protections for the parents of so-called Dreamers -- children protected by Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program -- nor for immigrant agricultural workers, said the Democrat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nObama has invited senior lawmakers to the White House for dinner Wednesday night so that he can explain his plans to use executive authority to change the nation's immigration laws, according to several congressional aides.\n\nOnly Democratic leaders -- Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and the leaders of the congressional Asian, Black and Hispanic caucuses -- were asked to come to the meeting, said the aides, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz said Wednesday that Obama will \"no doubt threaten a shutdown\" with his upcoming executive action on immigration.\n\n\"[T]hat seems to be the one card he repeatedly plays -- but Congress can authorize funding for agencies of government one at a time,\" Cruz (Tex.) wrote in an op-ed published in Politico Magazine. \"If the President is unwilling to accepting [sic] funding for, say, the Department of Homeland Security without his being able to unilaterally defy the law, he alone will be responsible for the consequences.\"\n\nOther leading congressional Republicans pleaded with their colleagues Wednesday to tread carefully, underscoring the mounting concerns among party officials over the simmering outrage from conservative lawmakers and its political consequences, particularly with the Hispanic community.\n\n\"Republicans have to handle this in a sensitive way,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). He warned that any Republican who speaks of impeaching the president over immigration would be shunned by most Republicans and \"considered pretty erratic and pretty excessive.\"\n\nTwo Republicans who are mulling presidential bids, Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Rob Portman (Ohio), also cautioned their colleagues to focus on fighting the policy, rather than on fiery rebuttals that could alienate the voters the party is seeking to win over ahead of the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Pass some things,\" Paul said, when asked about how the party should react. He suggested an expansion of work visas as an example of one potential piece of legislation that could highlight Republicans' commitment to addressing immigration issues and to governing. \"I think we can still do some good things. I think we have to fight him that way,\" he said.\n\n\"No one in our leadership team is interested in shutting down the government,\" Portman said. \"Many of us believe the immigration system is broken and we'd like to fix it, and we'd like to work with the president on that.\"\n\nSaid outgoing National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Sen. Jerry Moran (Kan.): \"It's important for us to have an agenda that's positive for the country.\"\n\nBut several conservatives seemed to shrug off the guidance and said any anger from fellow Republicans and grass-roots activists was justified. They added that they would likely push to use an upcoming government spending bill as a way of countering the president by defunding related immigration programs.\n\n\"This is presidential overreach of monumental proportions,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \"It's a direct erosion of congressional power. .\u2009.\u2009. I think Congress needs to and will resist and do so in a way that is responsible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats closely watched the unfolding Republican scene, sensing that their beleaguered party could score political points if the GOP response was seen as over-the-top by some voters.\n\n\"The road to the White House comes through the [Hispanic] community in critical states,\" said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). \"Unless Republicans do that, they're in trouble.\"\n\nObama said he will travel to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas Friday, where he will discuss and rally support for his plan.\n\nAdvocates began preparing events to promote the administration's immigration policy.\n\n\"We hear there will be a prime time Thursday evening announcement [to preview] and full unveiling in Vegas on Friday,\" immigration advocate Dawn Le told other activists in an e-mail, which was later inadvertently sent to a group of reporters Wednesday morning. \"Can folks begin to work and plan watch parties for Thursday and/or Friday? Unclear whether Thursday night content will be what is 'celebratory,' but Friday will be where we need a lot of energy guaranteed.\"\n\nObama launched his push for immigration reform in January 2013 in Las Vegas, outlining a plan that would allow many of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants to earn citizenship.\n\nThe president's decision to speak at the city's Del Sol High School highlights the administration's intensified push to convince Latinos that the Democratic Party is committed to addressing the dilemma of millions of undocumented immigrants. Obama is preparing to use his executive authority to expand temporary protections to millions of these individuals, as well as to broaden visa programs for highly skilled technology workers and perhaps also stiffen security along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nDuring an appearance at the National Press Club Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Obama will announce \"in the coming days .\u2009.\u2009. [a] set of comprehensive reforms, within our existing legal authorities, to fix our broken immigration system.\"\n\nHe did not specify the actions Obama will take but did say they will include steps to further secure the southwestern border of the United States. Administration lawyers have concluded that executive action on the issue is legal and within the president's authority, he said, despite intense opposition from Republicans.\n\n\"Legislative action is always preferable,\" Johnson said. \"But we have waited for Congress to act, and the Congress has not acted. The president has waited.\"\n\nJohnson said the administration has concluded it has \"wide latitude\" to take action. \"It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system,\" he said. \"And we will.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans have warned Obama that he risks undermining the prospects for cooperation on legislation in the final two years of his presidency if he takes action on immigration.\n\nThe decision to speak in Las Vegas could also bolster the political standing of Reid, who said in an interview with Univision on Tuesday that when it came to expanding protections for undocumented immigrants, \"I think it should be done now.\"\n\nAli Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, wrote in an e-mail that even as Obama acted on his own to break the stalemate on the issue, Republicans would still have a chance to legislate.\n\n\"While executive action is not ideal, it accomplishes four things: Stabilizes our workforce, prioritizes law enforcement, protects families and puts congressional Republicans in the driver's seat going into 2015,\" Noorani wrote. \"They have an incredible opportunity to get credit for fixing America's immigration system.\"\n\nWith Obama likely on the verge of making an announcement, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend funding for the federal government, which is set to expire next month, even if the president moves to overhaul the immigration system and some conservatives call for a spending showdown.\n\nBut in a sign that the GOP strategy is still being formulated, McConnell did not specify the framework and length of possible funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House and Senate are still mulling a variety of options, all while hoping to avoid a politically damaging shutdown.\n\n\"We have two goals here at the end of the session: fund the government and avoid retroactive tax increases. I'm confident that we'll do both,\" McConnell said in a brief exchange at the Capitol.\n\nOther congressional Republicans warned again that Obama risks his relationship with a GOP-controlled Capitol Hill if he acts.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said in an e-mail.\n\nIn an effort to cast doubts on the legality of Obama's decision, GOP aides have been circulating a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn't believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.\n\nTom Hamburger, Jerry Markon and Robert Costa contributed to this report.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama will outline a plan on Thursday to relax U.S. immigration policy for as many as 5 million people, bypassing Congress and angering Republicans.\n\nU.S. Representative Paul Ryan, the leading Republican voice on fiscal policy and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, called the plan a \"partisan bomb\" while a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner branded the president \"Emperor Obama\" for acting unilaterally.\n\nThe White House said Obama will deliver a televised speech at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday (0100 GMT Friday) laying out the plan followed by a trip to Las Vegas on Friday. Nevada is home to the highest proportion of undocumented immigrants.\n\nFrustrated by years of congressional inaction on what most in Washington agree is a broken immigration system, Obama said he is now prepared to use his executive authority.\n\nObama's directives are expected to remove the threat of deportation for as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States.\n\nThe decision will cement his legacy as having aided Hispanics who helped elect him in 2008 and who have become increasingly vocal in their frustration that he has failed to live up to his promise to enact immigration reform.\n\nThe unilateral overhaul will likely have a ripple effect on the campaign to find a successor to the president in 2016. While Hispanics will no doubt be pleased, Democrats could face a backlash from voters.\n\nReaction was swift from Republicans who took control of the Senate in Nov. 4 elections and strengthened their grip on the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile liberal Democrats were thrilled at Obama's decision to move ahead, some moderate voices in Obama's party were uneasy.\n\n\"I wish he wouldn't do it,\" said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \"I just wish he wouldn't do it.\"\n\nObama will host 18 congressional Democrats at the White House to consolidate support for his immigration plans among his closest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have threatened to fight the immigration move by imposing funding restrictions in a must-pass spending bill, which could conceivably lead to a government shutdown.\n\nRepublican leaders, however, have stressed they will not allow a shutdown after facing heavy criticism for the last one a year ago.\n\nHouse Republicans are weighing a range of responses to register their disapproval.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue and many others,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nFor a president known for having deported thousands of illegal migrants, the actions he will take mark a dramatic shift in course, although advocacy groups will argue that he should go even further in protecting more people who work low-paying jobs that many American citizens prefer not to do.\n\nSources close to the administration said Obama is planning to issue a reprieve from deportation that will cover some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.\n\nThat initiative would expand on a 2012 executive order by the president that gave relief from deportation and work permits to undocumented children brought to the United States by their parents.\n\nThere is also expected to be a border security element and Obama will act to help companies hire and retain high-skilled workers from abroad, the sources said.\n\nObama's move is his most defiant step yet in reaction to the elections handing control of the Senate to Republicans. The new political order in Washington will test Obama's ability to make compromises with his opponents.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 48 percent would prefer Obama not act on his own, while 38 percent support it and 14 percent had no opinion or were unsure.\n\nThe last major immigration overhaul that expanded the number of legal migrants was in 1986 through legislation signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. An attempt by President George W. Bush in 2007 for immigration reform failed.\n\nIt is not out of the question that Obama early next year could offer to approve the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline from Canada in exchange for a deal on immigration legislation.\n\nDespite claims that Obama may overstep his executive powers, Stephen Legomsky, a former U.S. immigration official who is now a professor at Washington University law school, said the president's planned action appeared to fit well within the bounds of established law and prosecutorial discretion.",

                    "body": "(Updates with Obama, Republican comment starting in third paragraph.)\n\nNov. 19 (Bloomberg) --\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will outline in a television speech Thursday night his plan to give between 4 million and 5 million undocumented immigrants a reprieve from deportation.\n\nObama's executive actions would give temporary visas to undocumented immigrants whose children were born in the United States, according to people familiar with the proposal. The plan would expand eligibility for his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has given protection to 600,000 child immigrants.\n\nObama, in a White House video posted Wednesday, said his speech Thursday at 8 p.m. Washington time will explain how he's tacking an issue that's been allowed \"to fester far too long.\" He'll then fly on Nov. 21 to Las Vegas to discuss his immigration actions at a school, the president said.\n\nThe planned action, which the White House says is a partial fix for the U.S. immigration system, may improve Obama's standing with Hispanics after he presided over a record number of deportations and damage his chances of working with Republicans in Congress on other policy matters.\n\nThe idea behind his strategy is to cover categories of immigrants that would be politically difficult for Republicans to oppose, because that would involve separating parents from their children, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the matter.\n\nAnna Navarro, former chief Hispanic adviser to Arizona Sen. John McCain, said Republicans \"need to resist the urge of taking their toys and going home from the playground because Obama stuck his tongue out at them.\" A fight over keeping parents with their children won't be a winning political argument for Republicans, she said.\n\nBy centering his plan on family unification, Obama is seeking to drive a wedge in the Republican Party, which includes members who support what the president is doing even if they oppose his use of presidential powers to achieve it.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said Obama was abusing his power and instead should have worked with Republicans.\n\n\"There is nobody who's abused the authority to issue executive orders more than the current occupant of the White House,\" he said. Obama is undermining Republican support for \"common-sense immigration bills,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said Obama was behaving as an \"emperor\" and ignoring the will of the people. \"He will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in an email.\n\nIn an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday, 48 percent of Americans oppose Obama taking executive action on immigration while 38 percent support it. About 14 percent have no opinion or are unsure. The poll was conducted Nov. 14-17 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nObama will also expand a program that gives work permits for up to 29 months to foreign graduates of U.S. universities with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math, according to the people, who requested anonymity before a formal announcement. That provides more workers to fill high-tech jobs.\n\nThe administration already broadened eligibility for the program in 2012 by increasing the qualifying fields of study.\n\nThe executive action will include enforcement measures and changes to legal-immigration procedures, the people said.\n\nThe president's action is expected to stop short of including the parents of children brought to the U.S. illegally, called Dreamers, the people said. Senate Democrats were pressing the White House to cover this group under the current plan.\n\nRepublicans are vowing to try to block the executive action, arguing that it's an unconstitutional power grab that will poison the environment for bipartisan compromise in the new Congress, which they will control.\n\nA group of at least 60 House Republicans is pushing to use a government funding bill to deny the president the money needed to implement his plan. Congress must approve funds by Dec. 11 to keep the government open or risk an interruption similar to last year, when Republican demands to defund the president's health- care law led to a 16-day partial shutdown.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have been urging the president to be bold with his plan. They cite the failure of the Republican-led House to take up a bill the Senate passed last year with bipartisan support creating a path to citizenship for many of the nation's estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants.\n\nRepublicans are split on the immigration issue generally. Some say the party must take steps to ease its stance against undocumented immigrants while others consider them lawbreakers who don't deserve what many of them label amnesty.\n\nNational demographic shifts, particularly in competitive states such as Nevada and Florida, make the support of Hispanic voters critical to both political parties.\n\nRepublicans have already begun to temper some of their threats over shutting down the government to stop Obama.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Boehner and his allies said they're reviewing alternatives to using a funding bill to fight the executive action, including retroactively canceling money in 2015 for any action taken by Obama.\n\nRepublican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Boehner ally, said many members \"understand what was done in October of last year is not the appropriate way going forward.\" Court challenges also are a possibility, he said.\n\n\"The conference is trying to be a lot more thoughtful,\" Cole said. \"Our aim is to shut down what the president is doing, not to shut down the government.\"\n\nThe White House began sharing policy and messaging plans yesterday with outside groups and Democrats on Capitol Hill. In addition to arguing that Obama has the legal authority to revamp the immigration system, the White House says Congress can step in at any time with legislation.\n\n\"There is a very simple solution to the perception that somehow the president is exercising too much executive authority, and that's for Congress to pass a bipartisan bill to permanently fix the system,\" according to White House talking points, which were obtained by Bloomberg.\n\n\"If they get that done, the president looks forward to signing it into law -- superseding the actions he's taken on his own to fix as much of the system as he can.\"\n\nThe number of people who would be protected from prosecution depends on how the executive action is structured and whether it requires the undocumented parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have been in the country for five years or 10 years to qualify.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will announce his intention today to use his executive powers to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, the most significant presidential intervention to alter the U.S. immigration system in nearly three decades.\n\nUsing a rare prime-time address from the White House, Mr. Obama hopes to build public support for his decision to remake border control laws without approval from Congress, a move likely to spark a major political fight about the limits of presidential power. Mr. Obama will provide more details at a rally Friday with immigration advocates in Las Vegas as the White House begins a campaign to mobilize grass-roots support for the effort.\n\nMr. Obama is expected to announce measures that would make as many as 4 million immigrants eligible for temporary protected status and provide relief to another 1 million through other means, according to people briefed on the plans. He also will take steps to expand visas for high-tech workers; modify federal immigrant detention procedures; and add resources to strengthen security at the border, they said.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Mr. Obama said in a brief video released on his Facebook page Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long.\"\n\nBut even as he moved to address an old problem, Mr. Obama created a new political tempest on Capitol Hill, where Republicans quickly denounced his actions less than two weeks after voters handed the GOP full control Congress.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, referred to the president as \"Emperor Obama\" and charged that he was exceeding his constitutional authority and cementing \"his legacy of lawlessness.\" Several GOP members suggested using a government spending bill next month to counter Mr. Obama's move by defunding related immigration programs, setting up the potential for a government shutdown.\n\n\"This is presidential overreach of monumental proportions,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \"It's a direct erosion of congressional power. . . . I think Congress needs to and will resist and do so in a way that is responsible.\"\n\nThe showdown comes two years after Mr. Obama, flush off his 2012 re-election, announced that he would pursue a legislative overhaul of immigration laws as he sought to fulfill a campaign promise to Latino and Asian American supporters who were frustrated that the president had not done more to resolve immigration concerns during his first term.\n\nBut an 18-month effort to pass legislation, which included a path to citizenship, collapsed this summer in the face of strenuous opposition in the Republican-controlled House. In June, Mr. Obama promised to act aggressively on the problem in areas where the law allowed use of his executive authority. Administration lawyers have spent months reviewing case law and meeting with immigration advocates, law enforcement officials and legal experts to develop options for Mr. Obama, who reviewed them with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.\n\nUnder his plan, Mr. Obama will provide administrative relief to illegal-immigrant parents of children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, an adult population that reaches an estimated 3.46 million, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. But the president's order also will require the parents to have lived in the United States for a certain number of years -- likely 10. The average illegal immigrants has lived in the country for 13 years.\n\nMany of those who receive administrative relief also would be eligible to apply for work permits.\n\nThe president also is expected to expand a 2012 program that has deferred deportations of nearly 600,000 younger immigrants known as \"dreamers\" who were brought into the country illegally as children. Mr. Obama's plans would expand that program by raising the maximum current age from 30 and raising the maximum arrival age above 16. But it is not known how many years of eligibility he will add at either end, or how many more people would be covered.\n\nMr. Obama will stop short of extending protections to hundreds of thousands of parents of the dreamers, after the White House Office of Legal Counsel determined that doing so would exceed the president's legal authorities to act unilaterally, according to the people briefed on the plans.\n\nAbout 671,000 parents live with illegal-immigrant children, and 6.5 million live with no children at all -- meaning that most of them are unlikely to be eligible for deportation relief, although some might qualify under other potential changes, including if they serve in the U.S. military.\n\n\"Even if they help 5 million people, a lot of others will be left out, but it is still a huge step forward and an historic decision. It is one of the biggest victories we've ever had,\" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a national immigrant advocacy group based in Washington. Despite its limits, Mr. Sharry said Mr. Obama's executive action \"could well be a turning point from a decade of ramping up enforcement to a more balanced approach, where protection of immigrants is combined with enforcement against bad actors.\"\n\nWhite House officials declined to provide details about the president's announcement, but Mr. Johnson called the president's plan \"comprehensive.\" The Homeland Security secretary and other administration officials emphasized that Mr. Obama remains supportive of Congress' undertaking a broader legislative fix to immigration laws next year. \"Legislative action is always preferable,\" Mr. Johnson said Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington. \"But we have waited for Congress to act, and the Congress has not acted. It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system. And we will.\"\n\nFor Republicans, the confrontation represents the first test of GOP leaders' ability to calibrate their political strategy after the party's successes in the midterm elections. While some members appear eager for a fight with the White House, others cautioned that the party should tread carefully, underscoring Republican officials' mounting concerns over simmering outrage among conservative lawmakers and its political consequences, particularly within the Hispanic community.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend the federal government's funding, which is set to expire next month. And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, \"Republicans have to handle this in a sensitive way.\" He warned that any Republican who speaks of impeaching the president over immigration would be shunned by most Republicans and \"considered pretty erratic and pretty excessive.\"\n\nIn an effort to cast doubt on the legality of Mr. Obama's decision, GOP aides circulated a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn't believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.\n\nTwo Republicans mulling presidential bids, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rob Portman of Ohio, urged colleagues to focus on fighting the policy, rather than on fiery rebuttals that could alienate voters the party hopes to win over ahead of the 2016 campaign. \"Pass some things,\" Mr. Paul said, when asked about how the party should react. He suggested an expansion of work visas as an example of one potential piece of legislation that could highlight a GOP commitment to addressing immigration issues and governing. \"We can still do some good things. I think we have to fight him that way.\"\n\nThe White House, recognizing the political risks, moved to shore up public support with an aggressive sales job. By Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Obama's Facebook video had been watched more than 1.7 million times.\n\nHis prime-time address Thursday also is aimed to include \"as many people across the country in this broader debate,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. However, most of the major television networks announced that they will not carry the remarks live, leaving it to cable news channels and the Spanish-language network Univision, where Mr. Obama's remarks will coincide with the Latin Grammy Awards broadcast.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Obama will return to Las Vegas' Del Sol High School, which holds a special significance for him. On Jan. 11, 2008, then-Sen. Obama arrived in that city after a humiliating defeat by then-New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in New Hampshire's presidential primary.\n\nMr. Obama pivoted to the heavily Latino voting bloc of Nevadans and delivered what became known as his \"Si Se Puede!\" speech -- the Spanish equivalent of \"Yes, We Can!\" At the high school that day, hundreds filled the gymnasium, and hundreds more waited outside, as the president vowed to deliver on citizenship for undocumented immigrants.",

Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois, told CNN Wednesday that Obama is \"overstepping his power.\" Kinzinger said Obama's action would reduce the likelihood of successful immigration reform efforts in 2015 between Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nKinzinger said he is afraid that \"this whole situation is going to collapse\" if Obama acts unilaterally and suggested a better step would be for Obama to give Congress until March to pass an immigration bill.\n\nObama posted a minute-long video on his Facebook page where he said, while sitting on his desk in the Oval Office, that he would be announcing his proposal in a speech and then visit Del Sol High School where he previously laid out principles for immigration reform.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long,\" Obama said.\n\nObama said the plan will encompass steps he can take within his \"lawful authority as president\" while he continues to work with Congress on a bipartisan solution \"to solve the entire problem.\"\n\nAt the press briefing, Earnest said the president's plan would help \"repair our broken immigration system.\" He said Obama faced a decision between taking action on immigration or waiting \"interminably\" for agreement on a bill in Congress.\n\nDeclining to rule out other events and trips by the president to talk about his plan, Earnest said he expects a \"rather lengthy discussion\" about the topic.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill in the summer of 2013, Earnest said, and the White House has been waiting for that bill to surface in the Republican-controlled U.S. House. Earnest said he believes that bill would pass with bipartisan support if voted upon.\n\nThe White House on Thursday also plans to release materials backing up the legal underpinnings of his executive action.\n\n\"It's consistent with actions taken by presidents of both parties to deal with the immigration system,\" Earnest said.",

Photo: Reuters\n\nWashington: Up to 4 million undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least five years can apply for a program that protects them from deportation and allows those with no criminal record to work legally in the country, US President Barack Obama will announce, according to people briefed on his plans.\n\nAn additional 1 million people will get protection from deportation through other parts of Mr Obama's plan to overhaul the United States' immigration enforcement system, including the expansion of an existing program for \"Dreamers,\" young immigrants who came to the US as children. There will no longer be a limit on the age of the people who qualify.\n\nBut farmworkers will not receive specific protection from deportation, nor will the Dreamers' parents. And none of the 5 million immigrants overall who will be given new legal protections will get government subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThese details about Mr Obama's planned executive action on immigration emerged as he prepared to speak to the nation in a prime-time address on Thursday night, local time. On Friday Mr Obama is to travel to Las Vegas to rally public support for his plan in a state where Hispanics are a growing and politically powerful constituency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a video posted on the White House website Mr Obama said that he would deliver the 8pm speech from the White House to announce \"steps that I can take to start fixing our broken immigration system\".\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Mr Obama said in the video. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long. What I'm going to be laying out is things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nMr Obama has said for months that he would act to revamp the nation's immigration enforcement system if Republicans continued to block a legislative overhaul that would enhance border security, increase legal immigration and provide a path to legalisation for many of the 11 million people living illegally in the United States.\n\nWhite House officials have said the president remains open to signing a legislative overhaul if Republicans relent, but they said his patience had run out. By taking action now, Mr Obama is daring the Republicans, who will take over control of Congress in January, to try to stand in the way of change that is favoured by many in the growing, politically powerful Latino constituency.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill sharply rebuked the president for his executive actions even before the speech on Thursday, accusing him of vastly exceeding the authority of his office.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner and other top Republicans have vowed to try to overturn the president's actions, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, in an opinion article on the Politico website, assailed the president for embracing \"the tactics of a monarch\".\n\nBut the party has been split about whether to threaten a government shutdown or an impeachment proceeding if Mr Obama moved ahead with unilateral action.\n\nAt the same time, immigration advocates rallied behind Mr Obama's actions, describing them as a much-delayed victory for millions of people.\n\nNew York Times",

                    "body": "President Obama is poised Thursday to announce a series of unilateral actions on immigration that Republicans warn could set off a constitutional crisis.\n\nObama has said he will take a series of steps to change the immigration system that will reportedly included a sweeping expansion of a deferred action program that allows illegal immigrants to remain in the United States.\n\nAs recently as the fall of 2013, the president was warning activists that he's not an \"emperor\" who can act without Congress.\n\nThe White House insists Obama's position hasn't changed, and that the disparity is a matter of emphasis.\n\nBut now that Obama is going it alone, Republicans are throwing his words back against him, with a spokesman to Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) on Wednesday dubbing him \"Emperor Obama\" on the eve of his immigration announcement.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement.\n\nHere's a look at how Obama has addressed the question of executive action on immigration over time:\n\nOctober 25, 2010: Obama in the fall of 2010 was under intense pressure to take action on immigration from advocacy groups, particularly on behalf of people who were brought to the United States illegally as children.\n\nObama pushed back on those calls in an interview with Univision.\n\n\"My Cabinet has been working very hard on trying to get it done, but ultimately, I think somebody said the other day, I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself,\" he said.\n\nMarch 29, 2011: Pressed by activists at a town hall, Obama again insists he cannot act alone to ease deportations. \"With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case,\" he said.\n\nJune 15, 2012: In the heat of his reelection campaign, Obama in the summer of 2012 announced the creation of a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows some younger illegal immigrants to gain temporary legal status. Obama said he was acting to \"lift the shadow of deportation from these young people.\"\n\nJan. 30, 2013: After his reelection, activists began pressing Obama to go even further without Congress by halting all deportations of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.\n\nIn an interview with Univision's radio network, Obama said, \"Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I'm not a king.\" But he also said that he had some leeway in how in applied immigration law, citing the deferred action program.\n\nFeb. 14, 2013: Obama declares he's not \"emperor of the United States\" when pressed about immigration during a Google Hangout.\n\n\"The problem is that I'm the president of the United States, I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed,\" Obama said.\n\nSeptember 17, 2013: The president cites the role of Congress on immigration policy in an interview with Telemundo.\n\n\"My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said, here's the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement,\" he said.\n\nJune 30, 2014: After Boehner declares that the House cannot move forward on an immigration reform bill due to distrust of the president, Obama vows to take action.\n\n\"If Congress will not do its job, at least we can do ours,\" he said.\n\nAugust 6, 2014: As Obama begins a review of possible administrative actions, he defends using his power to change the immigration system.\n\n\"The American people don't want me standing around twiddling my thumbs waiting for Congress to do something,\" Obama said.\n\nHe said the White House was \"going to make sure every time we take one of these steps we are working within the confines of my executive power.\"\n\nSeptember 9, 2014: With tough midterm races looming for Democrats in several key states, Obama delays his immigration orders until after the election.\n\nObama explained his decision in an interview on NBC, arguing that the political perception of the issue changed because of the surge of unaccompanied minors over the southern border during the summer.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem,\" he said. \"I want to spend some time, even as we're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we're doing this, why it's the right thing for the American people, why it's the right thing for the American economy.\"\n\nNovember 16, 2014: With rumors swirling that his immigration order was imminent, Obama defends his approach at a press conference in Brisbane.\n\n\"There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws,\" he said, before noting that the immigration system was strapped for resources.\n\n\"And so what's within our authority to do in reallocating resources and reprioritizing since we can't do everything. And it's on that basis that I'll be making a decision about any executive actions that I might take,\" he said.\n\n\"I will repeat what I have said before: There is a very simple solution to this perception that somehow I'm exercising too much executive authority. Pass a bill I can sign on this issue.\"",

                    "body": "While President Obama appears on the verge of using executive authority to provide temporary administrative relief for as many as five million undocumented immigrants, there was a time when he seemed very intent on making clear that he didn't have the authority to do so:\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Obama is poised to ignore stark warnings that executive action on immigration would amount to \"violating our laws\" and would be \"very difficult to defend legally.\"\n\nThose warnings came not from Republican lawmakers but from Mr. Obama himself.\n\nFor years, he has waved aside the demands of Latino activists and Democratic allies who begged him to act on his own, and he insisted publicly that a decision to shield millions of immigrants from deportation without an act of Congress would amount to nothing less than the dictates of a king, not a president.\n\nIn a Telemundo interview in September 2013, Mr. Obama said he was proud of having protected the \"Dreamers\" -- people who came to the United States illegally as young children -- from deportation. But he also said that he could not apply that same action to other groups of people.\n\n\"If we start broadening that, then essentially I'll be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally,\" Mr. Obama told Jose Diaz-Balart in the interview. \"So that's not an option.\"\n\n(...)\n\nBut Mr. Obama is set to effectively reverse position from that statement and now says he believes that such actions can be \"legally unassailable,\" as a senior White House official put it last week. Mr. Obama is expected to announce plans soon to expand the program for Dreamers to shield up to five million people from deportation and provide work permits for many of them.\n\nThe president insisted over the weekend that he had not changed his position. During a news conference in Australia, he said that his earlier answers about the limits of his executive authority were prompted by people who asked him whether he could enact, by fiat, a bipartisan immigration bill that had passed the Senate, which would have provided a path to legalization for more of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants here.\n\n\"Getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities,\" Mr. Obama said Sunday. \"There are certain things I cannot do.\"\n\nIn fact, most of the questions that were posed to the president over the past several years were about the very thing that he is expected to announce within a matter of days: whether he could do something to reduce deportations and keep families together if Congress would not act.\n\nThe president was pressed on that very issue during a Google Hangout in February 2013. An activist asked whether he could do more to keep families from being \"broken apart\" while Congress remained gridlocked on immigration legislation.\n\n\"This is something that I have struggled with throughout my presidency,\" Mr. Obama said. \"The problem is, is that I'm the president of the United States, I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.\"\n\n(...)\n\nIn an immigration speech in San Francisco last November, protesters repeatedly interrupted the president, yelling, \"Stop deportations!\" Mr. Obama told the protesters that he respected their \"passion,\" but insisted that only Congress had the authority to do what they wanted.\n\n\"The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,\" he said. \"And what I'm proposing is the harder path.\"\n\nAnd at a Town Hall in March of 2011, months before taking action to keep the Dreamers from being deported, Mr. Obama said the nation's laws were clear enough \"that for me to simply, through executive order, ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president.\"\n\nJazz Shaw found several instances where President Obama said essentially the same thing:\n\nI believe it was the same one who said in 2010:\n\n\"I Believe Such An Indiscriminate Approach Would Be Both Unwise And Unfair. ... This Could Lead To A Surge In More Illegal Immigration.\"\n\nIn March of 2011:\n\n\"With Respect To The Notion That I Can Just Suspend Deportations Through Executive Order, That's Just Not The Case....\"\n\nIn September of that same year:\n\n\"I Just Have To Continue To Say This Notion That Somehow I Can Just Change The Laws Unilaterally Is Just Not True. We Are Doing Everything We Can Administratively.\"\n\nAnd just in March of this year...:\n\n\"Until Congress Passes A New Law, Then I Am Constrained In Terms Of What I Am Able To Do.\"\n\nObviously, when President Obama was making these statements his main purpose was to try to explain to supporters, and principally Latino voters who support immigration reform and were frustrated by a long history of inaction on the part of the Obama Administration and Democrats in Congress to act. In that regard, it's worth remembering that there was no significant action taken on immigration from during the two years that of the Obama Presidency that Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress notwithstanding the fact that promises of such action had been made to Latino voters and others that there would be something done about the issue. Indeed, it wasn't until Republicans took control of the House and made significant gains in the Senate in the 2010 elections that we began to see any legislative action at all on the issue, and it that case it started in the Senate where Democrats and Republicans such as Marco Rubio began to work together to pull together a bill that, at the very least could pass the Senate and, possibly, pass the House of Representatives as well. In the meantime, rather than pushing immigration reform for the first four years of his time in office, the President immigration policy was more concerned with increasing deportations at a pace that far outstripped those of the Bush Administration than it was with providing any kind of relief for undocumented immigrants, children who were brought here illegally by their parents, or the parents of children born in the United States who are, of course, American citizens by birth.\n\nGiven all of that, one has to wonder why it is that the President and Democrats in Congress didn't try to move forward on immigration reform before 2013. Yes, it's true that the threat of Republicans invoking cloture on such a bill was a real concern in the Senate, but that seems like something of a disingenuous argument for two reasons. First of all, the filibuster issue is only relevant in the Senate and would have obviously not been an issue in the House had an immigration bill been introduced and debate at any point between 2009 and 2011, except there's no record of any significant bills on this issue being pushed by the Democratic majority or advocated by the Administration. Second, when the Senate finally did take up an immigration bill in 2013, it ended up passing that body with sixty-eight votes, meaning that it had the support of not only every member of the Democratic Caucus, but also thirteen Republicans, the majority of whom were also members of the Senate between 2009 and 2011. Given that, it's not too hard to believe that a similar bill could have passed the Senate of the 111th Congress with more than enough votes to avoid cloture. That bill would have ended up on the President's desk, and it would have been signed into law. None of that happened, of course, and it wasn't until Republicans took control of the House that we saw Democrats try to move forward on immigration.\n\nOnce the Senate passed its immigration reform bill in 2013, of course, there was already much water under the bridge when it comes to the relationship between the parties on Capitol Hill, and the relationship between the Republicans in Congress and the President. Additionally, the influence of the Tea Party over the GOP had increased significantly, and the Tea Party had largely transformed into an organization that seemed more concerned with immigration and opposing anything the President supports than it did with the economic issues that were supposedly its founding motivation. Whatever the reason, though, and despite the fact that groups like the Chamber of Commerce and even religious groups have been pressuring the GOP to act on immigration reform, the prospect of getting any kind of reform done in the House became next to impossible. Additionally, the 2012 Republican primary fights put on rather unfortunate display the extent to which anti-immigration positions had led even otherwise level headed establishment Republicans like Mitt Romney to take extreme anti-immigration positions. The result, of course, was that the GOP got one of its lowest shares ever of the Latino vote in 2012, and signs continued to grow that the GOP could lose the Latino vote for a generation because of its stand on immigration.\n\nThe lack of progress on immigration, though, began to put pressure on the President to do something other than increase the levels of deportations to help an increasingly important part of the Democratic coalition. In 2012, the White House responded with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provided relief for a relatively small group of people who had been brought by their parents the United States illegally as children. When asked, however, why he couldn't do more, the President responded in the manner set forth above for more than two years, and argued that only the Republicans in the House could truly act to fix what was wrong with the immigration system. Looking at the White House's strategy from a distance, it seems as though they were more interested in backing Republicans into a corner on immigration than they were in helping the Latinos that they keep telling to vote Democratic. Now, suddenly, the President has seemingly discovered that that he does have the executive authority that he spent most of his Presidency claimed did not exist. Viewed objectively, it seems clear that the authority the President now claims not only likely exists under the law, but has always existed from the moment he walked into the Oval Office on January 20, 2009. So, viewed equally objectively, one can only assume that his decision to continually tell his supporters in the Latino community that he could not do what they wanted him to do was nothing more than part of a plan to play politics with an issue that they care deeply about. One wonders how they might feel about being played for fools for the past five years.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON (CNN) - President Barack Obama will unveil his long-awaited immigration plan Thursday evening, changing rules governing deportations that could affect millions of undocumented immigrants and setting off an explosive battle with Republicans.\n\nObama's prime-time address will be followed Friday by an event in Las Vegas, sources tell CNN. While exact details of his announcement aren't yet public, the basic outline of the plan, as relayed by people familiar with its planning, includes deferring deportation for the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would affect up to 3.5 million people.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for far too long,\" Obama said in a video posted on his Facebook page Wednesday. \"And so what I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as President to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress to encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nThe President declared in June he wouldn't wait for Congress to pass a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system, initially saying he would announce changes by the end the summer. The decision was delayed until after the midterm elections, when the White House believed it wouldn't be caught up in campaign politics.\n\nBut Republicans are expressing deep anger at the anticipated move, saying unilateral action on immigration would forestall any legislative action.\n\nTwo House Republicans who would play a key role in crafting immigration legislation made a fresh call for Obama to hold off on his plans Wednesday -- and warned that if he goes ahead, they'll try to stop the White House from implementing his executive order.\n\n\"Instead of proceeding with ill-advised executive action, we implore you to work with Congress to enact legislation to address our broken immigration system,\" Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said in a letter to Obama.\n\n\"We strongly urge you to respect the Constitution and abandon any unconstitutional, unilateral executive actions on immigration. Let's secure the border, enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States, and build a broad consensus for immigration reform,\" they wrote. \"Otherwise, as the chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation's immigration laws, we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\"\n\nWhat's in the plan\n\nThe contours of Obama's announcement have been the subject of speculation among immigration activists for months, though the White House has yet to officially relay what Obama will announce when he speaks to the American people on Thursday night.\n\nAdministration officials say a key part of the announcement will be allowing the parents of American citizens, who are undocumented immigrants themselves, to remain in the United States without the threat of deportation. That would include the parents of legal residents, but not the parents of children eligible for delayed deportation under a rule Obama enacted in 2012.\n\nUp to 3.6 million people would be affected by that change, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute, though the figures are smaller if Obama's announcement includes a minimum number of years spent in the country.\n\nMandating parents live in the U.S. for at least 5 years before becoming eligible would bring the number affected to 3.3 million; a 10-year minimum would bring it down further to an estimated 2.5 million people.\n\nOther potential areas of reform include extending the deportation deferment for immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. Altering the age restrictions on that action could allow hundreds of thousands more people to remain in the United States.\n\nOfficials also said the plan could include a stronger focus on deporting criminals who are undocumented immigrants and an expansion of worker visas in areas like technology.\n\nLastly, the plan could include new resources to bolster security on the border. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the \"reforms will be comprehensive,\" and that border security measures will be included.",

                    "body": "Washington -- President Obama is set to take sweeping executive action aimed at protecting some 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nThe move will satisfy a promise Mr. Obama made to immigrant and Latino groups long clamoring for relief on deportations. But it will also enflame already-high partisan tensions in Washington and color the rest of Mr. Obama's presidency - as well as the 2016 presidential race.\n\nObama will make his announcement Thursday in a televised address to the nation at 8 p.m. ET, the president announced in a video posted on WhiteHouse.gov. On Friday, he heads to Nevada - a political battleground state with a big Latino population - to give a speech promoting the move.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Obama said in the video. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long.\"\n\nHe said he will lay out measures that he can take with his \"lawful authority as president\" to improve the immigration system, while working with Congress to \"get a bipartisan and comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nObama has stated in the past that he would \"rip up\" any executive action as soon as Congress passed legislation he was willing to sign.\n\nBut the reality is far less hopeful. Republican leaders in Congress have made clear that any broad executive action on immigration would poison their relationship with Obama, and hinder their ability to work together. They call Obama's planned move \"executive amnesty.\"\n\nObama, for his part, may well have concluded that he wasn't going to get much done anyway with Congress during his final two years in office, and so he might as well act on his own. The Republicans pounded the Democrats in the Nov. 4 midterms, taking control of the Senate and expanding their House majority come January.\n\nObama's immigration move presents a big test for Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. Will their members go nuclear and shut down the government by refusing to fund the government in time for the Dec. 11 deadline? Or will they finesse the situation, finding a way to defund the president's moves on immigration without taking action that does further damage to the GOP brand?\n\nHouse Republicans reportedly crafted two plans Tuesday aimed at countering Obama on immigration without shutting down the government. One plan calls for passing a broad spending bill, then rescinding funds needed to implement Obama's immigration move. The other would take the funds out of the spending bill, and make it stand-alone legislation.\n\n\"We went down the government shutdown route a year ago. It didn't work, and I think a lot of people that recall that don't think it's wise to repeat that exercise,\" Rep. Tom Cole (R) of Oklahoma told The New York Times. \"We've got a lot more than just a sledgehammer in the toolbox, and so let's use some of these other weapons that we have.\"\n\nNotably, though, House Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio has not ruled out the possibility of another shutdown. The last shutdown was in October 2013; public blame fell on the Republicans.\n\nObama and the Democrats see his latest move on immigration as driven by a desire to do the right thing for millions of people in the country illegally and unable to get right with the law. Many have relatives in the United States who are either American citizens or have another form of legal status, including so-called \"Dreamers\" - people who were brought into the US illegally as children and are beneficiaries of Obama's 2012 move to defer deportation.\n\nThe executive action Obama will announce on Thursday aims to protect some 5 million undocumented immigrants. Criteria will include how long they have been in the US and family connections in the country.\n\nRepublicans see an effort by Obama to goad them into overreacting, and hurting their party's image further with Latino voters.\n\n\"Obama doesn't want to be seen as a lame-duck president,\" says Republican strategist Ford O'Connell. \"He wants to frame this as Republicans being obstructionist, when in fact it's Obama who is going against the will of the American people.\"\n\nIn recent years, Obama's posture toward people in the US illegally has shifted. He used to say he didn't have the power to waive deportations for broad categories beyond the \"Dreamers.\" But in the last year, as his frustration with congressional Republicans has grown and pressure from immigration groups has risen, his rhetoric has grown bolder.\n\nObama also has a vested interested in being succeeded by a Democrat in 2016, as a way to vindicate his record and protect his legacy. In the next election, the fast-growing Latino community will be as critical a voting bloc as ever.",

                    "body": "President Barack Obama will use a prime-time television speech tomorrow to present the biggest reprieve for undocumented immigrants in a generation, even as his order falls short of goals embraced by legislation the U.S. Senate passed last year.\n\nObama's unilateral action, circumventing a deadlocked Congress, promises to remove the immediate risk of deportation for 4 million to 5 million undocumented immigrants and initiate a showdown with congressional Republicans. The debate may set battle lines for the 2016 presidential campaign and shape the political loyalties of fast-growing ethnic groups for years to come.\n\nRepublican congressional leaders accused the president of exceeding his authority. They searched for a response to Obama that satisfies lawmakers, while avoiding a shutdown of the federal government that could hurt the party's image.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner of Ohio is fielding demands that include suing the president, censuring him, threatening to cut off all government funding or, perhaps the most likely response, choking off the portion of funds he would need to implement his orders.\n\nObama and Democrats would reap the political benefits of another government shutdown, said Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole, a Boehner ally.\n\n'Upset' Lawmakers\n\n\"We have every right to be mad. But when you're upset and mad doing what the person that provoked you wants you to do is usually not a very smart way to go,\" Cole told reporters. \"The smart thing is to find another way to deal with the president, because he's trying to pick a bar fight.\"\n\nThe broader political stakes were underscored by the Obama administration's plan to roll out the announcement: a rare prime-time address to the nation via cable TV news channels, Spanish-language Univision, and other outlets. That will be followed by a trip to Nevada, a presidential battleground state.\n\nNevada's electorate has increasingly trended Democratic as its Hispanic population grows and the ethnic group's political allegiances shift more heavily toward the president's party.\n\nObama is hosting a private dinner tonight at the White House with congressional Democrats to lay out the strategy.\n\nBetween 4 million and 5 million undocumented immigrants will be protected from deportation for the rest of Obama's presidency, according to a person familiar with the plan. That exceeds the nearly 2.7 million given permanent legal status by the 1986 immigration law signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan.\n\nSenate Bill\n\nThe bipartisan Senate legislation that stalled in the Republican-led House would have initially granted legal status to 8 million immigrants in the country illegally, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nObama's executive actions would give temporary visas to undocumented immigrants whose children were born in the U.S., according to people familiar with the proposal. The plan would expand eligibility for his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has given protection to 600,000 child immigrants.\n\nThe planned action, which the White House says is a partial fix for the U.S. immigration system, may improve Obama's standing with Hispanics after he presided over a record number of deportations and damage his chances of working with Republicans in Congress on other issues.\n\nThe idea behind his strategy is to cover categories of immigrants that would be politically difficult for Republicans to oppose, because that would involve separating parents from their children, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the matter.\n\n'Resist' Urge\n\nAnna Navarro, former chief Hispanic adviser to Arizona Senator John McCain, said Republicans \"need to resist the urge of taking their toys and going home from the playground because Obama stuck his tongue out at them.\" A fight over keeping parents with their children won't be a winning political argument for Republicans, she said.\n\nBy centering his plan on family unification, Obama is seeking to drive a wedge in the Republican Party, which includes lawmakers who support what the president is doing even if they oppose his use of presidential powers to achieve it.\n\nObama, in a White House video posted today, said his speech tomorrow at 8 p.m. Washington time will explain how he's tackling an issue that's been allowed \"to fester far too long.\" He'll then fly on Nov. 21 to Las Vegas to discuss his immigration actions at a school, the president said.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said Obama was abusing his power and should have worked more with Republicans.\n\n\"There is nobody who's abused the authority to issue executive orders more than the current occupant of the White House,\" he said. Obama is undermining Republican support for \"common-sense immigration bills,\" he said.\n\nPeople's Will\n\nEven some of the most outspoken critics of Obama's immigration stance expressed caution over risking a federal shutdown in order to reprimand him.\n\nCongress must approve funds by Dec. 11 to keep the government open or trigger an interruption similar to last year, when Republican demands to defund the president's health-care law led to a 16-day partial shutdown.\n\nIowa Representative Steve King, who once called for an electric fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, said today he wants legislation expressing disapproval of Obama's actions or to censure him before considering a fight over funding.\n\n\"I only want to do the minimum -- the minimum -- to put the president back in his constitutional boundaries,\" said King. \"I'm always looking for a better alternative,\" he said in response to a question about shutting down the government.\n\nRetroactive Action\n\nEarlier, Boehner and his allies said they're reviewing alternatives to using a funding bill to fight the executive action, including retroactively canceling money in 2015 for any action taken by Obama.\n\nDan Stein, president of Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a Washington-based group that opposes legalization for undocumented immigrants, said the planned unilateral actions show the president is \"way out of control.\"\n\n\"This is a man who doesn't care what the rule of law says,\" Stein said. \"At some point along the way, there will be public support for discussion of impeachment.\"\n\nPublic Opinion\n\nIn an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released today, 48 percent of Americans oppose Obama taking executive action on immigration while 38 percent support it. About 14 percent have no opinion or are unsure. The poll was conducted Nov. 14-17 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nObama will also expand a program that gives work permits for up to 29 months to foreign graduates of U.S. universities with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math, according to the people, who requested anonymity before a formal announcement. That provides more workers to fill high-tech jobs.\n\nThe administration already broadened eligibility for the program in 2012 by increasing the qualifying fields of study.\n\nThe executive action will include enforcement measures and changes to legal-immigration procedures, the people said.\n\nThe president is expected to stop short of including the parents of children brought to the U.S. illegally, called Dreamers, the people said. Senate Democrats were pressing the White House to cover this group under the current plan.\n\nLabeling Amnesty\n\nRepublicans aren't united on the immigration issue. Some say the party must take steps to ease its stance against undocumented immigrants while others consider them lawbreakers who don't deserve what many of them label amnesty.\n\nNational demographic shifts, particularly in competitive states such as Nevada and Florida, make the support of Hispanic voters important to both political parties.\n\nSome Republicans are vowing to try to block the executive action, arguing that it's an unconstitutional power grab that will poison the environment for bipartisan compromise in the new Congress, which they will control.\n\nA group of at least 60 House Republicans is pushing to use a government funding bill to deny the president the money needed to implement his plan.\n\nNot 'Appropriate'\n\nThe White House began sharing policy and messaging plans yesterday with outside groups and Democrats on Capitol Hill. In addition to arguing that Obama has the legal authority to revamp the immigration system, the White House says Congress can step in at any time with legislation.\n\n\"There is a very simple solution to the perception that somehow the president is exercising too much executive authority, and that's for Congress to pass a bipartisan bill to permanently fix the system,\" according to White House talking points, which were obtained by Bloomberg.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will outline a plan on Thursday to relax U.S. immigration policy for as many as 5 million people, bypassing Congress and angering Republicans.\n\nU.S. Representative Paul Ryan, the leading Republican voice on fiscal policy and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, called the plan a \"partisan bomb\" while a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner branded the president \"Emperor Obama\" for acting unilaterally.\n\nThe White House said Obama will deliver a televised speech at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday (0100 GMT Friday) laying out the plan followed by a trip to Las Vegas on Friday. Nevada is home to the highest proportion of undocumented immigrants.\n\nFrustrated by years of congressional inaction on what most in Washington agree is a broken immigration system, Obama said he is now prepared to use his executive authority.\n\nObama's directives are expected to remove the threat of deportation for as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States.\n\nThe decision will cement his legacy as having aided Hispanics who helped elect him in 2008 and who have become increasingly vocal in their frustration that he has failed to live up to his promise to enact immigration reform.\n\nThe unilateral overhaul will likely have a ripple effect on the campaign to find a successor to the president in 2016. While Hispanics will no doubt be pleased, Democrats could face a backlash from voters.\n\nReaction was swift from Republicans who took control of the Senate in Nov. 4 elections and strengthened their grip on the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile liberal Democrats were thrilled at Obama's decision to move ahead, some moderate voices in Obama's party were uneasy.\n\n\"I wish he wouldn't do it,\" said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \"I just wish he wouldn't do it.\"\n\nObama will host 18 congressional Democrats at the White House to consolidate support for his immigration plans among his closest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have threatened to fight the immigration move by imposing funding restrictions in a must-pass spending bill, which could conceivably lead to a government shutdown.\n\nRepublican leaders, however, have stressed they will not allow a shutdown after facing heavy criticism for the last one a year ago.\n\nHouse Republicans are weighing a range of responses to register their disapproval.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue and many others,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nFor a president known for having deported thousands of illegal migrants, the actions he will take mark a dramatic shift in course, although advocacy groups will argue that he should go even further in protecting more people who work low-paying jobs that many American citizens prefer not to do.\n\nSources close to the administration said Obama is planning to issue a reprieve from deportation that will cover some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.\n\nThat initiative would expand on a 2012 executive order by the president that gave relief from deportation and work permits to undocumented children brought to the United States by their parents.\n\nThere is also expected to be a border security element and Obama will act to help companies hire and retain high-skilled workers from abroad, the sources said.\n\nObama's move is his most defiant step yet in reaction to the elections handing control of the Senate to Republicans. The new political order in Washington will test Obama's ability to make compromises with his opponents.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 48 percent would prefer Obama not act on his own, while 38 percent support it and 14 percent had no opinion or were unsure.\n\nThe last major immigration overhaul that expanded the number of legal migrants was in 1986 through legislation signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. An attempt by President George W. Bush in 2007 for immigration reform failed.\n\nIt is not out of the question that Obama early next year could offer to approve the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline from Canada in exchange for a deal on immigration legislation.\n\nDespite claims that Obama may overstep his executive powers, Stephen Legomsky, a former U.S. immigration official who is now a professor at Washington University law school, said the president's planned action appeared to fit well within the bounds of established law and prosecutorial discretion.\n\n(Additional reporting by Julia Edwards, Susan Cornwell, Doina Chiacu, Amanda Becker, Susan Heavey and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Tom Brown)",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- In a broad test of his executive powers, President Barack Obama declared Wednesday he will sidestep Congress and order his own federal action on immigration -- in measures that could spare from deportation as many as 5 million people illegally in the U.S. and set up one of the most pitched partisan confrontations of his presidency.\n\nObama declared that Washington has allowed America's immigration problem \"to fester for too long.\"\n\nThe president will use an 8 p.m. EST address Thursday to announce his measures and will sign the executive actions during a rally in Las Vegas on Friday. In doing so, Obama will be taking an aggressive stand that he had once insisted was beyond his presidential power.\n\nAs many as 5 million people in the country illegally are likely to be protected from deportation and made eligible for work permits under the plan. They would not have a path to citizenship, however, and the actions could be reversed by a new president in two years. Officials said the eligible immigrants would not be entitled to federal benefits -- including health care tax credits -- under Obama's plan.\n\nThe 5 million estimate includes extending deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years. The president also is likely to expand his 2-year-old program that protects young immigrants from deportation. The administration had considered extending the executive action to parents of young immigrants covered under the 2012 Obama directive, but immigration advocates said they did not expect the parents to be included in the final plan.\n\n\"What I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem,\" Obama said in a video on Facebook.\n\nLaying the groundwork for his actions, Obama invited 18 Democratic members of the House and Senate -- but no Republicans -- to dinner at the White House Wednesday. Among the networks airing his Thursday speech will be Univision, which will interrupt the Latin Grammys to carry his remarks, assuring him a huge Spanish-speaking audience.\n\nObama is to speak at Las Vegas' Del Sol High School on Friday, a school with a large population of non-English speaking students where Obama unveiled his blueprint for comprehensive immigration legislation in 2013.\n\nRepublicans vehemently oppose the president's likely actions but are deeply divided and have spent much of the week intensely debating how to respond. Some conservative members have threatened to pursue a government shutdown and one -- two-term Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama -- raised the specter of impeachment on Wednesday.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner's spokesman criticized Obama's planned announcement, noting that the president himself had said in the past that he was not \"emperor\" and was limited in his ability to act.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" the spokesman, Michael Steel, said.\n\nA wide-ranging immigration bill passed the Senate last year, but stalled in the Republican-led House. Senate Democratic leaders on Wednesday took turns declaring their support for Obama's unilateral action, blaming Republican inaction for forcing Obama to act.\n\n\"There's one more chance: Just put the bill on the floor, Speaker Boehner,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a lead author of the bill that passed the Senate. \"Pass the bill and we will not even have to debate executive action.\"\n\nEven Republicans who supported the Senate bill that would have overhauled immigration laws said Obama's go-it-alone approach would backfire. Still, they cautioned their party colleagues not to overreach in their response.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who worked on the Senate legislation, said the executive actions would leave the status of millions of immigrants unresolved and would not address what he called a broken immigration system.\n\n\"Our response has to be measured -- can't capitulate, can't overreact,\" he said. \"Impeachment or shutting down the entire government would be an unwise move.\"\n\nAdjustments also are expected to a 2012 program that allowed immigrants under 31 who had arrived before June 2007 to apply for a reprieve from deportation and a work permit. More than 600,000 young immigrants have been shielded from deportation to date under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Removing the upper age limit so that applicants don't have to be under 31 -- one option under consideration -- would make an additional 200,000 people eligible.\n\nThe beneficiaries of Obama's new executive action would be treated in the same manner as those immigrants who were shielded from deportation in his 2012 directive, according to one official who discussed the limits of Obama's action on the condition of anonymity, lacking authority to speak on the record at this point.\n\nThose young immigrants covered by the 2012 action can obtain work permits but are not eligible for food stamps, federal welfare benefits or disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program. They also are ineligible for tax credits under Obama's health care law, though they can buy health coverage at full price on the exchanges created by the law. They may be eligible for public benefits provided by some states.\n\nSome immigrant advocates worried that even though Obama's actions would make millions eligible for work permits, not all would participate out of fear that Republicans or a new president would reverse Obama's actions.",

Nevada is home to the highest proportion of undocumented immigrants.\n\nFrustrated by years of congressional inaction on what most in Washington agree is a broken immigration system, Obama said he is now prepared to use his executive authority.\n\nObama's directives are expected to remove the threat of deportation for as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States.\n\nThe decision will cement his legacy as having aided Hispanics who helped elect him in 2008 and who have become increasingly vocal in their frustration that he has failed to live up to his promise to enact immigration reform.\n\nThe unilateral overhaul will likely have a ripple effect on the campaign to find a successor to the president in 2016. While Hispanics will no doubt be pleased, Democrats could face a backlash from voters.\n\nReaction was swift from Republicans who took control of the Senate in Nov. 4 elections and strengthened their grip on the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile liberal Democrats were thrilled at Obama's decision to move ahead, some moderate voices in Obama's party were uneasy.\n\n\"I wish he wouldn't do it,\" said Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \"I just wish he wouldn't do it.\"\n\nObama will host 18 congressional Democrats at the White House to consolidate support for his immigration plans among his closest allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nSome conservative Republicans have threatened to fight the immigration move by imposing funding restrictions in a must-pass spending bill, which could conceivably lead to a government shutdown.\n\nRepublican leaders, however, have stressed they will not allow a shutdown after facing heavy criticism for the last one a year ago.\n\nHouse Republicans are weighing a range of responses to register their disapproval.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue and many others,\" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nFor a president known for having deported thousands of illegal migrants, the actions he will take mark a dramatic shift in course, although advocacy groups will argue that he should go even further in protecting more people who work low-paying jobs that many American citizens prefer not to do.\n\nSources close to the administration said Obama is planning to issue a reprieve from deportation that will cover some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.\n\nThat initiative would expand on a 2012 executive order by the president that gave relief from deportation and work permits to undocumented children brought to the United States by their parents.\n\nThere is also expected to be a border security element and Obama will act to help companies hire and retain high-skilled workers from abroad, the sources said.\n\nObama's move is his most defiant step yet in reaction to the elections handing control of the Senate to Republicans. The new political order in Washington will test Obama's ability to make compromises with his opponents.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found 48 percent would prefer Obama not act on his own, while 38 percent support it and 14 percent had no opinion or were unsure.\n\nThe last major immigration overhaul that expanded the number of legal migrants was in 1986 through legislation signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. An attempt by President George W. Bush in 2007 for immigration reform failed.\n\nIt is not out of the question that Obama early next year could offer to approve the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline from Canada in exchange for a deal on immigration legislation.\n\nDespite claims that Obama may overstep his executive powers, Stephen Legomsky, a former U.S. immigration official who is now a professor at Washington University law school, said the president's planned action appeared to fit well within the bounds of established law and prosecutorial discretion.",

Officials said the eligible immigrants would not be entitled to federal benefits -- including health care tax credits -- under Obama's plan.\n\nThe 5 million estimate assumes the President will extend deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years. The President also is likely to extend his past order protecting young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as minors from deportation.\n\nImmigration advocates said they did not expect those immigrants' parents to be included in the final plan.\n\nTo line up support, Obama invited 18 Democratic members of Congress -- but no Republicans -- to dinner at the White House Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans are divided over how to respond. Some conservatives have threatened to pursue a government shutdown, and two-term Republican Rep.

Democrats have worked in recent days, writing op-eds and appearing on television, to defend such an announcement from Republican criticism.\n\nPres. Obama was first reported on Wednesday to be giving an immigration announcement on Friday, but later the White House said the address would be given on Thursday evening.\n\n\"This is a step forward in the President's plan to work with Congress on passing common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\nLast Wednesday, following the Republican Party's takeover of the US Senate, Obama warned that he would take whatever lawful actions he feels are necessary to \"improve the function of our immigration system,\" following years of unsuccessful efforts from Congress to accomplish as much on its own. The White House says that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has previously pushed back on efforts from Democratic lawmakers to introduce immigration reform, and the results of last Tuesday's mid-term elections will soon see to it that the GOP has a majority in the Senate as well next session.\n\n\"So if in fact there is a great eagerness on the part of Republicans to tackle a broken immigration system, then they have every opportunity to do it,\" the president said. \"My executive actions don't prevent them...but should be a spur for them to try and get something done,\" said Obama.\n\nOn the heels of Obama's post-Election Day remarks, Republican Party representatives said the GOP should consider countering any attempt from the White House to unilaterally weigh in on immigration reform with an order of impeachment. GOP leaders added that any executive action would \"poison the well\" for the rest of Obama's two-plus years in office.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky), the soon-to-be Senate majority leader, said the use of executive authority in this instance \"would be like waving a red flag in front of a bull.\"\n\nBy taking executive action, it is likely that Obama will derail any opportunities to cooperate with the GOP majority in Congress during the rest of his term, including on bipartisan initiatives like tax reform, among other issues.",

                    "body": "Republicans are crying overreach, but how will the public react to a plan to shield millions from deportation? Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n\nEnding what seemed like an eternity of suspense, President Obama will announce the executive action he's taking on immigration in a prime-time White House address on Thursday night.\n\nRepublicans have already delivered their response to a plan expected to circumvent Congress and shield up to five million undocumented immigrants from deportation: A spokesman for Speaker John Boehner called the president \"Emperor Obama,\" and party leaders are planning to attack the executive order through legal challenges and legislative maneuvers.\n\nBut how will the public react? Obama is planning an aggressive rollout that, in addition to the rare evening speech, will include a campaign-style rally in Las Vegas at the same high school where he announced his principles for immigration reform nearly two years ago. He'll chastise Congress for its inaction, and he'll cite the precedents of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, who each gave undocumented immigrants a reprieve with less of a backlash from the opposition party. The image will be that of a \"liberated\" Obama, unbowed by his party's electoral losses and his lame-duck status, intent on making the most of his final years in office.\n\n\"Everyone agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Obama said Wednesday in a Facebook post announcing his upcoming announcement. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long. So what I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nPost by The White House.\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday suggested public support for the substance of the president's plan, but not the process. A clear majority of respondents, 57 percent, backed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and that number rose to 72 percent when they told that immigrants would have to pay a fine and undergo a background check. Yet nearly half of respondents, 48 percent, opposed Obama's intention to act unilaterally on the issue, compared to 38 percent who supported it.\n\nDemocratic advocates for immigration reform are eagerly awaiting the details of Obama's order, which reportedly will make work permits available to millions but would not make them eligible for health benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The program is modeled on the \"deferred action\" plan for children of undocumented immigrants -- the so-called Dreamers -- that Obama announced in 2012, but it reportedly might not cover their parents.\n\nIn the short term, Republicans have said executive action would \"poison the well\" with their new majority and ruin the chances for legislation while Obama is president. (The president has replied that his orders would go away if Congress actually passes a bill.) But the prospects under the new Senate leadership on Capitol Hill were dim to begin with, making the fight for public opinion on such a polarizing issue even more important in the context of the 2016 presidential election. That's another reason why Obama is traveling to Nevada, a battleground state that is home to a large Hispanic population and is likely to feature both a marquee Senate and presidential race in two years. The sales job will begin there, and Obama has to hope he'll have more success persuading the public on immigration than he did with Congress.",

The plan would expand eligibility for his 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has given protection to 600,000 child immigrants.\n\nObama's speech is scheduled for 8 p.m. tomorrow Washington time,\n\nThe planned action, which the White House says is a partial fix for the U.S. immigration system, may improve Obama's standing with Hispanics after he presided over a record number of deportations and damage his chances of working with Republicans in Congress on other policy matters.\n\nThe idea behind his strategy is to cover categories of immigrants that would be politically difficult for Republicans to oppose, because that would involve separating parents from their children, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the matter.\n\nFamily Unification\n\nBy centering his plan on family unification, Obama is seeking to drive a wedge in the Republican Party, which includes members who support what the president is doing even if they oppose his use of presidential powers to achieve it.\n\nSenator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said Obama was abusing his power and instead should have worked with Republicans.\n\n\"There is nobody who's abused the authority to issue executive orders more than the current occupant of the White House,\" he said. Obama is undermining Republican support for \"common-sense immigration bills,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said Obama was behaving as an \"emperor\" and ignoring the will of the people. \"He will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said in an e-mail.\n\nIn an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released today, 48 percent of Americans oppose Obama taking executive action on immigration while 38 percent support it. About 14 percent have no opinion or are unsure. The poll was conducted Nov. 14-17 and has a margin ofObama will also expand a program that gives work permits for up to 29 months to foreign graduates of U.S. universities with degrees in science, technology, engineering and math, according to the people, who requested anonymity before a formal announcement. That provides more workers to fill high-tech jobs.\n\nThe administration already broadened eligibility for the program in 2012 by increasing the qualifying fields of study.\n\nThe executive action will include enforcement measures and changes to legal-immigration procedures, the people said.\n\nThe president's action is expected to stop short of including the parents of children brought to the U.S. illegally, called Dreamers, the people said. Senate Democrats were pressing the White House to cover this group under the current plan.\n\nRepublicans are vowing to try to block the executive action, arguing that it's an unconstitutional power grab that will poison the environment for bipartisan compromise in the new Congress, which they will control.\n\nA group of at least 60 House Republicans is pushing to use a government funding bill to deny the president the money needed to implement his plan. Congress must approve funds by Dec. 11 to keep the government open or risk an interruption similar to last year, when Republican demands to defund the president's health- care law led to a 16-day partial shutdown.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have been urging the president to be bold with his plan. They cite the failure of the Republican-led House to take up a bill the Senate passed last year with bipartisan support creating a path to citizenship for many of the nation's estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants.\n\nRepublicans are split on the immigration issue generally. Some say the party must take steps to ease its stance against undocumented immigrants while others consider them lawbreakers who don't deserve what many of them label amnesty.\n\nNational demographic shifts, particularly in competitive states such as Nevada and Florida, make the support of Hispanic voters critical to both political parties.\n\nRepublicans have already begun to temper some of their threats over shutting down the government to stop Obama.\n\nEarlier yesterday, Boehner and his allies said they're reviewing alternatives to using a funding bill to fight the executive action, including retroactively canceling money in 2015 for any action taken by Obama.\n\nRepublican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Boehner ally, said many members \"understand what was done in October of last year is not the appropriate way going forward.\" Court challenges also are a possibility, he said.\n\n\"The conference is trying to be a lot more thoughtful,\" Cole said. \"Our aim is to shut down what the president is doing, not to shut down the government.\"\n\nThe White House began sharing both policy and messaging plans yesterday with outside groups and Democrats on Capitol Hill. In addition to arguing that Obama has the legal authority to revamp the immigration system, the White House says Congress can step in at any time with legislation.\n\n\"There is a very simple solution to the perception that somehow the president is exercising too much executive authority, and that's for Congress to pass a bipartisan bill to permanently fix the system,\" according to White House talking points, which were obtained by Bloomberg.\n\n\"If they get that done, the president looks forward to signing it into law -- superseding the actions he's taken on his own to fix as much of the system as he can.\"\n\nThe number of people who would be protected from prosecution depends on how the executive action is structured and whether it requires the undocumented parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have been in the country for five years or 10 years to qualify.\n\nThe Migration Policy Institute has estimated that a five- year threshold would protect 3.3 million parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents. It also would provide a reprieve for 1.2 million spouses, a set that overlaps with the group of parents. The figures would be much lower -- 2.5 million parents and 910,000 spouses -- if the bar was set at 10 years, according to the institute.\n\nIn addition, the institute reported, 520,000 undocumented immigrants would be shielded by an Obama order that changes eligibility for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by eliminating the maximum age of 30 and changing the age of arrival to under 18.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will announce his intention Thursday to use his executive powers to shield millions of immigrants from deportation, the most significant presidential intervention to alter the U.S. immigration system in nearly three decades.\n\nUsing a rare prime-time address from the White House, Obama hopes to build public support for his decision to remake border control laws without approval from Congress. The move is likely to spark a major political fight about the limits of presidential power.\n\nObama will provide more details at a rally with immigration advocates in Las Vegas on Friday as the White House begins to mobilize grassroots support for the effort.\n\nObama is expected to announce measures that would make as many as 4 million immigrants eligible for temporary protected status and provide relief to an additional 1 million through other means, according to people briefed on the plans.\n\nHe also will take steps to expand visas for high-tech workers, modify federal immigrant detention procedures, and add resources to strengthen security at the border, they said.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Obama said in a brief video on his Facebook page Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long.\"\n\nBut even as he moved to address an old problem, Obama created a new political tempest on Capitol Hill, where Republicans quickly denounced his actions less than two weeks after voters handed the GOP full control of Congress.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, referred to the president as \"Emperor Obama\" and charged that he was exceeding his constitutional authority and cementing \"his legacy of lawlessness.\"\n\nSeveral GOP members suggested using a government spending bill next month to counter Obama's move by defunding related immigration programs, setting up the potential for a government shutdown.\n\n\"This is presidential overreach of monumental proportions,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \"It's a direct erosion of congressional power. ... I think Congress needs to and will resist and do so in a way that is responsible.\"\n\nThe showdown comes two years after Obama, fresh off his 2012 re-election, announced he would pursue a legislative overhaul of immigration laws as he sought to fulfill a campaign promise to Latino and Asian-American supporters who were frustrated that he had not done more on immigration in his first term.\n\nAn 18-month effort to pass legislation, which included a path to citizenship, collapsed this summer in the face of strenuous opposition in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nIn June, Obama promised to act aggressively on the problem in areas where the law allowed the use of his executive authority.\n\nAdministration lawyers have spent months reviewing case law and meeting with immigration advocates, law enforcement officials and legal experts to develop options for Obama, who reviewed them with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nUnder his plan, Obama will provide administrative relief to parents who are in the country illegally and whose children are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, an adult population that reaches an estimated 3.46 million, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nHowever, the president's order also will require the parents to have lived in the United States for a certain number of years -- likely 10. The average immigrant here illegally has lived in the country for 13 years.\n\nMany of those who receive administrative relief also would be eligible to apply for work permits.\n\nObama also is expected to expand a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of nearly 600,000 younger immigrants known as \"dreamers\" who were brought into the country illegally as children.\n\nHis plans would expand that program by raising the maximum current age from 30 and raising the maximum arrival age above 16.\n\nHowever, it is not known how many years of eligibility he will add at either end or how many more people would be covered.\n\nObama will stop short of extending protections to hundreds of thousands of parents of the dreamers, after the White House Office of Legal Counsel determined that doing so would exceed the president's legal authorities to act unilaterally, according to the people briefed on the plans.\n\nAbout 671,000 parents live with children who are in the country illegally, and 6.5 million live with no children at all -- meaning that most of them are unlikely to be eligible for deportation relief, although some might qualify under other potential changes, including if they serve in the U.S. military.\n\n\"Even if they help 5 million people, a lot of others will be left out, but it is still a huge step forward and an historic decision. It is one of the biggest victories we've ever had,\" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a national immigrant advocacy group based in Washington.\n\nWhite House officials declined to provide details about the president's announcement, but Johnson called the plan \"comprehensive.\" He and other administration officials emphasized that Obama remains supportive of Congress' undertaking a broader legislative fix to immigration laws.\n\nWhile some Republicans appear eager for a fight with the White House, others cautioned that the party should tread carefully.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence that congressional Republicans will extend the government's funding, which is to expire next month.",

Republicans were not invited to attend.\n\nObama will address the nation about immigration at 8 p.m. EST on Thursday, and then speak about the issue again on Friday in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Everybody agrees our immigration system is broken,\" Obama said in a video announcing the Thursday speech. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long. What I am going to be laying out are the things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress.\"\n\nObama will have to make the case that his actions are the right move, and will likely need Democrats and immigration advocates to stand with him. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Wednesday found that 48 percent of Americans oppose Obama taking executive action, while 38 percent support it and 14 percent were unsure or had no opinion.\n\nEarnest said the White House is expecting \"a rather lengthy discussion\" about executive action on immigration, and that the president \"is looking forward to this debate.\"\n\n\"The president feels very confident both in the steps that he has taken, he also feels very confident in knowing that these steps are going to be good for the country,\" he said.\n\n\"This is an important step that will have a pretty profound impact on the lives of millions of people who live here,\" he added later.\n\nPolitico reported earlier Wednesday that the relief will apply to about 5 million undocumented immigrants, including people with long-standing ties to the country such as parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. The reprieve will not include farm workers or the parents of so-called Dreamers, undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, according to Politico. Advocacy sources contacted by The Huffington Post said those details were consistent with that they'd heard.\n\nRepublicans have said broader deportation relief would be a radical overstep of Obama's authority. Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas), who chair the committees responsible for immigration and homeland security, sent a letter to the president on Wednesday saying that they \"will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said the GOP will not shut down the government over immigration, but House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has made no such promise. He said Republicans are still considering how to respond to Obama's executive action. One option could be setting up multiple showdowns over immigration by passing only short-term funding bills. Some Republicans have also suggested delaying the confirmation process for Obama's nominees or stonewalling him in other ways.\n\nEarnest declined to say what the president would do if he receives a government funding bill that would block executive action -- the move that could trigger a government shutdown. He said Congress is still able to pass its own immigration reform bills, and Obama would be happy to work with them.\n\nEarnest said there is \"a solid legal foundation\" for Obama's actions on immigration -- something many legal experts agree with. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson made the case earlier Wednesday, as he has before, that deferred action would be part of prosecutorial discretion, which is the need by law enforcement agencies to prioritize based on limited resources. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy for Dreamers is based on the same grounds.\n\nEarnest would not go into detail about the president's plans, but said they were all based on existing legal authority.\n\n\"Once we have an opportunity to talk about some of the details related to the executive action that the president has chosen to take, it will become clear that there is a solid legal authority for the president taking those actions,\" Earnest said.",

                    "body": "Ending what seemed like an eternity of suspense, President Obama will announce the executive action he's taking on immigration in a prime-time White House address on Thursday night.\n\nRepublicans have already delivered their response to a plan expected to circumvent Congress and shield up to five million undocumented immigrants from deportation: A spokesman for Speaker John Boehner called the president \"Emperor Obama,\" and party leaders are planning to attack the executive order through legal challenges and legislative maneuvers.\n\nBut how will the public react? Obama is planning an aggressive rollout that, in addition to the rare evening speech, will include a campaign-style rally in Las Vegas at the same high school where he announced his principles for immigration reform nearly two years ago. He'll chastise Congress for its inaction, and he'll cite the precedents of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, who each gave undocumented immigrants a reprieve with less of a backlash from the opposition party. The image will be that of a \"liberated\" Obama, unbowed by his party's electoral losses and his lame-duck status, intent on making the most of his final years in office.\n\n\"Everyone agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Obama said Wednesday in a Facebook post announcing his upcoming announcement. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long. So what I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Wednesday suggested public support for the substance of the president's plan, but not the process. A clear majority of respondents, 57 percent, backed a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and that number rose to 72 percent when they told that immigrants would have to pay a fine and undergo a background check. Yet nearly half of respondents, 48 percent, opposed Obama's intention to act unilaterally on the issue, compared to 38 percent who supported it.\n\nDemocratic advocates for immigration reform are eagerly awaiting the details of Obama's order,which reportedly will make work permits available to millions but would not make them eligible for health benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The program is modeled on the \"deferred action\" plan for children of undocumented immigrants -- the so-called Dreamers -- that Obama announced in 2012, but it reportedly might not cover their parents.\n\nIn the short term, Republicans have said executive action would \"poison the well\" with their new majority and ruin the chances for legislation while Obama is president. (The president has replied that his orders would go away if Congress actually passes a bill.) But the prospects under the new Senate leadership on Capitol Hill were dim to begin with, making the fight for public opinion on such a polarizing issue even more important in the context of the 2016 presidential election. That's another reason why Obama is traveling to Nevada, a battleground state that is home to a large Hispanic population and is likely to feature both a marquee Senate and presidential race in two years. The sales job will begin there, and Obama has to hope he'll have more success persuading the public on immigration than he did with Congress.",

The executive order he plans to sign this week will reportedly give as many as 5 million undocumented illegal aliens the right to stay and work in the U.S.\n\nBy introducing such changes now, the move will sidestep a newly-elected Republican-led U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, angering many on Capitol Hill and even raising eyebrows among some of the president's supporters. Only last year, the president reiterated his stance that unilateral immigration reform was not on his agenda.\n\n\"I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system,\" said Obama on Feb. 14, 2013.\n\nHowever, speaking from the White House in a video posted to Facebook, Obama stated his intention to circumvent debated legislation on immigration reform. He stated that he will address the nation in prime-time Thursday night and will introduce executive actions while in Las Vegas. He plans to sign and promote his new rules Friday.\n\nEmbedded post will show on publish\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken.

Otherwise, as the chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation's immigration laws, we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\"\n\nOthers were less diplomatic in their response:\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue - and many others,\" said House Speaker John Boehner in a statement.\n\nThe president will address the nation in a televised announcement Thursday night.\n\nComments\n\ncomments",

So what I'm going to be laying out is the things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nObama's action, while cheered by immigration reform advocates, could impact Democrats' ability to work with a new Republican-led Congress and has left Republicans in disagreement over how to proceed.\n\nThe president has faced persistent criticism from Republicans, and his decision now to act unilaterally -- without congressional backing -- becomes in issue in its own right.\n\nRepublicans keyed in on a particular remark last year, when Obama said he lacked power to take unilateral action because he is not \"emperor\" of the United States.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue - and many others,\" Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in a statement.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that Obama had the legal authority to act and insisted every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower used executive discretion.\n\nEarnest did not specify how the president could go against his own statement, and Obama urged Americans to tune in to his Thursday speech to learn details.\n\nUnivision, CNN, and a number of other cable channels plan to air the 8 p.m. speech Thursday. Many of the main commercial networks -- in the middle of November ratings sweeps -- will not. On Friday, Obama will promote his plan at a Las Vegas high school in the same increasingly Hispanic state where two years ago he outlined comprehensive reform principles.\n\nDetails emerged Wednesday night that indicated the president would not provide deportation relief to farm workers or the parents of Dreamers, immigrants who arrived in the United States as children but gained some protection from deportation through Obama's actions in 2012. Those who receive new protections will not be eligible for the government's health care subsidies, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe president's orders won't go nearly as far as permanent legislation. It will not resolve the question of citizenship for some of the 11 million undocumented residents, raise the cap for high-skilled immigrant visas, or make sweeping determinations about border security.\n\n\"Most of the core problems. . . still exist,\" said Emily Lam, the vice president for health care and federal issues for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. \"The question is, 'Does that set them off on the wrong foot for the new session and how much does it poison the well?'\"\n\nObama has warned Republicans that failure to pass an immigration bill would force him to use executive power. He delayed any action until after the elections at the behest of Democrats who feared it could backfire on certain candidates.\n\nBut his party still lost control of the Senate -- partly due to Obama's low approval ratings -- and Republicans blasted the president for acting even before the next Congress starts.\n\nSenator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who has played a key role in the Senate's immigration efforts, said the president's timing \"is going to poison the well very badly.\"\n\nTexas Senator John Cornyn, the Senate's second-ranking Republican, said in a Tuesday floor speech that the president's move was a \"squandering of the opportunity to work together on a bipartisan basis.\"\n\nThe Senate last year approved the most sweeping immigration overhaul in decades, with 14 Republicans voting alongside Democrats. It passed the chamber 68-32.\n\nBut John Boehner has refused to take up the Senate bill and Republicans could not come up with legislation of their own. This didn't hurt them in the midterm elections but it might play out differently in the 2016 presidential elections, when more Hispanics vote.\n\nMany Democrats have backed Obama.\n\n\"It's a needed step,\" said Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. The House has \"had an opportunity to lead. . . they have done nothing.\"\n\nThese dividing lines threaten to undermine the bipartisanship both parties promised after the midterm elections.\n\n\"What the president is trying to do is polarize this issue and define Republicans through inaction and hostility,\" said John Feehery, former spokesman for Dennis Hastert, a former Republican House speaker. \"Republicans have to not overreact to this, treat it professionally, and use it as an opportunity to define the next two years.\"\n\nBut Republicans have yet to develop a cohesive strategy, with members threatening everything from a shutdown of the government to impeachment of the president.\n\nIowa Representative Steve King and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, both Republicans who fought an immigration overhaul, have insisted the party use any means necessary to fight Obama's move.\n\n\"The people voted, and they voted against the president's illegal amnesty,\" said Cruz, who has instructed Congress not to confirm executive or judicial nominees as long as the action exists.\n\nKing is preparing legislation that would reverse the president's order.\n\nMore than 50 Republicans have signed onto a letter circulated by Arizona Representative Matt Salmon that requests language in an upcoming government spending bill that would prohibit funding for the president's intentions on immigration.\n\nKentucky Representative Harold Rogers, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, this week suggested passing the spending bill and then pulling funds for the president's actions.\n\nLawmakers must pass the bill in some form by Dec. 11 or face a government shutdown -- an action that worries a number of Republicans.\n\n\"What is not a solution is a shutdown of the government,\" said Florida Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a major force in the House's effort to craft an immigration bill.\n\nBoehner has vowed to fight the president \"tooth and nail,\" while incoming McConnell has pledged to avoid a shutdown.\n\nSome analysts and lawmakers believe Republicans can salvage the situation through tailored immigration bills.\n\n\"This would be the most productive Republican response rather than filing lawsuits or defunding the government,\" said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington think tank. \"It's a way to get control of the situation without alienating Hispanic voters and nullifying the president's executive action all in one stroke.\"",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will unveil his long-delayed executive order on immigration Thursday night, triggering a legal and political showdown with adversaries.\n\nEven with few details on the table, the impending order stirred a furor. Texas Republicans accused Obama of abusing his power and thumbing his nose at voters who decisively rejected Democrats in this month's elections.\n\n\"The president is making a very bad mistake here,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, the deputy Republican leader. \"There will be an appropriate and calibrated response to the president's illegal executive order.\"\n\nOther Republicans accused Obama of claiming imperial powers. The White House insisted that any steps the president takes will be well within his constitutional authority, though Cornyn and others warned of a fierce court fight to undo measures they cast as \"amnesty\" for lawbreakers.\n\nObama has been under intense pressure from Hispanic allies and immigrant advocates to shield millions of immigrants from the threat of deportation.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long,\" the president said in a video the White House posted to announce the Thursday prime-time address.\n\nObama will lay out the case for action in the face of congressional paralysis on immigration. And he will prod Republicans to send him legislation that would supersede any executive actions he takes.\n\nOn Friday, Obama will fly to Las Vegas to rally support for his order, and sign any related paperwork, at the same high school where he made the case for immigration reform two years ago.\n\nGOP lawmakers have warned for weeks that any unilateral moves will doom a legislative overhaul and, worse, poison relations between Obama and the GOP-controlled Congress across a range of issues.\n\nObama reportedly plans to protect up to 5 million immigrants in the country illegally who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years and have no criminal record.\n\nTexas has about 1,464,000 unauthorized foreign residents. According to an analysis of census records released Wednesday by the Migration Policy Institute, about 80 percent of those -- or nearly 1.2 million -- have lived in the U.S. more than five years.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz asserted that Obama's moves show that he \"is angry and defiant toward the voters.\" He likened an executive amnesty to \"declaring war on the voters. ... The president is not a monarch.\"\n\nRep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, a leading hard-liner on immigration, also blasted \"amnesty by executive order\" as something the public and Congress oppose. \"The actions President Obama is planning would be unprecedented and contrary to his oath of office to enforce the nation's laws,\" he said.\n\nCornyn denounced the \"power grab\" but cautioned fellow Republicans against overreacting.\n\n\"It's important that we not take the bait,\" he said. \"What the president is trying to do is to provoke a response here which will cause even more gridlock and division.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers are likely to try to use congressional spending authority as leverage to stymie the president. Some conservatives have floated the idea of impeachment or forcing a government shutdown, though GOP leaders have rejected such steps.\n\nHouse Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Austin, sought in vain to deter Obama from bypassing Congress.\n\nIf he pursues \"unconstitutional, unilateral executive actions on immigration,\" he wrote the president, with Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, \"we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\"\n\nA spokesman for Speaker John Boehner mocked the president as \"Emperor Obama.\"\n\nBut Obama allies argued that Republicans forced him to act by quashing the bipartisan immigration bill the Senate approved last year.\n\nLatino leaders and pro-immigrant activists have been impatient for presidential action. Obama promised to act by the end of the summer but waited until after the midterm elections. Republicans say that made the elections a referendum on amnesty, and that Obama should heed the judgment voters delivered by shifting control of the Senate to them.\n\nObama invited 18 key Democrats to dinner Wednesday night for a preview of his plans, a sign he has grown more comfortable with the idea of outright partisan warfare.\n\nHe also met with some pro-immigrant advocates. Arturo Rodriguez, president of United Farm Workers, reported afterward that Obama's plan would protect at least 250,000 farmworkers from deportation.\n\n\"The president is doing the right thing,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio. \"The American people have been waiting on Congress for years to fix our immigration system.\"\n\nCITIZENSHIP: No path to citizenship; the actions could be reversed by a new president.\n\nTHE STANDARD: Live in the country for five years; no criminal record.\n\nPARENTS: No deportation protection if children aren't citizens or legal permanent residents.",

The Obama administration has been looking at options including those parents who have been living in the United States for five years or 10 years.\n\nOne report also suggests the executive order would broaden assistance to undocumented residents who were brought to America as children.\n\nRepublicans are vehemently opposed to the president's likely actions, with some conservative members threatening to pursue a government shutdown if Obama follows through on his promises to act on immigration before the end of the year.\n\nThe trip comes as White House chief of staff Denis McDonough is scheduled to meet with Senate Democrats on Thursday. McDonough is likely to be pressed on the immigration issue in the closed-door luncheon.\n\nDemocrats want quick action\n\nDemocrats, including U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have been urging Obama to move quickly on immigration.\n\nSome have pointed to his failure to take executive action on the issue as costing Democrats votes in this month's congressional elections and setting up a Republicans sweep of congressional election earlier this month.\n\nObama has warned Republicans in Congress that he would act unilaterally if they continue to block comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nEarlier this year, a reform measure passed a Senate vote but was rejected by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nObama also is expected to stress that he wants to focus efforts on deportations of illegal residents with serious criminal backgrounds.\n\nIn 2013, the president visited Las Vegas' Del Sol High School, which has a large population of non-English speaking students, to unveil his blueprint for comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nA Pew Research Center study released this week found that the state of Nevada has the nation's highest proportion of illegal immigrants.

What I'm going to be laying out is things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nThe president will travel to a Las Vegas high school Friday to rally support for his actions and to detail the impact of the move in a state where Hispanics are a growing and politically powerful constituency, he announced in the video.\n\nObama has said for months that he would act to revamp the nation's immigration enforcement system if Republicans continued to block a legislative overhaul that would enhance border security, increase legal immigration and provide a path to legalization for many of the 11 million people living illegally in the United States.\n\nThe actions Obama is expected to announce will not go that far. But they will remove the threat of deportation for the parents of children who are citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States. He will also provide new guidance for the nation's immigration enforcement agents and revamp the legal immigration system to provide more opportunities for high-tech workers from other countries.\n\nAs many as 4 million immigrants living in the country illegally will get legal status from a new program similar to one that already protects undocumented people who were brought to the country as children, according to people who were briefed on the announcement by senior White House officials. The immigrants must have lived in the country for at least five years and have no criminal record.\n\nOfficials said an additional 1 million people would get protection through other parts of the president's actions.\n\nThe parents of immigrants who came as children will not receive protection under the president's actions, according to those who were briefed Wednesday. The White House officials have also told advocates that farmworkers will not be covered by the president's actions.\n\nWhite House officials have said the president remains open to signing a legislative overhaul if Republicans relent, but they said his patience had run out. By taking action now, Obama is daring the Republicans, who will take over control of Congress in January, to try to stand in the way of change that is favored by many in the growing, politically powerful Latino constituency.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner and other top Republicans have vowed to try to overturn the president's actions. But the party has been split about whether to threaten a government shutdown or an impeachment proceeding if the president moved ahead with unilateral action.",

                    "body": "Obama replied that his \"position hasn't changed\" and that the questions then were about him unilaterally enacting comprehensive immigration changes similar to the Senate bill that passed in 2013 but stalled in the House. But those questions in early 2013 weren't about a comprehensive immigration overhaul, they were about Obama taking the kinds of executive actions he is now mulling.\n\nJim Avila of ABC News, Nov. 16: Following up on immigration -- in 2010, when asked by immigration reform advocates to stop deportations and act alone on providing legal status for the undocumented, you said, \"I'm President, I'm not king. I can't do these things just by myself.\" In 2013, you said, \"I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.\" Mr. President, what has changed since then? And since you've now had a chance to talk since July with your legal advisors, what do you now believe are your limits so that you can continue to act as president and not as emperor or king?\n\nObama: Well, actually, my position hasn't changed. When I was talking to the advocates, their interest was in me, through executive action, duplicating the legislation that was stalled in Congress. And getting a comprehensive deal of the sort that is in the Senate legislation, for example, does extend beyond my legal authorities. There are certain things I cannot do. There are certain limits to what falls within the realm of prosecutorial discretion in terms of how we apply existing immigration laws.\n\nBut the questions posed to Obama earlier were very specific. They asked the president whether he had the authority to do the very kinds of things he is considering now. For weeks, Obama has been saying that if Congress fails to act on immigration, he will \"do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse.\" According to the New York Times, Obama plans to lift the threat of deportation from as many as 5 million immigrants in the country illegally -- mainly the relatives of people already in the country legally -- and to offer many of them work permits.\n\nObama's action would not permanently change a person's immigration status and would not provide a pathway to citizenship, as was proposed in the Senate immigration bill that stalled. Obama is correct that that kind of lasting, comprehensive immigration overhaul has to come through Congress. But that's not what was asked of him in the interviews back in early 2013.\n\nThe \"I'm not a king\" comment came during an interview of Obama on Univision on Jan. 30, 2013.\n\nMaria Elena Salinas of Univision: Now I know that you have reduced, this is another concern on Twitter, the number of deportations of non-criminals. However, in 2012 more than 184,000 non-criminals were deported. In the spirit of your push for immigration reform, would you consider a moratorium on deportations of non-criminals? Remember, these are your words: \"This is not about policy. It's about people.\"\n\nObama: Well, I think it is important to remind everybody that, as I said I think previously, and I'm not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law. And that's what we've done. But what I've also said is, let's make sure that we're applying the law in a way that takes into account people's humanity. That's the reason that we moved forward on deferred action. Within the confines of the law we said, we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law. The same is true with respect to the kinds of the length of time that people have to spend outside of the country when their spouses are already here for example.\n\nThe \"I'm not the emperor of the United States\" comment came during a Google Hangout interview two weeks later, on Feb. 14, 2013, (starting at the 18:42 mark).\n\nJacky Guerrero of California: Your administration has deported a record high number of 1.5 million undocumented immigrants, more than your predecessor. And I know your administration took some steps last year to protect unintended undocumented immigrants from being deported. However many people say that those efforts weren't enough. What I'd like to know is what you're going to do now until the time immigration reform is passed, to insure that more people aren't being deported and families aren't being broken apart.\n\nObama: Well, look Jacky, this is something that I've struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that, you know, I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed, and Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system.\n\nAnd what that means is is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place, even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic. And what we have been able to do is to make sure that we're focusing our enforcement resources on criminals, as opposed to somebody who's here just trying to work and look after their families.\n\nWhat we have tried to do is administratively reduce the burdens and hardships on families being separated. And what we've done is, obviously, pass the deferred action which made sure that the DREAMers, young people who were brought here and think of themselves as Americans, are American except for their papers, that they're not deported.\n\nHaving said all that, we've kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can. And that's why making sure we get comprehensive immigration reform done is so important.\n\nIn both cases, the president was asked about executive actions to remove the threat of deportations from a much larger group, to prevent the breakup of families -- the very thing Obama is proposing to do now. Then, Obama said, \"[W]e've kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can.\" Now, he believes he has the legal authority to do it.\n\nIn a similar analysis of Obama's claim that his \"position hasn't changed,\" Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler noted two other instances in which Obama previously claimed he lacked the authority to extend a freeze of deportations to a larger class of immigrants in the country illegally, or to grant temporary status.\n\nThe first came in a Univision town hall meeting on March 28, 2011, in which Obama was asked if he could \"grant temporary protective status, TPS, to undocumented students.\" Obama said that he could not.\n\nObama, 2011: With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed -- and I know that everybody here at Bell is studying hard so you know that we've got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch's job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the judiciary has to interpret the laws.\n\nThere are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president.\n\nThe other example cited by Kessler was an interview with Noticias Telemundo on Sept. 17, 2013, during which Obama was specifically asked if he would \"at least consider unilaterally freezing the deportations for parents of deferred-action kids.\" Again, Obama said he could not.\n\nObama, Sept. 17, 2013: My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said, here's the law when it comes to those who are undocumented, and they allocate a whole bunch of money for enforcement.\n\nObama continued to say that he had made the legal argument that the government did not have the resources to deport so-called DREAMers -- people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as young children. But he didn't think it was legally possible to extend that policy beyond DREAMers.\n\n\"But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally,\" Obama said. \"So that's not an option. I do get a little worried that advocates of immigration reform start losing heart and immediately thinking, well, somehow there's an out here -- if Congress doesn't act, we will just have the president sign something and that will take care of it, and we won't have to worry about it. What I have said is that there is a path to get this done and that is through Congress.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House officials insist the evolution of Obama's comments reflects a change in emphasis, rather than a change in opinion, and that at the time Obama was focused on convincing Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nWe take no position on whether Obama has the legal authority to enact the kinds of immigration changes he is considering via executive authority. Ultimately, that may have to be decided in federal courts (as Republicans have threatened a legal challenge). But then, Obama said he lacked the legal authority to suspend deportation of family members. Now, he says he has just such legal authority.\n\n- Robert Farley",

They can pay their taxes. They can go to the back of the line, but also sort of become fully contributing members of communities large and small all across the country. This is an important step that will have a pretty profound impact on the lives of millions of people who live here.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois, told CNN Wednesday that Obama is \"overstepping his power.\" Kinzinger said Obama's action would reduce the likelihood of successful immigration reform efforts in 2015 between Obama and the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nKinzinger said he is afraid that \"this whole situation is going to collapse\" if Obama acts unilaterally and suggested a better step would be for Obama to give Congress until March to pass an immigration bill.\n\nObama posted a minute-long video on his Facebook page where he said, while sitting on his desk in the Oval Office, that he would be announcing his proposal in a speech and then visit Del Sol High School where he previously laid out principles for immigration reform.",

Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long,\" Mr Obama said as he justified his decision to move on his own after a year of waiting for Congress to pass a law reforming America's immigration system.\n\nThe morning after his announcement the President will fly to Nevada, a state whose large Hispanic population helped secure his second term in the White House, to try to sell his plans.\n\nPost by The White House.\n\nRepublicans will take control of both the chambers of Congress in January and some suggested retaliating against Mr Obama by preventing him from appointing senior government officials and withhold funding for public programmes.\n\n\"It is lawless. It is unconstitutional,\" said Ted Cruz, a firebrand Republican senator who is expected to run for president in 2016. \"[Mr Obama] is defiant and angry at the American people. If he acts by executive diktat, President Obama will not be acting as a president, he will be acting as a monarch.\"\n\nThere are more than 11 million illegal immigrants, largely from Latin America, living inside the US. Many have been in the country for decades and some have children who were born in the US and are either American citizens or legal residents.\n\nMr Obama is expected to announce tonight he is protecting illegal immigrants whose children are in the country legally, ending fears that their families could be torn apart by deportation.\n\nIn 2012, he announced a smaller-scale plan that ended deportation for young people who had arrived in the US illegally as children, a group known as \"Dreamers\".\n\nActivists had hoped that the parents of Dreamers would also be protected by tonight's announcement but so far there is no indication that Mr Obama will go that far.\n\nNews of the announcement was met with mixed emotions from the community of immigration activists who have spent a year pressuring Mr Obama to take action, including heckling him during his speeches.\n\n\"Anytime you have millions of people protected that's a huge victory for the community,\" said Mario Carillo, a spokesman for the United We Dream advocacy group. \"But we're also sobered by the fact that more than half of the undocumented population remains under the threat of deportation.\"\n\nThe President's executive action is the latest chapter in a Washington saga that began after the 2012 election, in which Mr Obama won nearly three-quarters of the Hispanic vote.\n\nBoth parties returned to Washington after election and Democrats and Republicans in the Senate crafted a bill that would have overhauled America's immigration system.\n\nBut the bill was blocked by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and earlier this year Mr Obama lost patience with Congress and announced he would act on his own.\n\nRepublicans have said his unilateral plans violate the Constitution and at one point Mr Obama appeared to agree with them, telling liberal activists that he did not have the power to change the law on his own.\n\n\"I'm not a king,\" Mr Obama said last year. \"I am the head of the executive branch of government. I'm required to follow the law.\"\n\nSince then, Mr Obama has changed course and decided to unilaterally order US law enforcement to halt deportations for some illegal immigrants.",

                    "body": "President Obama appeared to be zeroing in Wednesday on a set of immigration policy changes that could protect 2.5 million to 4.9 million people from deportation, as he prepared to address the nation Thursday night to make his case for reform.\n\nThe exact number will vary depending on last-minute tweaks to the plan, which was described by an administration official and two outside advocates who were briefed on deliberations and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Obama said in a video posted on Facebook announcing his plan to speak Thursday. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problems to fester for too long. So, what I'm going to be laying out is some things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better.\"\n\nThe announcement follows months of back-and-forth involving Obama, immigration overhaul advocates and members of Congress about how to patch up a system in which an estimated 11 million people live in the U.S. without legal status.\n\nFor months, Obama has said he was holding off taking executive action in the hopes that the Republican-led House would follow the Democratic-led Senate and pass a bipartisan overhaul to the system. He delayed again during the fall campaign season to take pressure off of Democratic candidates in the midterm election.\n\nBut with his party's sweeping losses in that election and Republicans poised to take over the Senate next year, Obama returned from an overseas trip last week telling his staff he was ready to act unilaterally before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe administration refused to release specifics of the plan Wednesday, but it has already riled critics who question whether Obama is overstepping his executive authority by ordering a change that could directly affect millions of people.\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio referred to the president as \"Emperor Obama\" in a statement accusing him of a \"legacy of lawlessness,\" a jab at Obama's own comment nearly two years ago when he discussed the restraints on his power.\n\nObama said in his Facebook video that he still hoped to work out a solution with Congress, but that only added fuel to the fiery criticism building on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"He's trying to pick a bar fight,\" Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said.\n\n\"I used to do political campaigns. I know when the aim is to divide,\" added Cole, a former pollster. \"That's the game he's playing. He's not trying to come to an agreement.\"\n\nAdvisors to Obama argue that he isn't overstepping the bounds of his executive authority. Every president since Eisenhower has used the power of the executive branch to tweak U.S. immigration policy, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday.\n\nObama's move, he said, would be \"consistent with actions taken by presidents of both parties to deal with the immigration system.\"\n\nUnder the plan, the White House would halt the deportation of millions of parents of U.S. citizens and long-term permanent residents, according to those briefed on the plan.\n\nThat program, to be rolled out in phases over its first year in order to prevent a crush of applications, would allow immigrants who qualify to pay a fee and submit to a background check and be given a temporary reprieve from deportation.\n\nThe number of people eligible will depend on residency requirements. If the guidelines call for five years of living in the U.S., 3.3 million people could be eligible to be protected from deportation. If the requirement is set at 10 years, 2.5 million would be eligible.\n\nA small but significant option that was taken off the table was a change to policy that would have protected parents of children who received work permits through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Such a change was seen as too difficult to defend legally and politically.\n\nKeeping out that group of parents could reduce the number of people eligible for assistance by about 100,000, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\n\n\"We were disappointed with that,\" said Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA de Maryland, an advocacy group. \"All of us are very clear this is a step in the right direction, what the president is doing. We celebrate that. But that is not enough. We're going to keep fighting.\"\n\nObama created the deferred action program two years ago, allowing more than 580,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to be protected from deportation for two years. They can seek extensions.\n\nAnother possible modification Obama may announce, a change to the deferred action program's age limit, could affect hundreds of thousands more people in the country illegally.\n\n\"It will be a mixed-emotions day,\" said Lorella Praeli, a policy director for United We Dream, an advocacy organization that pushes for protections for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, as well as their families.\n\nObama is also expected to allow several hundred thousand spouses of U.S. citizens to more easily apply for waivers to a policy that would keep them out of the country and away from their family members before they could get legal status to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also revamped instructions to immigration officers that boosts the number of people considered low priorities for deportation. Depending on the changes, this could protect an additional 200,000 to half a million people from being deported over the next 10 years.\n\nObama's plan may also make it easier for foreigners on work visas to apply for long-term permanent residency. Workers from other countries could be allowed to apply for green cards and work in the U.S. while their applications are being reviewed.\n\nEven with the executive order ready to go, one White House official said the president was ready to tear it up if Congress will take action.\n\nDemocrats didn't seem to be holding out hope.\n\n\"If the House votes on our bipartisan bill, the discussion about executive action would be made moot,\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), one of the authors of the Senate bill. \"It is the other body of Congress that has led us to the point we're at today.\"",

                    "body": "His patience exhausted with the failure of Congress to pass a package to reform America's hodgepodge and often cruel immigration laws, President Barack Obama said tonight that he will unveil measures of his own in a broadcast to the nation tomorrow night.\n\nWhite House officials refused to give details of what Mr Obama will be announcing but indicated that the measures, which he will take under his own authority by executive order, thus bypassing Congress altogether, would protect roughly five million undocumented people from deportation.\n\nThere was a swift chorus of fury from Republicans on Capitol who said that by going through with his threat to act alone on immigration he was dooming any chance of cooperation with the new Republican-controlled Congress that will come into being on 1 January on that or any other issue.\n\nMr Obama will spell out his plans in the televised broadcast and will follow up with a visit to a high school in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Friday to rally the support of minority voters.\n\nWhile Republican disdain is sure to mount, supporters of immigration reform are not likely to see everything they have been asking for either. In particular, it appears that while Mr Obama's actions will remove the risk of deportation from about five million undocumented people in the country and offer them work permits it will not afford them federal benefits, particularly insurance benefits for healthcare.\n\nImmigrants and activists demonstrating in New Orleans (AP)\n\nThe largest group to feel the effects of the action will be roughly four million illegal residents who have children who were born in the US who have themselves become legal. Other parts of what he will propose will affect about one million more people, officials indicated. They said it would not apply to agricultural workers here illegally who are important in particular to California's economy.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million undocumented people living the US who live in the shadows, permanently unwilling to come forward and participate in society in any way that might alert the authorities to their existence. Often they have family members in their country of origin, mostly Mexico and Central American states, who they can never visit for fear of not being allowed back in.\n\nMany corporations, particularly in the technology sector, have also long complained that the labyrinthine visa rules in this country have starved them of much needed talent from overseas.\n\n\"Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken,\" Mr Obama said in the video on Facebook and the White House website. \"Unfortunately, Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long. What I'm going to be laying out is things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.\"\n\nIt is unclear how far the Republicans might go to retaliate but already there is talk of action to block a new budget bill that has to be passed by 11 December to fund the US government. A new government shutdown could be the most damaging fall-out. Republicans could also do everything they can to block confirmations for new nominees for government posts, including Attorney General.\n\nRepublican congressman Paul Ryan (AP)\n\n\"I think it would do great damage in his relations with Congress,\" Paul Ryan, the Republican congressman and former vice presidential candidate, said, calling on Mr Obama to acknowledge the new advantage that will be given to Republicans by voters in this month's midterm elections.\n\n\"If he chooses to do this, we will see this as a move for him to play 2016 politics, to try and help his party versus our party, instead of working and coming to common ground with Republicans in 2015 to get things done, which is what I think the voters told us they want in this very last election.\"\n\nWhile a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have laid out a pathway for illegal immigrants to achieve legal residency in the US, if not actual citizenship, was passed by the US Senate, the House of Representatives, already under Republican control, has refused to take it up. The common case made is that the border with Mexico has to be properly sealed before any relaxation of the rules.\n\nFor Mr Obama, however, the immigration issue has become central to his own hopes of leaving office with a more than meagre legacy. He made clear earlier this year that he could no longer wait for the Republicans in the House to move on the issue and was ready to act on his own in so far as he has the power to. He said he would take no steps until after the midterm elections, however.",

The Republican-controlled Congress will pass a series of spending bills that will limit the president's ability to spend on Social Security cards for illegal immigrants.

                    "body": "The political consequences of President Obama's new immigration plan will probably depend on whether Americans focus on the merits of the policy or on the president's audacious means of achieving it.\n\nDemocrats say that Obama's action, which would protect millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, is necessary to keep the faith of Latinos, the nation's fastest-growing minority and a crucial voting bloc for their party in recent elections.\n\nFor Republicans, the move represents confirmation that the president is constantly overreaching, with contempt for the concerns of those who disagree with him. At the same time, GOP leaders worry that an overreaction on their own side -- shutting down the government over the immigration issue, for instance -- could backfire and raise questions about their capacity to govern just as they are poised to take full control of Capitol Hill.\n\nA chorus of Republicans on Wednesday accused Obama of behaving like a monarch -- or, as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) put it, \"emperor of the United States.\" They pointed to a litany of Obama's own past statements to make their case, noting that he often said there were limits to what he could do in the absence of a comprehensive new immigration law.\n\nWhile there are decades of precedent for executives -- both Democratic and Republican -- claiming leeway in choosing which immigration cases to pursue, none has applied \"prosecutorial discretion\" as broadly as Obama is expected to do.\n\nObama will argue that his policy is simply an acknowledgment of practical reality: that the government's limited resources should be devoted to dealing with the cases that pose the greatest public safety threat, and that Congress itself has failed to act.\n\nA comprehensive immigration bill passed the Democratic-led Senate in June 2013, but the GOP-majority House has not moved on the issue.\n\nIn the absence of legislation, \"the president is somebody who is willing to examine the law, review the law and use every element of that law to make progress for the American people,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday. \"If that is something that Republicans are critical of, then that's .\u2009.\u2009. a criticism that the president wears with a badge of honor.\"\n\nPolitically, Obama has little choice: He had promised for months to undertake this kind of executive action, which will be an expansion of his 2012 decision to protect from deportation hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the country illegally as children.\n\n\"He has boxed himself in completely,\" said William Galston, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who was a top domestic policy adviser in Bill Clinton's White House. \"Politically speaking, there has been a promissory note outstanding for a long time.\"\n\nWere Obama to fail to follow through, Galston said, he would not only lose credibility, but could damage his party's relationship with Latinos.\n\n\"The road to the White House comes through the [Hispanic] community in critical states,\" said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). He added that unless Republicans come up with their own proposal for fixing the immigration system, \"they're in trouble.\"\n\nThe public has been largely supportive of a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system and sympathetic to the idea of creating a pathway to citizenship for the more than 11 million illegal immigrants who are estimated to be living in the United States.\n\nBut a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Wednesday found deep misgivings about Obama's expected executive action. Nearly half of those surveyed -- 48 percent -- said they disapprove of the president acting alone on immigration, and only 38 percent said they approved of it.\n\nFormer housing secretary Henry Cisneros, a supporter of the president's action, predicted that opposition will fade. Those who benefit, he said, will be grateful for generations -- as he said many Latinos feel toward President Ronald Reagan for the amnesty program he signed into law in 1986.\n\n\"While the breadth of anger will be wide, the intensity of the benefits will be deep,\" Cisneros said.\n\nUnivision, the widely watched Spanish-language channel, has agreed to delay a portion of the 15th annual Latin Grammys in order to carry Obama's announcement.\n\nBecause it is not written into law, the reprieve that Obama grants will by definition be temporary. And Republicans say the action will make it all the more difficult to pass a permanent new law.\n\n\"If 'Emperor Obama' ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for congressional action on this issue -- and many others,\" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).\n\nMany Republicans noted that Democrats controlled both houses of Congress in the early years of the Obama administration and failed to pass an immigration bill.\n\n\"We've gone to the president and said, 'Give us time to do immigration reform, to work on the issue this year. We want to get this done.' And this is the reaction he has to that?\" said Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the 2012 vice presidential candidate. \"He had two years with a super-majority of his own party, and he didn't lift a finger. And now he won't give us a few weeks? He's basically choosing to give us a partisan bomb.\"\n\nBut if it detonates, Republicans realize that they could be the ones injured.\n\n\"Republicans have to handle this in a sensitive way,\" said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah). He warned that any of them who speaks of impeaching the president over immigration would be shunned by most in the party and \"considered pretty erratic and pretty excessive.\"\n\nTwo Republicans who are mulling presidential bids, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), cautioned their colleagues to focus on fighting the policy, rather than on fiery rebuttals that could alienate the voters the party must woo in 2016.\n\n\"Pass some things,\" Paul said, when asked about how the party should react. He suggested an expansion of work visas as an example of one potential piece of legislation.\n\n\"No one in our leadership team is interested in shutting down the government,\" Portman said. \"Many of us believe the immigration system is broken and we'd like to fix it, and we'd like to work with the president on that.\"\n\nRobert Costa and Lori Montgomery contributed to this report.",

And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.\"\n\nSix years later, with President Obama set to deliver a prime time address to announce his executive action on immigration, here is a look at how we got here:\n\nApril 2009In response to a question about the one-year deadline Obama says that he saw the \"process moving this first year.\"June 2009Obama assigns Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework.September 2009Obama says he anticipated \"that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\"January 2010\"We should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system - to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation,\" Obama says in his State of the Union address.Sept 20, 2012During a September 2012 town hall with Fusion's Jorge Ramos the president is cornered on the lack of action seen in his first term: \"You promised that [reform would come in first term] and a promise is a promise. And with all due respect, you didn't keep that promise,\" Ramos said.\"As you remind me, my biggest failure is that we haven't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done,\" Obama responded. \"So we're going to be continuing to work on that. But it's not for lack of trying or desire.\"\n\nFebruary 14, 2013In a Google Hangout, President Obama says: \"The problem is that I'm the president of the United States, I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.\"June 11, 2013The same day the Senate voted 84 to 15 to bring the so-called \"Gang of Eight's\" immigration bill to the floor the President comments on how it \"isn't perfect. It's a compromise. ... And going forward, nobody is going to get everything that they want -- not Democrats, not Republicans, not me. But this is a bill that's largely consistent with the principles that I and the people on this stage have laid out for common-sense reform.\"June 30,2014A year since the Senate passed their bill and the House had yet to bring it up for a vote, Obama said: \"If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours. I expect their recommendations before the end of summer and I intend to adopt those recommendations without further delay.\"Sept 6, 2014The end of the summer was approaching, and still no action had been taken. In an NBC Interview he said: I'm going to act because it's the right thing for the country.\"\"But it's going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration,\" he said. And with that the deadline moved.\n\nNovember 2, 2014He wasn't talking immigration, but after a protester interrupted him during a rally for Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, the president gave his first glimpse of his planned executive action.\"Hold on, young lady. Hold on a second. Hold on. Hold on. You're a DREAMer, and I gave you relief administratively, and we're going to work on the next one. The Republicans are blocking immigration reform. That's one more reason why we need a Democratic Senate,\" he said. \"So I support you. I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. And you need to go protest the Republicans. Because I'm not the one blocking it.\"\n\nNovember 5, 2014The elections had passed and still no action: \"What I'm not going to do is just wait,\" Obama said. \"Think it's fair to say I've shown a lot of patience.\"November 16, 2014At the G20 Summit in Australia, Obama was asked if his position from 2013 (\"I'm not the emperor of the United States\") had changed: \"Give me a bill that addresses [immigration], and I'll be the first one to sign it and metaphorically I'll crumple up whatever executive actions that we take,\" he said.",

Obama will announce his plans in a prime time TV address that will also be streaming online at 5 p.m. PST Thursday.\n\nHis trip on Friday to Del Sol High School will serve as a rally for his reforms, which are unpopular with the new Republican Congress.\n\n\"Our immigration system has been broken for decades -- and every minute we fail to act, millions of people who live in the shadows but want to play by the rules and pay taxes have no way to live right by the law and contribute to our country,\" wrote White House spokesperson Josh Earnest in a blog post today.\n\nSen. Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat and Senate leader since 2007, praised Obama's decision to move forward without Congress. He spoke on the Senate floor Wednesday and issued a statement on Obama's visit to Las Vegas, which will also feature Reid.\n\n\"This is personal to me,\" Reid said in a statement. \"There is no issue I have worked on more in my time as Democratic leader than immigration reform.\"\n\nAll week, Reid has reiterated his belief the president has the constitutional authority to take action. Republicans, however, say such executive action would be overstepping Obama's bounds and could make working with the new Republican Congress more difficult.\u200b\n\nNevada is an important swing state with about a third of the population Hispanic or Latino, according to U.S. Census Data. Those voters could be key for 2016 presidential contenders and Reid's own reelection campaign, but many hoping for a change in the nation's immigration reform policy are disenfranchised by both Congress' and President Obama's inaction. Immigration reform passed last year in the Senate but has been stalled in the Republican-controlled House. Obama said this summer he would act on his own, but he controversially delayed any action until after the November elections.\n\nPresident Obama has been to Las Vegas before to speak about immigration reform. He visited Del Sol High School in January 2013 to lay out a plan.\n\nNevada has the highest percentage of illegal immigrants in its public school system of any other state, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center.\n\nNevada is also run by Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who is the first Hispanic elected to statewide office in the state.",

An abuse of power!\" Cornyn said. \"His unilateral action, which is unconstitutional and illegal, will be deeply harmful to our nation's tradition of the rule of law, and deeply harmful to the future of our democracy.\"\n\nThe president insists he is acting only because Congress has passed no legislation whatsoever to reform America's much-criticized immigration system. That point was echoed by Democratic Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, who noted that the only immigration reform bill to pass either chamber in more than a decade -- a comprehensive Senate bill approved last year -- has gone nowhere in the House.\n\n\"The Republican-led House of Representatives has failed to have a hearing on this bill, has refused to bring this bill to the floor, has refused to bring any immigration bill to the floor,\" Durbin said. \"They refuse to address the obvious: We have a broken immigration system. And they refuse to act.\"\n\nKeep families together\n\nObama is expected to defer deportations for millions of foreign citizens living illegally in the United States who have U.S.-born children. Such a move would prevent families from being split apart, but would fall short of the comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration laws most lawmakers say is needed. Only Congress can change federal law.\n\nWashington officials said Obama's plans, to be unveiled Thursday in Las Vegas, could pertain to as many as five million people. These immigrants would be allowed to stay in the country and work but would not be entitled to federal benefits.\n\nRepublicans like Cornyn say an immigration overhaul is still possible, but not if Obama short-circuits the political process by acting on his own.\n\n\"The message that the president and our Democratic friends have given is: We give up. We are not going to do our job as legislators,\" Cornyn said. \"We are going to let the president with the stroke of a pen provide an executive amnesty to millions of people.\"\n\nPrecedent for action\n\nNot so, according to Durbin, who noted that Obama would not be the first president to act on immigration.\n\n\"Every president of the United States since Dwight D. Eisenhower has used his executive authority to improve our immigration system,\" Durbin said. \"Every single one of them. President George H.W. Bush issued a family fairness policy allowing 1.5 million people in America to apply for deferred action and work permits. It is clear that presidents have the authority to do this.\"\n\nWhich side is correct? That may be left to the judiciary to decide, as Republicans have promised to challenge any executive order on immigration in federal court. For now, all eyes in the debate are on the White House, where Obama has the next move.",

The aim to block the president's go-solo actions, which are expected to help up to five million illegal immigrants, but not alienate a public fed up with dysfunctional national politics with too extreme a reaction.\n\nHurt by last year's government shutdown over their opposition to Mr Obama's signature healthcare law, the party is weighing how to counter his expected executive actions that would bypass Republican opposition in the House of Representatives and their refusal to take up a cross-party Senate immigration bill.\n\nMr Obama has long threatened to fix a broken immigration system on his own terms if House speaker John Boehner and his fellow Republicans in Congress fail to draft their own legislation.\n\nMr Boehner has refused to take up a bill on immigration, a lightning rod issue in the stormy partisanship of Washington politics, and has warned the president that executive action would \"poison the well.\"\n\nHe will make a televised address at 8pm tonight on his plans, he said, \"laying out the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better.\"\n\nMr Obama plans to make a speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas tomorrow to rally support for his initiative. The location points to the significance of the announcement - the president gave a major speech on immigration at the school in January 2013, a week after his second inauguration.\n\nNevada is also the home state of Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid, who will make way for Republican Mitch McConnell as the next Senate majority leader after the GOP won back the chamber in this month's midterm elections.\n\nAs many as five million people are reportedly expected to benefit from the move, out of the estimated 11.4 million illegal immigrants in the US.\n\nThe executive actions represent an expansion of the 2012 measure introduced by Mr Obama to allow children who were brought to the US illegally as children, known as Dreamers, to remain in the country.\n\nNobody knows the exact number of illegal Irish - or, indeed, the number of Irish who will be helped by Mr Obama's executive orders - but they are expected to total \"some thousands,\" said one US-based Irish immigration activist who declined to be identified.\n\nRepublicans must tread a fine line between following through on their objections to the president's \"executive amnesty\" without estranging ethnic minorities, which have become a growing political force.\n\nOne proposal floated by some Republicans is a little- used \"rescission bill\". This would allow them to approve a must-pass spending bill by December 11th to keep the government open, then retrospectively strip out specific funding for immigration. This would hobble the president's proposals.\n\n\"We went down the government shutdown route a year ago. It didn't work, and I think a lot of people that recall that don't think it's wise to repeat that exercise,\" congressman Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma, told the New York Times.\n\n\"We've got a lot more than just a sledgehammer in the toolbox, and so let's use some of these other weapons that we have.\"",

                    "body": "President Barack Obama is expected to sign an executive order issuing work permits to 5 million migrants any day now.\n\nBloomberg News said Tuesday evening that the mandate could be handed down as early as Thursday and would cover illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and parents of American citizen children. As many as 5 million illegal immigrants would be saved from deportation under the plan shared with the news outlet.\n\nSimilarly, Politico said administration sources confirmed that the announcement will come this week and will be followed up on Friday with an event in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe news reports reignited fury among congressional Republicans, with House Speaker John Boehner's office calling the president 'Emperor Obama' in an email.\n\nA Democratic congressman with knowledge of the president's plans also suggested on Tuesday night that Obama would protect parents of citizen children in his imminently expected executive order.\n\nMeanwhile, immigration groups said the White House on Tuesday held conference calls with them to preview the president's long anticipated announcement, which at least one participant on the call believed come as early as today.\n\n'They're setting expectations, making it clear he has the legal authority to do what he's going to do, but that he's not going beyond his authority, as some advocates would like,' a source familiar with the calls told The Hill.\n\nThe White House declined on Tuesday to say if Obama had made any concrete decisions about the contents of his executive order, but the immigration advocate who spoke to the Hill said that based on the timing of the phone call, Obama likely has.\n\n'My guess is whatever they have teed up is already ready,' the source said.\n\nCongressman Luis Gutierrez also implied this week that president Obama had mostly made up his mind, telling MSNBC on Monday that the president's declaration is 'going to be big.'\n\n'I don't want to say more than that. I've been, as you know, we've spoken before. I said it was going to be at least five million before. And it seems that that's going to be a number that we're looking at,' he told network host Alex Wagner.\n\n'Look, I cannot tell you any more than that,' he added.\n\nBy Tuesday evening he seemed more sure of the president's plans, however, telling O'Reilly Factor host Bill O'Reilly that he thinks the president will issue two-year work permits to migrants with citizen children.\n\n'I think, Bill, the president is going to choose between five and 10 years, that is that you have to be in the United States for five to 10 years and you have to been working here, and you are going to pay for [a] background check,' Gutierrez divulged.\n\n'You're going to submit your fingerprints and if they come back clear, he is going to give you a work authorization for two years and a Social Security card. He's going to put you on the books paying taxes.'\n\nThat provision, Gutierrez said, would protect 3 million people from deportation. Other measures would provide pathways to legal residency for agricultural and high tech workers.\n\nBloomberg also affirmed that the federal government would give 29-month work permits to foreign graduates of U.S. universities with STEM degrees - science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nMultiple news reports last week revealed that Obama was considering a sweeping executive order that would have allowed the parents of illegal immigrant children to stay in the U.S. indefinitely, as well.\n\nMore recent reports would indicate that the president has backed off from that measure, which Obama himself had said would be illegal.\n\nObama, a constitutional lawyer, had in the past excused himself from halting deportations for large swaths of immigrant populations because the president is neither a 'king' nor an emperor.\n\nAnd while he has already ordered immigration officials to stop deporting many illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, Obama said an expansion of that order to their parents or the entire illegal immigrant population in the U.S. would exceed his authority as president.\n\nThe old statements prompted a sparring match between the White House and reporters on Tuesday, with White House spokesman Josh Earnest refusing to say during his daily briefing whether Obama had changed his mind about the power of the presidency.\n\nHe also refused to provide legal justification for Obama's planned actions, telling reporters they'd have to wait until a formal announcement was made to receive supplemental materials.\n\nEarnest's evasive responses further muddled an issue that Obama had already addressed himself during an overseas press conference on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Brisbane, Australia, the president claimed he had not changed his position. Furthermore, Obama said the Office of Legal Counsel had since concluded that he does have power to reallocate resources and reprioritize which categories of illegal residents will be deported first 'since we can't do everything.'\n\nRepublicans in Congress disagree. 'If \"Emperor Obama\" ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue - and many others,' Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in an email on Wednesday morning,\n\nGOP lawmakers have referred to Obama's actions in the past as 'illegal amnesty,' and they are actively looking for ways to block his executive actions. including filing charges against him in court.\n\nThe leading strategy is to insert language into a crucial spending bill that would require the president to follow immigration laws or having the Department of Homeland Security's funding rescinded.\n\nBoehner said at a press conference last week that 'all options are on the table,' however, and Republicans still hadn't agreed on a strategy to challenge Obama.",

                    "body": "The strangest thing has happened. As everyone knows, Barack Obama's world turned upside down on Nov. 4. But then came the unexpected: The world kept spinning until, eventually, Obama somehow found himself on top.\n\nIf history is any guide, Obama may not stay there for long. But in what should be the afterglow of the Republicans' huge midterm victory, the news instead is all about Obama. And some of it, shockingly, is even good.\n\nThe China-climate pact? Yep. All the chatter is about how Obama's surprise agreement with the Chinese leaves the Republicans flat-footed and all but flat-earthed. Forget the I-am-not-a-scientist shtick. The Republican to watch now is Sen. Jim Inhofe, the unabashed climate denier who says the whole thing is, and I quote, a \"hoax.\" This is the same Inhofe who is expected to resume his chairmanship of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I hope you've got cable, because C-SPAN 2 is going to be some must-see TV.\n\nThe immigration-reform standoff? Obviously, this is about Obama. And here's how this thing might well play out: When Obama makes his big speech on executive authority, don't be surprised if he asks Republicans to please do the right thing and pass an immigration-reform bill that would make his reluctantly-invoked executive orders go away. And what will be the Republicans' excuse for not doing that? Because they don't want Obama to get a victory? I'll leave it to Cory Gardner to judge whether that's mature.\n\nThe vote on Keystone? Yeah, that's about Obama, too. I don't know if this is a winner for Obama, but it's a loser for Mary Landrieu, who called for the vote -- and got it as a favor from Harry Reid -- in a desperate attempt to save her Senate seat by showing her constituents in Louisiana that she can be as much in the clutches of Big Oil as any Republican.\n\nIf Obama has to veto the bill, he'll at least make environmentalists happy. Of course, you'd assume that when Republicans take control of the Senate next year, they'll be able to make a deal with Obama to get the pipeline. Oh wait - that means they'd actually have to make a deal with Obama.\n\nLook, the story here should be what Republicans plan to do next. Except that, as far as I can tell, they don't plan to do anything next. Here's the agenda: They're going to stop Obama's nominations. They're going to vote to repeal Obamacare -- or is it Grubercare? -- and hope that all the Obama vetoes will be used somehow against Hillary Clinton, unless, of course, the Supreme Court gets there first. And they're going to weigh shutting down the government -- in response to Obama's moves on immigration -- while in actuality setting up the real showdown, the one between John Boehner and Ted Cruz.\n\nIn the meantime, they have Charles Krauthammer -- one of the conservative wise men - on Fox talking about impeachment, just because it's Fox. It was not impeachable, apparently, when Reagan and Bush Sr. decided to use executive authority to defer deportation for 1.5 million illegal immigrants. I guess you have to get to 5 million before it counts.\n\nI'm no constitutional scholar (although my law professor daughter does advise me, and for free), but Ross Douthat, the very sharp New York Times conservative columnist, accuses Obama of committing a great betrayal. I'm not sure how he gets there. Let's say that Obama's executive orders might be an overreach. Let's say that even though other presidents have taken similar steps, Obama's large strides might be a step too great.\n\nWe can even go a step further. There's an article in the Times showing how the best arguments against Obama's position have actually been put forward by, yes, Obama himself.\n\nAsked, for example, during a Google Hangout last year if he could more to keep immigrant families from being \"broken apart,\" Obama answered: \"This is something that I have struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is, is that I'm the president of the United States, I'm not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.\"\n\nNow he says that he can bypass Congress, and bypass being an emperor, by invoking prosecutorial discretion. You definitely have to agree with at least one Obama here.\n\nBut you also have to ask yourself who is doing the betraying. It was pure politics that stopped the House from voting on the Senate immigration reform bill -- passed 68-to-32. This is an enforcement-first, fence-building, drone-flying, wait-10-years-for-a-green-card, back-of-the-line, pay-a-fine, English-first bill that begged Republicans to vote for it. If you didn't vote for it, you had to believe either that, as Mitt Romney put it, the 11 million immigrants here illegally would self-deport or the U.S. government was prepared go into full human-roundup mode. Let's call it immigration-denial.\n\nYou can argue motives. Certainly, the Democrats have made promises to Latino voters that they haven't kept. But for Obama, who doesn't have any more elections, this has to be about legacy and maybe even about doing the right thing. Obama's so-called betrayal would mean removing 5 million people from fear. Does searching for a way to make that happen -- in such a way that the lawyers assure him is constitutional -- really constitute a betrayal?\n\nWhat's clear is that, in terms of politics and of plain old justice, Boehner and company should have put the immigration issue behind them a year ago. Instead, they put Obama in position for history, not to mention most Latino voters, to judge him the winner.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON * Any chance for detente between President Obama and the incoming Republican majorities in the Congress will be tested by Obama's unilateral action on immigration, with St. Louis-area members of Congress playing key roles in the aftermath.\n\nPartisan divisions among those members were sharpening even before Obama announced on Facebook Wednesday that he would outline orders granting temporary legal relief to millions of undocumented immigrants in a primetime Thursday night speech.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, urged Obama on in a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday morning.\n\nDurbin blamed House Republicans for not considering a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last year, and said that \"for the good of the American people,\" Obama \"must use his authority under current law to do what he can to fix our broken immigration system.\"\n\nThe statement provides a glimpse of Durbin's future role in the number-two post in Senate minority, that of chief counterpoint to the GOP majority.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, a member of the House Republican leadership, co-signed a letter to Obama urging the president to hold off. Repeating other Republican leaders' warnings, the letter said an executive action would sour the atmosphere in Congress and go back on Obama's post-election promise to work with the Republican House and Senate in 2015.\n\nWagner will be a whip and representative of the sophomore Republicans in the House next year, roles that include GOP message-shaping.\n\n\"While Congress certainly understands the need for reforms to the current system, it is imperative that we work together to pass legislation that improves our immigration system, increases border security and disincentivizes undocumented immigrants from illegally entering the United States,\" the letter said. \"Any unilateral action taken by the Administration will impede our efforts.\"\n\nSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., who will be fifth in line in Republican leadership when the party runs the Senate next year, told Missouri reporters Wednesday morning that he hoped Obama would emulate Bill Clinton and work with the new Republican Senate and the strengthened Republican House, as Clinton did in forging deals on welfare reform, trade, and other issues.\n\n\"Divided government is the best time to do hard things,\" Blunt said. Blunt has been one of the GOP's top Senate critics of how Obama works -- or doesn't work -- with Congress.\n\nHe said Wednesday in a speech on the Senate floor that an Obama executive order on immigration would be \"overstepping his authority\" and a violation of the Constitution's dictates that a president \"faithfully execute\" the laws of the land.\n\n\"Ignoring the voters -- an incredible tragedy in a democracy,\" Blunt said. \"Ignoring the law -- even a more incredible tragedy in a constitutional democracy.\"\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., will wait to react until she hears Obama's speech, her spokesman John LaBombard said.\n\nOn Sunday, McCaskill told CBS \"Face the Nation\" host Bob Schieffer that she was \"not crazy about\" the possibility of an executive order from Obama, and expressed hope that the new Congress in 2015 could work more collaboratively with political opponents, and the White House.\n\nMcCaskill's reaction to the speech will be important because, since the election, she has shown a willingness to buck her party's leadership, which she said should have gotten the message from voters that the status quo is not working.\n\nShe was one of six Senate Democrats who opposed naming Nevada Sen. Harry Reid as Senate Minority Leader in 2015. Reid has been an outspoken supporter of Obama taking the unilateral move on immigration the president is preparing to announce.",

He's expected to talk about his plan Thursday night, and release the entire plan on Friday.\n\nRepublicans have been considering ways to stop Obama with legislation, including by preventing the federal government from spending any money to implement Obama's plan. The GOP hasn't set out a clear plan for doing so, and some are considering legislation after the new Congress convenes next year.\n\nHowever, Obama's decision to announce his plan this week could force Republicans to try attaching immigration language to the spending bill at the end of this year. While GOP leaders have said they don't want a government shutdown, a shutdown is possible if Congress can't find a way to combine immigration and the spending bill in a way that's acceptable to both parties.\n\nThe two GOP chairmen weren't specific, but warned that they would have no choice but to push through legislation in some form to stop Obama.\n\n\"Let's secure the border, enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States, and build a broad consensus for immigration reform,\" they said. \"Otherwise, as chairmen of the committees with oversight over border security and our nation's immigration laws, we will be forced to use the tools afforded to Congress by the Constitution to stop your administration from successfully carrying out your plan.\"\n\nRead their letter to Obama here:",

                    "body": "The venue for Obama's immigration announcement shows that 2014 is done and 2016 is here.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is returning to familiar ground for his big immigration announcement on Friday: Del Sol High School.\n\nThe Las Vegas school was where Obama first launched his campaign to overhaul the immigration system in January 2013. While symbolic for policy reasons, the setting also serves as a powerful reminder to Republicans that the midterms, with their over-representation of older white voters, are over and 2016 has begun. Traditionally, Democrats do better during presidential election years because key parts of their base -- Latinos, single women, and young people -- are more likely to come out to the polls.\n\nFor Democrats thinking about the 2016 races, there's no better place to set an immigration speech than a high school with a two-thirds Hispanic population in a swing state. Nevada has one of the fast-growing Latino populations, an influx that's shifted the state's politics towards Democrats in recent cycles. By the way, it's also in the home state of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the soon-to-be out of power Senate leader who may face a tough reelection fight against Republican Governor Brian Sandoval. \"This is personal to me,\" Reid said in a statement on Wednesday. \"There is no better place than Nevada for President Obama to outline the actions he is taking to keep families together, improve the economy and protect our national security.\"\n\nReid isn't the only Democratic candidate cheering Obama's pick. With Senate races in Colorado, Nevada and Florida, all of which are also key presidential battlegrounds, Latinos will be a particularly important demographic in 2016. In 2012, Obama won 71 percent of Latino voters, a margin that gave an edge in those states even as their economies struggled to recover. Democrats, particularly Hillary Clinton advisers, want to maintain that lead.\n\nOf course, nearly two years ago, Obama's pitch was slightly different.\n\n\"At this moment, it looks like there's a genuine desire to get this done soon, and that's very encouraging,\" he said then. \"Now, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process. But it's important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place. And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away. \"\n\nSince then, much has changed in Washington. Obama's push for a Senate immigration bill was killed by House Republicans. Democrats were trounced in the midterm elections, losing control of the Senate. And now, Obama finds himself going it alone. Even a dinner Wednesday at the White House with congressional Democrats is simply an opportunity for the president to detail his proposal -- not debate it. There won't be \"a lot of horse-trading or back-and-forth\" tonight, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said today. \"This is more of an opportunity for the president to share his thinking.\"\n\nTop Senate Democrats seem fine with that arrangement. On Monday, Democratic leaders sent a letter to Obama backing up his legal authority to take unilateral action and urging him to \"improve as much of the immigration system\" as possible. \"I believe the President should go big, as big as he can go,\" Reid said in an interview with Spanish news station Univision on Tuesday. On Friday, Reid plans to attend the president's address, and though it's Obama who will be center stage in Nevada, the senator will certainly not be the only Democratic politician trying to capture a bit of the reflected political glow.",

Obama said the Republican refusal to move on immigration was forcing his action, to be announced in a televised address on Thursday.\n\nDemocratic Senator Jon Tester of Montana said he would like to see Congress try again.\n\n\"I would prefer the Congress acted, yes,\" Tester said. \"I think it would be great to have the House take up the Senate-passed bill .... That would be a solution to the problem.\"\n\nManchin also said he would like to see the House tackle the issue again, and \"if that's not going to happen, then we've got to find another way to work this.\"\n\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday that Obama's executive action would ruin the chances of Congress acting on immigration.\n\nSenator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been supportive of immigration reform but critical of unilateral action by Obama. A spokesman for King said the senator had conveyed his position to the White House earlier this week.\n\nSome Republican conservatives have suggested placing funding restrictions on Obama's plan in a must-pass government spending bill, which could lead to a government shutdown that Republican leaders have vowed to avoid. Other approaches include passing targeted bills to defund implementation of the order.\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted the instinct for \"political survival\" would force some unhappy Democrats to join Republicans in trying to defund Obama's executive action.\n\n\"There will be some Democrats who will join the effort to limit an overreach of executive authority,\" Graham said.\n\n\"Some will be genuinely upset, a lot of it will be political survival, like in purple and red states,\" he said, referring to the colors commonly used to designate conservative-leaning and swing states.\n\nModerate Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said Obama was making \"a huge mistake from both the political and policy perspective.\"\n\nAsked if any Democrats agreed with her, Collins said: \"I know for a fact that they do.\"",

                    "body": "BRISBANE, Australia (AP) - After a productive trip abroad, President Barack Obama returned home Sunday on a collision course with Republicans on immigration and an oil pipeline project, showdowns that threaten prospects for cooperation over his remaining two years in office.\n\nThe contentious immigration debate could mean a year-end fight over keeping the government running, if some GOP lawmakers get their way.\n\nOn the foreign policy front, there is a Nov. 24 deadline in nuclear negotiations with Iran, and questions are surfacing within the administration about whether to overhaul U.S. policy toward Syria.\n\nGiven his faltering political support in the U.S. and his party's recent election losses, his trip to China, Myanmar and Australia appeared to offer respite.\n\nThe president, who arrived in Washington late Sunday, basked in policy breakthroughs with China and warm welcomes in Myanmar and Australia.\n\n\"I intend to build on that momentum when I return home,\" Obama said at a news conference before heading home.\n\nWhen Obama set off for the Asia Pacific, both the White House and Republicans were suggesting that the GOP's decisive takeover of the Senate could pave the way for bipartisan breakthroughs. But just two weeks after the election, that optimism largely has faded, making it increasingly likely that Washington will churn through two more years of gridlock.\n\nRepublicans attribute the swift shift in tone largely to Obama's plans to move forward with executive actions on immigration that potentially could shield from deportation about 5 million immigrants who are living in the United States illegally. The president has pledged to announce the measures before year's end; he could act shortly after returning to Washington.\n\nThe incoming Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has warned that such executive actions would \"poison the well\" with the new Republican-led Senate and could prevent the GOP from working with Obama on other potential areas of agreement.\n\nRepublican leaders are considering what to do if Obama presses ahead. More conservative members want to use upcoming spending bills to block the president, but that could set the stage for a showdown for another government shutdown.\n\nObama said that possible threat would not dictate his timing in flexing his powers. He said is main concern \"is getting it right.\"\n\nThe fight over the Keystone XL pipeline that would run from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast also has political implications for the president, not just with Republicans but also his own Democratic Party.\n\nDemocrats see passage of a bill forcing construction of the project as a last-ditch effort to save Sen. Mary Landrieu, who faces a runoff election next month against GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy in oil-producing Louisiana.\n\nThe House passed a measure to move the project forward on Friday, and the Senate is set to act. But Obama has all but threatened a veto, repeatedly saying the only way the pipeline can be approved is after the completion of a long-stalled State Department review.\n\n\"We have to let the process play out,\" he said.\n\nOn Iran, Obama faces a deadline to reach a final agreement in sensitive nuclear negotiations. High-level talks in Oman last week failed to make major headway, potentially setting Obama up for a choice between pursuing another extension or abandoning the diplomatic effort.\n\nThe president has asked the Congress to start debating a new authorization for his airstrike campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, though he expects the legislative effort to pick up next year when Republicans take control of the Senate. The debate comes as Obama faces questions from within his own administration, including from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, about the effectiveness of the military operation, particularly in Syria.\n\nHagel said in a memo to White House national security adviser Susan Rice that Obama needed a clearer strategy for dealing with embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n\nWhite House officials have denied that Obama is undertaking any formal review of his Syria strategy and the president said Sunday that he was not considering ways to oust Assad.\n\nAlso on the agenda: getting the Senate to confirm his nominee for attorney general, federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch. The White House is not pushing for that in the postelection session of Congress, and says the president is leaving the timing up to Senate leadership.\n\nDemocrats are reluctant to push a fight with an empowered GOP over the process and White House officials say they are confident Lynch will be confirmed even with Republicans in control. The GOP takes over in January.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nedra Pickler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Cerca de la mitad es de origen mexicano.\n\nY la mitad vive en Estados Unidos desde hace m\u00e1s de 13 a\u00f1os.\n\nEl n\u00famero de personas \"regularizables\" depender\u00e1 de criterios elegidos por Obama, como por ejemplo, el tiempo de presencia sobre el territorio.\n\nPero, en base a esas informaciones y estimaciones del centro de reflexi\u00f3n Migration Policy Institute, el New York Times estima que hasta 4.1 millones de personas adicionales, adem\u00e1s de esas 1.2 involucradas en el plan de 2012, podr\u00edan recibir los papeles, contabilizando un total cercano a los 5 millones (el 45% de la poblaci\u00f3n sin documentos).\n\n- Las condiciones del plan de 2012 para los j\u00f3venes podr\u00eda extenderse a 1.9 millones de personas, en lugar de 1.2, abriendo ligeramente el abanico sobre los criterios de edad y de llegada sobre el territorio.\n\n- Los padres de ciudadanos estadounidenses, residentes ya regularizados, podr\u00edan tambi\u00e9n verse involucrados: entre 2.5 y 3.4 millones de personas.\n\nLos precedentes: Reagan y Bush\n\nEl fundamento jur\u00eddico del sistema de inmigraci\u00f3n estadounidense data de la Ley sobre la Inmigraci\u00f3n y la Nacionalidad de 1952, adaptada varias veces hasta 1965, cuando los topes actuales de migraci\u00f3n por pa\u00eds fueron creados.\n\nEn 1986, tras cuatro a\u00f1os de batallas parlamentarias, el presidente republicano Ronald Reagan promulg\u00f3 una ley conduciendo a la regularizaci\u00f3n permanente de 2.7 millones de clandestinos.\n\nEs la \u00faltima vez que Estados Unidos procedi\u00f3 a una regularizaci\u00f3n masiva, aunque algunas poblaciones (cubanas, haitianas, estudiantes chinos a principios de los 90...) se hayan beneficiado puntualmente.\n\nLos presidentes Reagan y George H. W. Bush tambi\u00e9n acordaron regularizaciones por decreto con el fin de no separar a los miembros de una familia, pero esos decretos fueron a continuaci\u00f3n aprobados por una ley del Congreso en 1990.\n\nEn este caso, el plan de Obama no tendr\u00eda la fuerza de una ley y podr\u00eda ser anulada por su sucesor en 2017.\n\nTentativas recientes de reforma\n\nEn junio de 2013, el Senado de Estados Unidos adopt\u00f3 una proposici\u00f3n de ley reformando el conjunto del sistema de inmigraci\u00f3n (visados y documentos nacionales para los trabajadores altamente cualificados y estudiantes cient\u00edficos, regularizaci\u00f3n de millones de personas indocumentadas despu\u00e9s de un periodo transitorio de 10 a\u00f1os, refuerzo de los medios en la frontera mexicana...).\n\nPero la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, dominada por los republicanos, no ha examinado nunca la medida en raz\u00f3n de la oposici\u00f3n de una parte de los elegidos conservadores, que la califican de amnist\u00eda.\n\nEn 2006 y 2007, bajo la presidencia de George W. Bush, proyectos de reforma tambi\u00e9n fracasaron en el Congreso a pesar del apoyo del electorado republicano.",

S\u00edguelo en Twitter: @rubennavarrette. Las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son exclusivamente las del autor.\n\n(CNN) - De la misma manera que la miseria, al fracaso le encanta tener compa\u00f1\u00eda. Mira el debate sobre la inmigraci\u00f3n y la manera en que ambos liberales y conservadores (y funcionarios electos de ambos partidos) lo echaron a perder.\n\nEl presidente Barack Obama fracas\u00f3 en el asunto de la pol\u00edtica de inmigraci\u00f3n. Pero ahora que parece estar a punto de tomar acci\u00f3n ejecutiva para arreglar algo de lo que sali\u00f3 mal respecto al sistema de inmigraci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds, los republicanos en el Congreso suenan como si estuvieran a punto de reaccionar de forma exagerada y unirse a \u00e9l en ese fracaso.\n\nA los conservadores les gusta agitar a su reba\u00f1o presentando el relato de que Obama es un firme partidario de la \"amnist\u00eda\" y que el presidente ha ido siempre al mismo paso de los defensores de la reforma de inmigraci\u00f3n.\n\nEso es ficci\u00f3n. Ha sido una relaci\u00f3n inestable. Esto se debe a que Obama pertenece a esa ala del Partido Dem\u00f3crata que no se ha interesado en la legalizaci\u00f3n de los indocumentados y en la creaci\u00f3n de una mayor competencia en el mercado de trabajo para los trabajadores estadounidenses.\n\nObama no cumpli\u00f3 con su promesa de campa\u00f1a de hacer de la reforma uno de los temas m\u00e1s importantes y socav\u00f3 la confianza entre las comunidades de inmigrantes y las fuerzas del orden p\u00fablico al ampliar 100 veces el programa conocido como Comunidades Seguras, el cual persuade a la polic\u00eda local para que haga cumplir la ley federal de inmigraci\u00f3n.\n\nTrat\u00f3 de eludir a los cr\u00edticos que quer\u00edan que frenara las deportaciones afirmando que \u00e9l no ten\u00eda el poder para actuar \"como un rey\". Posteriormente, cambi\u00f3 de opini\u00f3n e hizo justamente eso durante su campa\u00f1a de reelecci\u00f3n del 2012, cuando dio a conocer la Acci\u00f3n Diferida para los Llegadas en la Infancia (DACA, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s).\n\nObama lleg\u00f3 a un r\u00e9cord deportando a 2 millones de personas en cinco a\u00f1os, con lo que dividi\u00f3 a cientos de miles de familias, fracas\u00f3 al encargarse efectivamente de los miles de ni\u00f1os refugiados que atravesaron la frontera Estados Unidos-M\u00e9xico el verano pasado. Luego rompi\u00f3 otra promesa cuando dijo que llevar\u00eda a cabo una acci\u00f3n ejecutiva en cuanto a la inmigraci\u00f3n antes de las elecciones intermedias pero lo pas\u00f3 por alto.\n\nAhora, seg\u00fan informes de prensa que se parecen a un globo de ensayo de la Casa Blanca, podr\u00eda ser que Obama tome medidas unilaterales a principios de esta semana, para ofrecerle a varios millones de inmigrantes ilegales un indulto temporal para evitar la deportaci\u00f3n y quiz\u00e1s incluso darles permisos de trabajo a algunos de ellos.\n\nSi esto se llega a concretar, se demostrar\u00e1 que estoy equivocado. Hace unos meses, dije que esto nunca suceder\u00eda y ahora parece que podr\u00eda suceder.\n\nLas opciones incluyen algunos elementos de sentido com\u00fan: la eliminaci\u00f3n de Comunidades Seguras; la ampliaci\u00f3n del DACA a trav\u00e9s de la eliminaci\u00f3n de las restricciones en cuanto a la manera en que los solicitantes antiguos pueden ser y cu\u00e1ndo tendr\u00edan que haber llegado; la reafirmaci\u00f3n de que la prioridad de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley debe ser erradicar a los criminales violentos y no a las amas de casa y estudiantes, y la ampliaci\u00f3n de los programas de visa para los c\u00f3nyuges inmigrantes de los ciudadanos estadounidenses.\n\nPero es el \u00faltimo punto de la lista el que realmente puede echar a perder los planes: la acci\u00f3n diferida para los padres de los ciudadanos estadounidenses y los residentes legales permanentes, lo cual podr\u00eda resultar en que hasta 4 o 5 millones de personas obtengan el indulto temporal para evitar la deportaci\u00f3n.\n\nCuando los estudiantes universitarios indocumentados que est\u00e1n amparados bajo la Ley Dream empezaron a exigir un trato especial, la exigencia estaba basada en la simple idea de que ellos hab\u00edan sido tra\u00eddos a este pa\u00eds cuando eran ni\u00f1os, y por lo tanto, no decidieron violar la ley de manera deliberada.\n\nEsto es bastante justo. Pero no se puede decir lo mismo de sus padres, quienes intencionalmente incumplieron con la ley. \u00bfY ahora qu\u00e9? \u00bfAcaso existe un nuevo argumento?\n\nAdem\u00e1s, si Obama le ofrece a los padres una acci\u00f3n diferida, esto le dar\u00e1 validez a la situaci\u00f3n en la que los conservadores siempre han insistido: que los hijos de los inmigrantes ilegales en los Estados Unidos pueden ser utilizados para evitar que sus padres sean deportados.\n\nEse nunca ha sido el caso. Los padres son deportados todo el tiempo, y sus hijos, ciudadanos estadounidenses, pueden irse con ellos o bien permanecer en este lado de la frontera y ser colocados bajo cuidado temporal. Los republicanos han estado equivocados todo el tiempo. Ahora, si Obama llega demasiado lejos, podr\u00eda probar que est\u00e1n en lo correcto.\n\nSi el presidente contin\u00faa en el curso de acci\u00f3n propuesto, ambos lados necesitar\u00e1n calmarse.\n\nLos de la izquierda deben abstenerse de celebrar la victoria. Al ponerle fin al monstruo de la deportaci\u00f3n, el presidente simplemente estar\u00eda apagando el fuego que \u00e9l inici\u00f3. Adem\u00e1s, esto es solo un indulto temporal que requerir\u00eda que los indocumentados se entreguen a los agentes del orden p\u00fablico, se les tomen las huellas y todo lo dem\u00e1s. Y todo podr\u00eda ser revocado por el pr\u00f3ximo presidente.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, esto no es lo que Obama prometi\u00f3 hace tiempo cuando trabaj\u00f3 din\u00e1micamente junto con el Congreso para aprobar la legislaci\u00f3n que mejorar\u00eda de forma permanente la vida de millones de personas. Esta no es la reforma. Es una \"reforma superficial\".\n\nSin embargo, al mismo tiempo, los de la derecha tienen que refrenar su desd\u00e9n. En la era posterior al 9/11, los conservadores no deber\u00edan necesitar un recordatorio de algo que nos han estado diciendo durante a\u00f1os: \u00bfqu\u00e9 tan amplia puede ser la envergadura del poder ejecutivo del presidente? Como l\u00edder del poder ejecutivo, Obama tiene naturalmente el poder de establecer las prioridades para la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley de inmigraci\u00f3n.\n\nLos republicanos no tienen problemas para eludir las cr\u00edticas record\u00e1ndoles a los votantes latinos que Obama est\u00e1 a cargo de las deportaciones. As\u00ed que, en lugar de amenazar los berrinches suicidas de una paralizaci\u00f3n o impugnaci\u00f3n del gobierno, los conservadores deber\u00edan callarse la boca y dejar que \u00e9l se haga cargo de las deportaciones. Eso no solo significa decidir qui\u00e9n se va, sino tambi\u00e9n qui\u00e9n se queda.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, a los republicanos les gusta ser implacables cuando hablan acerca la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal y la necesidad de mantener el \"estado de derecho\", pero esa consigna significar\u00eda m\u00e1s viniendo de ellos si dejaran de huir del cumplimiento de esas leyes que tienen como objetivo la ra\u00edz de la inmigraci\u00f3n ilegal: los empleadores estadounidenses que contratan a los indocumentados, muchos de los cuales contribuyen a las campa\u00f1as de reelecci\u00f3n de los legisladores republicanos.\n\nLo que Obama tiene en mente no es un milagro compasivo ni la llegada del apocalipsis. Simplemente se trata de un ejercicio leg\u00edtimo del poder que cualquier presidente tendr\u00eda bajo la Constituci\u00f3n y nuestro sistema de gobierno.\n\nS\u00e9 que no es atractivo, inspirador o incendiario. No contribuir\u00e1 con la recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos de los partidos. Pero tiene la ventaja de que es real.",

Cerca de la mitad es de origen mexicano. Y la mitad vive en Estados Unidos desde hace m\u00e1s de 13 a\u00f1os.\n\nEl n\u00famero de personas \"regularizables\" depender\u00e1 de criterios elegidos por Obama, como por ejemplo, el tiempo de presencia sobre el territorio.

Bush- hicieron lo mismo al extender amnist\u00eda a familiares que no estaban cubiertos bajo la \u00faltima reforma importante a la ley de inmigraci\u00f3n, de 1986.\n\nNo hubo entonces explosiones pol\u00edticas comparables con las que amenazan con provocar ahora los propios republicanos.\n\nBajo la influencia del movimiento ultraderechista Tea Party, el Partido Republicano promete reaccionar en\u00e9rgicamente si y cuando Obama cumple su promesa. El Presidente quiere extender la exenci\u00f3n de deportaci\u00f3n a millones de padres y c\u00f3nyuges de ciudadanos y residentes, as\u00ed como ampliar su programa, en vigor desde hace dos a\u00f1os, que protege a los inmigrantes tra\u00eddos al pa\u00eds cuando eran ni\u00f1os.\n\n\"La temeridad de este presidente que se cree capaz de destruir de un plumazo el imperio de la ley me resulta incomprensible\", dijo el representante Steve King, republicano por Iowa, quien se opone de plano a cualquier flexibilizaci\u00f3n de la ley inmigratoria. \"Es anticonstitucional, es c\u00ednico y es contrario a la voluntad del pueblo estadounidense\".\n\nEstos sentimientos vehementes son comunes entre los legisladores republicanos. Los l\u00edderes del partido advierten que una orden ejecutiva de Obama \"envenenar\u00eda el pozo\" e ir\u00eda en contra de la disposici\u00f3n republicana de colaborar con el presidente durante sus dos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os de mandato.\n\nAlgunos republicanos han mencionado la posibilidad de un juicio pol\u00edtico.\n\nHace casi tres d\u00e9cadas, casi no hubo objeciones cuando Reagan y Bush utilizaron su autoridad para dar amnist\u00eda a c\u00f3nyuges e hijos menores de inmigrantes beneficiados por la ley de 1986.\n\nEse a\u00f1o, el Congreso y Reagan aprobaron una reforma amplia que dio estatus legal a unos tres millones de inmigrantes que carec\u00edan de autorizaci\u00f3n para estar en Estados Unidos si hab\u00edan llegado antes de 1982. Sus c\u00f3nyuges e hijos que hubieran llegado posteriormente no estaban cubiertos por la ley, lo cual provoc\u00f3 protestas de que la norma divid\u00eda a las familias.\n\nLos esfuerzos iniciales en el Congreso para enmendar la ley fracasaron. En 1987, el jefe del Servicio de Inmigraci\u00f3n y Naturalizaci\u00f3n (INS por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) designado por Reagan anunci\u00f3 que los hijos menores de los padres amnistiados por la ley estar\u00edan protegidos de la deportaci\u00f3n.\n\nLos c\u00f3nyuges e hijos de parejas en la que uno de los padres estaba cubierto por la ley pero el otro no pod\u00edan ser deportados, lo cual dio lugar a los intentos de enmendar la ley de 1986.\n\nTal como sucede hoy, en 1989 el Senado aprob\u00f3 una medida para extender el estatus legal a las familias, pero la c\u00e1mara baja no la discuti\u00f3. A trav\u00e9s del INS, Bush propuso una pol\u00edtica de \"justicia familiar\" que pon\u00eda en vigencia la medida del Senado. El Congreso la convirti\u00f3 en ley a fines de ese a\u00f1o como parte de una reforma inmigratoria m\u00e1s amplia.\n\n\"El paralelismo es notable\", dijo Mark Noferi, de la organizaci\u00f3n defensora de inmigrantes American Immigration Council. \"El se\u00f1or Bush fue generoso aquella vez. Protegi\u00f3 al 40 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n no autorizada. En ese entonces eran 1.5 millones. Hoy ser\u00edan cinco millones\".\n\nSin embargo, un abogado que asesor\u00f3 al entonces senador Alan Simpson, republicano por Wyoming, en la elaboraci\u00f3n de la ley de 1986 y el seguimiento de 1990, dijo que la medida de Bush no despert\u00f3 controversia porque los legisladores hab\u00edan dicho claramente que se ocupar\u00edan del asunto.\n\nNo es lo que sucede ahora.\n\n\"Bush padre tom\u00f3 esa medida, pero no es como si el Congreso estuviera legislando en contra\", dijo el abogado Carl Hampe, de la firma especializada en cuestiones inmigratorias Fragomen, Del Rey, Bernsen & Loewy. \"La diferencia ahora es que no hay un camino claro para una disposici\u00f3n legislativa que resuelva la situaci\u00f3n del tipo de beneficiarios a los que apunta la orden del presidente\".\n\nObama podr\u00eda anunciar su medida en pocos d\u00edas y \u00e9sta cubrir\u00eda hasta cinco millones de personas. Se espera que, al igual que Bush, extienda la protecci\u00f3n a familiares de ciudadanos o residentes permanentes.\n\n\"Es evidente que tiene la plena autoridad legar para emitir esas \u00f3rdenes\", dijo el representante dem\u00f3crata tejano Joaqu\u00edn Castro. Los republicanos, a\u00f1adi\u00f3, \"no objetaron en el pasado cuando presidentes republicanos emitieron \u00f3rdenes similares. Esto es puro teatro pol\u00edtico\".\n\nLa medida de Obama no otorgar\u00eda estatus legal a sus beneficiarios, pero los proteger\u00eda temporariamente de la deportaci\u00f3n y les dar\u00eda la posibilidad de obtener un permiso de trabajo.\n\n\"Siempre hay alg\u00fan precedente para la discrecionalidad fiscal\", dijo el representante republicano Trent Franks, de Arizona. \"Pero lo que este presidente llama discrecionalidad fiscal equivale a hacer pedazos la Constituci\u00f3n en la Casa Blanca\".\n\nEl presidente republicano de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, John Boehner, no ha llegado al punto de amenazar con el uso del poder presupuestario del Congreso para frustrar una medida ejecutiva de Obama. Su prioridad es evitar un cierre del gobierno, pero ha dicho claramente que si Obama cumple con su amenaza, los republicanos le cobrar\u00e1n un alto precio.\n\n\"Todo gobierno necesita esto y aquello, necesita toda clase de cosas\", dijo Boehner el jueves. \"Si \u00e9l quiere actuar por su cuenta, hay cosas que no va a conseguir\".",

Denuncian que riqueza del G-20 se concentra en pocas manos. De acuerdo con Sharan Burrow, secretaria general de la Confederaci\u00f3n Sindical Internacional, los gobiernos dan prioridad a pol\u00edticas que sustentan los intereses de las grandes empresas y no a las destinadas a paliar la desigualdad salarial y el aumento del desempleo.\n\nPor eso, en un encuentro previo a la cumbre del G-20 que se celebrar\u00e1 este fin de semana en la ciudad australiana de Barisbane, las organizaciones gremiales presentaron un paquete de propuestas sobre el tema.\n\nEn la cita, los pa\u00edses participantes pretenden ratificar su meta de lograr un crecimiento cercano a dos por ciento del Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) en los pr\u00f3ximos cinco a\u00f1os. Pero los sindicatos consideraron que, de llevarse a cabo sus recomendaciones, las econom\u00edas m\u00e1s desarrolladas podr\u00edan expandirse 5.84 por ciento y, a la vez, crear\u00edan 33 millones de empleos. Entre las medidas propuestas por el A20 se incluye que cada pa\u00eds invierta uno por ciento de su PIB en infraestructuras, en especial las que permitan la transmisi\u00f3n a una econom\u00eda baja en emisiones de carbono. Al mismo tiempo, el grupo pidi\u00f3 un salario m\u00ednimo en todos los pa\u00edses del G-20, niveles adecuados de seguridad en el puesto de trabajo y protecci\u00f3n social, adem\u00e1s de normas que posibiliten la inserci\u00f3n laboral de mujeres y j\u00f3venes sin experiencia.\n\nOtras sugerencias persiguen que los acuerdos comerciales y la cooperaci\u00f3n a desarrollo concuerden con los est\u00e1ndares laborales internacionales, y que se adopten estrategias para una acci\u00f3n contra el cambio clim\u00e1tico y un crecimiento verde.\n\nComo era f\u00e1cil de anticipar hace apenas breves d\u00edas de la derrota del Partido Dem\u00f3crata del presidente norteamericano Barack Obama, derrota que se trata m\u00e1s como personal de don Barack que de un partido sobre otro, es decir la derrota la atribuyen los triunfadores a los \"errores presidenciales\" que no son otra cosa que el esfuerzo que hizo el presidente en el llamado Obamacare que dio oportunidad de tener Seguro Social a millones de la clase media y al intento, que a\u00fan pervive, de impulsar las Reformas Migratorias, esos son los grandes sellos que Obama ha querido poner a su gesti\u00f3n en la Casa Blanca.\n\nLos Republicanos, que ahora controlan ambas C\u00e1maras del Congreso, ya anunciaron que no le permitir\u00e1n al presidente llevar a cabo sus grandes reformas, adem\u00e1s de otras medidas como de la creaci\u00f3n de un gran oleoducto que ir\u00eda de los campos petroleros de Alaska hasta las refiner\u00edas de Houston, lo que convertir\u00eda a Estados Unidos en exportador de hidrocarburos en vez de importador, lo cual desde luego nos afectar\u00eda, porque no hemos abierto nuevos mercados para nuestro petr\u00f3leo que ha sostenido por a\u00f1os nuestra econom\u00eda.\n\nEn cuanto a los millones de paisanos que han esperado regularizar su estancia en el pa\u00eds del norte, parece que por fin se lograr\u00e1 este sue\u00f1o. En efecto, una medida del presidente Barack Obama para evitar la deportaci\u00f3n de unas cinco millones de personas, que se anunciar\u00e1 la pr\u00f3xima semana, se perfila como el primer gran enfrentamiento entre el jefe de la Casa Blanca y el nuevo liderazgo republicano en el Congreso, que tiene una reci\u00e9n electa mayoritaria en el Senado.\n\nEl pr\u00f3ximo l\u00edder de la mayor\u00eda republicana en la C\u00e1mara alta, Mitch McConnel, nombrado este viernes para ese cargo, advirti\u00f3 que si Obama emite \u00f3rdenes ejecutivas ante la crisis migratoria del pa\u00eds \"cometer\u00e1 un grave error\". A su vez, el presidente de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, el republicano John Boehner, afirm\u00f3 que su partido estudia levantar una demanda federal contra las \u00f3rdenes ejecutivas del presidente.\n\nBoehner mencion\u00f3 esta posibilidad en junio pasado, cuando afirm\u00f3 que las \u00f3rdenes ejecutivas del mandatario son anticonstitucionales, pues anulan una parte del gobierno. Obama alista la presentaci\u00f3n de una serie de decretos como Poder Ejecutivo que impedir\u00edan la deportaci\u00f3n de cerca de cinco millones de indocumentados. Las medidas incluyen extender protecciones contra la deportaci\u00f3n a padres y c\u00f3nyuges de ciudadanos estadounidenses y residentes permanentes que han estado en el pa\u00eds algunos a\u00f1os. Tambi\u00e9n se ampliar\u00e1 el programa de amnist\u00eda creado hace dos a\u00f1os que impide temporalmente la deportaci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes.\n\nLos republicanos en el Congreso se oponen a dichas medidas. Mientras, los legisladores regresaban al Capitolio esta semana despu\u00e9s de las elecciones intermedias en las que el Partido Republicano retom\u00f3 el control del Senado. Algunos l\u00edderes republicanos advirtieron que el resultado de esta presi\u00f3n podr\u00eda llevar a otra paralizaci\u00f3n de actividades gubernamentales no vitales, como la vivida el a\u00f1o pasado por diferencias sobre la reforma de salud impulsada por Obama. Aunque el mandatario no tiene autoridad para otorgar ciudadan\u00eda o tarjeta de residencia permanente sin la aprobaci\u00f3n del Congreso, puede dar protecci\u00f3n temporal contra la deportaci\u00f3n y conceder permisos de trabajo. Medios estadounidenses, incluido los diarios The New York Times y The Washington Post reportaron que el mandatario anunciar\u00e1 las medidas ejecutivas la pr\u00f3xima semana, aunque no hay a\u00fan ning\u00fan anuncio oficial al respecto.\n\nTambi\u00e9n se esperan ajustes en el programa de suspensi\u00f3n de deportaci\u00f3n que conceden residencia y permiso de trabajo a inmigrantes de menos de 31 a\u00f1os que llegaron al pa\u00eds antes de junio de 2007.\n\nM\u00e1s de 600 mil inmigrantes j\u00f3venes est\u00e1n al amparo de dicho programa. Eliminar el l\u00edmite de edad de los solicitantes -opci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 en consideraci\u00f3n- har\u00eda que otras 200 mil personas puedan beneficiarse de la medida.\n\nSIN SEGURO LOS DEL COMERCIO INFORMAL Y MUCHOS DEL FORMAL\n\nM\u00e1s de 29 millones de mexicanos est\u00e1n fuera de la seguridad social; tienen empleo, pero en la informalidad, se inform\u00f3 en el Encuentro de Mujeres del Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores del Issste y la Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Organizaciones Populares, cuya secretaria general, Cristiana D\u00edaz Salazar, indic\u00f3 que M\u00e9xico tiene que crecer econ\u00f3micamente para generar empleos e integrar aquellos que est\u00e1n en la inconformidad a la seguridad social. Luis Miguel Victoria Ranfla, dirigente del Sntissste, dijo que se requiere que los sectores tomen acciones en com\u00fan con metas que beneficien a todo el pa\u00eds.",

Millones de inmigrantes indocumentados podr\u00edan beneficiarse de la acci\u00f3n ejecutiva del presidente quien, seg\u00fan destaca el abogado Rafael Lanzo-Guilbe, est\u00e1 limitado constitucionalmente en esta materia. \"Es importante se\u00f1alar que tanto la residencia permanente como la ciudadan\u00eda son asuntos enteramente del Congreso; el presidente podr\u00eda atender solamente aquello relacionado con las deportaciones\", explic\u00f3 Lanzo-Guilbe.\n\nLa semana pasada el peri\u00f3dico The New York Times, citando como fuente de su informaci\u00f3n a funcionarios an\u00f3nimos del Gobierno, anunciaba que tantos como cinco millones de personas evitar\u00edan la deportaci\u00f3n por las \u00f3rdenes ejecutivas de Obama. Una cifra que este experto de inmigraci\u00f3n pone en cuesti\u00f3n. \"El n\u00famero podr\u00eda ser mayor o menor. Todo depende de los requisitos que el presidente establezca en su orden ejecutiva para evitar las deportaciones\", expres\u00f3.\n\nSobre estos requisitos, Lanzo-Guilbe considera probable que incluyan:\n\n-Una determinada edad de llegada al pa\u00eds.\n\n-Estar al d\u00eda en la declaraci\u00f3n de impuestos.\n\n-No tener antecedentes penales.\n\n-El pago de una cuota de tramitaci\u00f3n.\n\nDebido a la complejidad en los requisitos de la acci\u00f3n ejecutiva, el experto aconseja acudir a los servicios legales de abogados admitidos a la pr\u00e1ctica en los Estados Unidos y preferiblemente, que se dediquen a atender casos de inmigraci\u00f3n.
