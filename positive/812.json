                    "body": "NEW DELHI -- India celebrated putting a spacecraft into orbit around Mars on Wednesday, hoping the rare feat will show the world it is open for business in space exploration and inspire a new generation of homegrown scientists to help drive growth.\n\nThose motivations help explain why India, a poor country of 1.2 billion, even invests in a space program when so many of its people lack access to proper toilets, electricity and health care.\n\nFor one, boosting its space business has always been a key selling point of the country's program.\n\nMore than half of the world's missions to Mars so far have failed. In proving it can pull off a complex space mission, India becomes one of the world's few reliable ferrymen to the stars. That can attract investors, commercial launch orders and customers to hire Indian rockets and satellites for their scientific research.\n\nBut the program also is a source of pride and motivation for the country's burgeoning ranks of young professionals. India's robust scientific and technical education system has already produced millions of software programmers, engineers and doctors who have helped grow the country's growing middle class.\n\n\"Mars, of course, captures the imagination of the world. What better goal is there to reach for, to prove we can accomplish our goals?\" said B.N. Raghunandan, the engineering dean at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India's tech hub.\n\nEvery time India launches another rocket, he said he is bombarded by students asking how they can get into the school's aerospace engineering program.\n\nIndia's credibility also gets a huge boost, he said. \"These kinds of successes put India in a better bargaining position, reassuring investors that we can perform.\"\n\nIndia joined an elite club when it successfully guided its Mars Orbiter Mission, affectionately called MOM, into orbit around the red planet Wednesday morning. Only the U.S., former Soviet Union and European Space Agency have been able to do that before.\n\nIn scenes broadcast live on TV, scientists at the Indian Space and Research Organisation's command center in Bangalore erupted into cheers as orbiter's engines completed 24 minutes of burn time to maneuver the spacecraft into place. MOM had traveled some 666 million kilometers (414 million miles) and more than 300 days since breaking from Earth's gravitational pull.\n\n\"Our scientists have achieved this in the first attempt,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said from the command center. \"We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved near impossible.\"\n\nIndia was particularly proud that MOM was developed with homegrown technology and for a bargain price of about $75 million - a cost that Modi quipped was lower than many Hollywood movie budgets. NASA's much larger Maven mission, whose satellite went into orbit around Mars on Sunday, cost nearly 10 times as much, at $671 million.\n\nThe country's business sector applauded the mission, with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry saying \"it will encourage Indian industry to invest in the research and innovation.\"\n\nIndia's success shows the world that \"they are now a force of capability ... that can be taken very seriously,\" said space expert Roger Franzen, the technical program manager at the Australian National University's Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\n\"India has an extremely well-developed space industry that manufactures everything from the components to the spacecraft to the instrumentation to the launch vessels,\" he said.\n\nIn the realm of scientific space research, India also could soon join in collaborative missions with NASA or ESA, he suggested.\n\nIndia has already conducted dozens of successful satellite launches, including sending up the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter, which discovered key evidence of water on the moon in 2008. And it plans new scientific missions, including putting a rover on the moon.\n\nBut the focus for the space agency, which operates on an annual budget of $1.1 billion, will remain on developing technologies for commercial and navigational satellite applications, the agency's chief K. Radhakrishnan said Tuesday. Those services could bring in significant revenues from companies or governments seeking to place their own satellites or research equipment in space.\n\n\"If we're going to earn money, we're going to do it on that,\" said D. Raghunandan of the Delhi Science Forum, a group that promotes the study of science. \"India's portfolio is likely to be somewhat limited because we can't afford to spend that much money in pure science exploration and in an exercise of the imagination.\"\n\nStill, India hopes to gather scientific data to deepen our understanding of Mars and the wider universe.\n\nMOM will circle the planet for at least six months, with solar-powered instruments gathering scientific data that may shed light on Martian weather systems as well as what happened to the water that is believed to have existed once on Mars.\n\nIt also will search Mars for methane, a key chemical in life processes on Earth that could also come from geological processes. Experts hope data gathered will help them better understand how planets form and what conditions might make life possible.\n\n\"Mars is gradually unveiling its secrets to science and humanity and the Indian mission is yet another means of unveiling this enigma that Mars presents,\" said Franzen.\n\nEven though India wrestles with many problems from poverty to hunger, that shouldn't stop the country from forging ahead in science and space, said B.N. Raghunandan, of the Indian Institute of Science.\n\n\"I don't think we can afford to lag behind. We can't sacrifice frontier research for the sake of solving old-world problems,\" he said. \"These technological advances have their own spinoffs and benefits.\"\n\nFor 12-year-old Mansha Khanna, who was visiting the Nehru Planetarium in New Delhi for Mars-themed learning activities and games, the mission's success gave her something to dream about - becoming \"a scientist or an astronaut.\"\n\nFor another student, Kashish, also 12, who uses only one name, the sky was the limit.\n\n\"I am proud to be born in a country that can do anything and succeed,\" he said.",

In proving it can pull off a complex space mission, India becomes one of the world's few reliable ferrymen to the stars.

What better goal is there to reach for, to prove we can accomplish our goals?\" said B.N. Raghunandan, the engineering dean at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India's tech hub.\n\nEvery time India launches another rocket, he said he is bombarded by students asking how they can get into the school's aerospace engineering program.\n\nIndia's credibility also gets a huge boost, he said. \"These kinds of successes put India in a better bargaining position, reassuring investors that we can perform.\"\n\nIndia joined an elite club when it successfully guided its Mars Orbiter Mission, affectionately called MOM, into orbit around the red planet Wednesday morning. Only the U.S., former Soviet Union and European Space Agency have been able to do that before.\n\nIn scenes broadcast live on TV, scientists at the Indian Space and Research Organisation's command center in Bangalore erupted into cheers as orbiter's engines completed 24 minutes of burn time to maneuver the spacecraft into place. MOM had traveled some 666 million kilometers (414 million miles) and more than 300 days since breaking from Earth's gravitational pull.\n\n\"Our scientists have achieved this in the first attempt,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said from the command center. \"We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved near impossible.\"\n\nIndia was particularly proud that MOM was developed with homegrown technology and for a bargain price of about $75 million - a cost that Modi quipped was lower than many Hollywood movie budgets. NASA's much larger Maven mission, whose satellite went into orbit around Mars on Sunday, cost nearly 10 times as much, at $671 million.\n\nThe country's business sector applauded the mission, with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry saying \"it will encourage Indian industry to invest in the research and innovation.\"\n\nIndia's success shows the world that \"they are now a force of capability ... that can be taken very seriously,\" said space expert Roger Franzen, the technical program manager at the Australian National University's Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\n\"India has an extremely well-developed space industry that manufactures everything from the components to the spacecraft to the instrumentation to the launch vessels,\" he said.\n\nIn the realm of scientific space research, India also could soon join in collaborative missions with NASA or ESA, he suggested.\n\nIndia has already conducted dozens of successful satellite launches, including sending up the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter, which discovered key evidence of water on the moon in 2008. And it plans new scientific missions, including putting a rover on the moon.\n\nBut the focus for the space agency, which operates on an annual budget of $1.1 billion, will remain on developing technologies for commercial and navigational satellite applications, the agency's chief K.

Experts hope data gathered will help them better understand how planets form and what conditions might make life possible.\n\n\"Mars is gradually unveiling its secrets to science and humanity and the Indian mission is yet another means of unveiling this enigma that Mars presents,\" said Franzen.\n\nEven though India wrestles with many problems from poverty to hunger, that shouldn't stop the country from forging ahead in science and space, said B.N. Raghunandan, of the Indian Institute of Science.\n\n\"I don't think we can afford to lag behind. We can't sacrifice frontier research for the sake of solving old-world problems,\" he said. \"These technological advances have their own spinoffs and benefits.\"\n\nFor 12-year-old Mansha Khanna, who was visiting the Nehru Planetarium in New Delhi for Mars-themed learning activities and games, the mission's success gave her something to dream about - becoming \"a scientist or an astronaut.\"\n\nFor another student, Kashish, also 12, who uses only one name, the sky was the limit.\n\n\"I am proud to be born in a country that can do anything and succeed,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Nirmala George in New Delhi and Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report.\n\nIndian Space and Research Organization: www.isro.org/\n\n___\n\nFollow Katy Daigle on Twitter at twitter.com/katydaigle",

Radhakrishnan, the agency's chief. \"Those services could bring in significant revenues from companies or governments seeking to place their own satellites or research equipment in space.\"",

They spent less than the United States and other countries.\"\n\nDarar during a Wednesday phone interview was well aware of the news that his native country managed to launch a spacecraft into orbit around Mars the same day for $75 million, which is less than the $671 million spent by NASA on a much larger Maven mission for a satellite that went into obit around the same planet Sunday.\n\nIndia hoped the rare feat will would show the world it is open for business in space exploration and inspire a new generation of homegrown scientists to help drive growth, the Associated Press reported from New Delhi. Those motivations help explain why India, a country of 1.2 billion, even invests in a space program.\n\nAfter growing up in India, Darar moved to the United States in 1981 and became a U.S. citizen.\n\nHe hopes his former and current countries will cooperate on space exploration and other endeavors.\n\n\"These are the two largest democratic countries in the world,\" Darar said. \"If they work together, it is good for everybody in the world. We have to work for all of the amenities.\"\n\nHe noted that both countries also face threats.\n\n\"We have to fight against them or work together for peace,\" Darar said. \"We have to unite together.\"\n\nLike Darar, Ron Ferrara, Middle Tennessee State University Aerospace Department chairman, sees what India did as a great accomplishment.\n\n\"I found it interesting that they succeeded on their first try, which is unusual,\" Ferrara said during a Wednesday phone interview. \"I think another interesting fact is that it cost less than it cost to make the movie \"Gravity.\" They are fairly advanced in technology in India, and they have a strong satellite program for commercial and navigation satellites.\"\n\nFerrara also noted how India is the first Asian country to succeed with having a spacecraft orbit Mars.\n\n\"It probably doesn't make their neighbors happy,\" Ferrara said. \"I don't know if it means too much to our students except that other countries are advancing rapidly in the field of aviation. We do have some students from India in our program. I'm sure they are excited about it. India is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world. That whole part of the world is advancing rapidly.\"\n\nThe university, for example, has aviation graduates flying for an airline serving customers in Vietnam, he said.\n\nMTSU President Sidney McPhee is interested in recruiting students from that part of the world, Ferrara added.\n\n\"He's been very successful recruiting in China,\" Ferrara said. \"We have a number of partnership with universities in China. We recruit heavily from that part of the world.\"\n\nFerrara also expects to see aviation grow as an industry here.\n\n\"It's a pretty good market right now,\" he said. \"I think there's an opportunity to develop a research and operation center in this part of the state.\"\n\nWhen it comes to India, boosting space business has always been a key selling point of the country's program, the AP article reported.\n\nMore than half of the world's missions to Mars so far have failed. In proving it can pull off a complex space mission, India becomes one of the world's few reliable ferrymen to the stars. That can attract investors, commercial launch orders and customers to hire Indian rockets and satellites for their scientific research.\n\nBut the program also is a source of pride and motivation for the country's burgeoning ranks of young professionals. India's robust scientific and technical education system has already produced millions of software programmers, engineers and doctors who have helped grow the country's growing middle class.\n\n\"Mars, of course, captures the imagination of the world. What better goal is there to reach for, to prove we can accomplish our goals?\" said B.N. Raghunandan, the engineering dean at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India's tech hub.\n\nEvery time India launches another rocket, he said he is bombarded by students asking how they can get into the school's aerospace engineering program.\n\nIndia's credibility also gets a huge boost, he said. \"These kinds of successes put India in a better bargaining position, reassuring investors that we can perform.\"\n\nIndia joined an elite club when it successfully guided its Mars Orbiter Mission, affectionately called MOM, into orbit around the red planet Wednesday morning. Only the U.S., former Soviet Union and European Space Agency have been able to do that before.\n\nIn scenes broadcast live on TV, scientists at the Indian Space and Research Organization's command center in Bangalore erupted into cheers as orbiter's engines completed 24 minutes of burn time to maneuver the spacecraft into place. MOM had traveled some 666 million kilometers (414 million miles) and more than 300 days since breaking from Earth's gravitational pull.\n\n\"Our scientists have achieved this in the first attempt,\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said from the command center. \"We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved near impossible.\"\n\nContact Scott Broden at 615-278-5158 or sbroden@dnj.com.

                    "body": "Every Indians must be relishing extraordinary feat after Mangalyaan was successfully sent into Martian orbit on Wednesday. But amidst this great moment, there are some critics who are having this cynical attitude towards this Indian space Mission.\n\nThese so called intelligent people believe that the rather splurging money on these mission that could be used in providing basic amenities to millions of poor and deprived people of the country.\n\nThough some of these inane arguments were made before this spectacular success of 'MOM' mission, but now after this historic moment they will definitely have to eat their own words.\n\nIllogical argument that if no toilets, electricity then why this big spending\n\nShowing apprehension over success of the mission, former ISRO chief G Madhavan Nair last year had said, \"ISRO is embarking on an extravagant mission which at best can serve as a publicity stunt\". Earlier while speaking to Science magazine in 2012, the man behind Chandrayaan-I mission opined , \"it's a half-baked, half-cooked mission being attempted in undue haste with misplaced objectives.\"\n\nSimilarly D Raghunandan who is a secretary of the the Delhi Science Forum had raised suspicion over the one of the frugal Indian space Mission. As quoted by first post he termed 'MOM' \"a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives.\n\nThen other ludicrous arguments are doing the rounds that in India where millions barely afford two times of meal in a day, basic amenities of life i.e clean water, electricity and health care are beyond their reach, this splurging money on space Mission is not logical one.\n\nDid they mean that we should have wait till India gets free of these maladies and achieve 100 per cent result in these areas.\n\nSo then why this big spending on defence projects, where every year thousands crores rupees are being allocated in Budget. This is really a silly argument. It is matter of concern that in our country 300 million people are still living on less than $1.25 a day , but that doesn't mean we will not spend money on nuclear missiles or so matter other defence projects to make safe and secure nation.\n\nIn seventies, US, Russia were battling with swathes of problems like civil strife then Vietnam wars but in spite of that they not only took the plunge but got thumping success on this space Mission.\n\nHow space mission is useful\n\nISRO has been facing such criticism since its inception days where people keep on raising questions about its beneficial application to the common Indian citizen. Though its website clearly states it's motto \"Space technology in the service of human kind\", but they hardly assuage these group of people.\n\nIt is now established fact that satellites help people like farmers, fisherman, and other agricultural professionals by giving weather predictions. Not only that they even predicts weather condition which proves useful at time to prevent big natural calamities. Experts believe that though 'MOM' success doesn't have practical importance but it will give big push to science and technology.\n\nEven Dr. Radhakrishnan in January 2014 interview had accepted this fact. He said that this ( Mars Mission) will not not having direct benefits to the common Indian person, but it is an investment in the economic growth of the country that will benefit all of its citizens in the long run.\n\nThis will give credibility boost and put India in better bargaining position now\n\nDespite India has spent only about $74 million, a fraction of US ( $671 million) and other countries Russia, the European Space Agency and Japan who spend more than $100 million, the move is being questioned.\n\nIt is being said that Rocket launching is a multi-billion dollar industry in the world which is growing at an exponential rate every year. Experts believe that the MOM mission will heighten ISRO's credibility and marketability before the international community. As quoted by ABC news \"These kinds of successes put India in a better bargaining position, reassuring investors that we can perform\", B.N. Raghunandan, dean at the IISc said as quoted by ABC news.\n\nAccepting the fact that terrestrial problems are mounting in India, but this is the need of hour, another expert at IISc said \"I don't think we can afford to lag behind. We can't sacrifice frontier research for the sake of solving old-world problems,\" he said. \"These technological advances have their own spinoffs and benefits\".\n\nMayank N Vahia, a scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research said, \"ISRO will now hopefully attract a lot of business. We will now attract more international attention and international trade for satellites.\"\n\nScience stream including Atomic Energy, DRDO will attract young minds now\n\nIn one of the interview, the ISRO director Dr. Radhakrishnan had said, \"People are keeping awake at night to see how the Mars orbiter operations are progressing. So if you can transform so many young minds...to take up a career in science, it is a big transformation for the country, for the future.\"\n\nHe is very right and that i can say with full confidence after watching the great moment of MOM success on news channel. The amount of euphoria, excitements this whole of the 'MOM' mission generated amongst youth, that in itself is big proof. Currently, many of the youths are veering away from science field to corporate filed because of big money and lucrative career. Why the science stream not attractive them anymore?\n\nAccording to a Rediff report, for decades India was the Third World's unquestioned 'science superpower' for decades. In 1980, India with 15,000 science journals was way ahead against China(1,000 papers).\n\nBut India could not maintained its glorious past and in these years, China moved up in the ranking leaving behind India. Even other countries like Brazil, Taiwan and South Korea are giving tough competition. Hopefully, with this giant leap, Indian youth will again prefer science as their favorite subject.\n\nIndia's space prowess matter of envy for other countries specially China\n\nRecently, Jean Dreze, a leading developmental economist and professor at the Delhi University, has criticized the whole mission saying it is another assertion of power by India to gain status of \"superpower\".\n\nThough no Indian leader will explicitly accept this fact but it is true. This is because India has come a long way since 1960s when this whole space Mission was started. Western countries had imposed sanctions for a nuclear weapons test in 1974, in spite of that India developed its own rocket technology. So with this 'MOM' success India has got reason to sound haughty.\n\nAfter achieving this milestone, India has placed itself in elite club of Martian explorers with United States, European Space Agency and former Soviet Union. Even big Asian giants China and Japan has not been lucky till now. This success has surely given a boost to India's global standing in space research.\n\nBefore this milestone, China had envious record on the front. As quoted by TOI \"China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far, it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India\".\n\nThough, India has proved its mettle, but surely it has long way to go. According to Colorado-based Space Foundation India still a small player in the global space industry that grew to $314 billion in 2013.",
