But other sites at Cattenom (Moselle), Blayais (Gironde) were also affected and four - Bugey (Ain) in the east, Chooz (Ardennes) and Gravelines (Nord) in the north and Nogent-sur-Seine (Aube) east of Paris - were targeted on one day, October 19.\n\nEDF said that no one had so far admitted responsibility for the drone flights.\n\nAnti-nuclear group Greenpeace, which used a drone to film one of its activists flying a paraglider into the Bugey plant in May 2012, has denied all involvement, saying it always carried out its protests against France's 58 nuclear reactors in the open.\n\nSpokesman Yannick Rousselet said flying drones over four sites on the one day was a major operation and it was \"very worried\" about the implications and the fact that EDF and police had given no indication of who was behind the flights.\n\nHe added that other sources had told them that other sites had also been overflown by drones but without the information being released by EDF. He said they were the Superph\u00e9nix plant in Is\u00e8re, the Atomic Energy Commision site at Saclay in Essonne, the Pierrelatte power station in Dr\u00f4me and the Fessenheim site, which contains France's oldest nuclear reactor.\n\nBugey nuclear power station - Photo: EDF-COLIN Matthieu",

Una de las plantas est\u00e1 actualmente fuera de servicio.\n\nEl grupo ecologista Greenpeace afirm\u00f3 que \"al menos diez\" instalaciones nucleares en todo el pa\u00eds hab\u00edan sido blanco de los aviones no tripulados, incluida la planta nuclear m\u00e1s antigua del pa\u00eds en Fessenheim, en la frontera con Alemania, y contigua a la sede administrativa de la Comisi\u00f3n de Energ\u00eda At\u00f3mica, cerca de Par\u00eds.\n\nLa EDF neg\u00f3 cualquier avistamiento de aviones no tripulados sobre esa planta nuclear. \"No se sobrevol\u00f3 Fessenheim\", dijo a dpa un portavoz de la empresa estatal.\n\nSi bien no hay indicios de qui\u00e9n est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s de los vuelos no tripulados, las sospechas recayeron inmediatamente en el lobby antinuclear, que ya anteriormente realiz\u00f3 diversas acciones para destacar el tema de la seguridad nuclear.\n\nGreenpeace, que en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os realiz\u00f3 varias eventos en las plantas nucleares para aumentar la conciencia de la seguridad at\u00f3mica, neg\u00f3 cualquier participaci\u00f3n en estos hechos, que calific\u00f3 a su vez de \"muy preocupante\".\n\n\"En todas sus acciones, Greenpeace act\u00faa abiertamente y asume la responsabilidad\", dijo el grupo ecologista, que reclam\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n sobre la seguridad del espacio a\u00e9reo alrededor de las plantas nucleares.\n\nFED dijo que despu\u00e9s de cada uno de estos incidentes notific\u00f3 a las autoridades y present\u00f3 una denuncia penal contra personas desconocidas por ingresar de manera ilegal en el espacio a\u00e9reo sobre una instalaci\u00f3n nuclear.\n\nLas aeronaves tienen prohibido volar en un radio de cinco kil\u00f3metros y a 1.000 metros de altura sobre una planta nuclear.\n\nPor su parte, el ministro del Interior de Francia, Bernard Cazeneuve, dijo a la radio France Info, que se estaban tomando medidas para \"neutralizar estos aviones no tripulados\", aunque no hizo menci\u00f3n sobre qui\u00e9nes pod\u00edan estar detr\u00e1s de los vuelos y apunt\u00f3 que las investigaciones est\u00e1n en curso.\n\nLa FED, en tanto, minimiz\u00f3 la importancia de los vuelos alegando que no ten\u00edan \"ning\u00fan impacto en el seguro funcionamiento de las plantas\".

Van a reemplazar por ejemplo a las c\u00e1maras de seguridad o al polic\u00eda t\u00edpico de la esquina del barrio\".\n\n\"Para mi era interesante intentar mostrar c\u00f3mo estas tecnolog\u00edas incipientes van a convivir con nosotros pero sin modificar o cambiar enormemente el dise\u00f1o de las ciudades\", le dijo a la BBC Fernando Barbella.\n\n\"Siempre hay un precio que pagar: \u00bfCu\u00e1nta informaci\u00f3n queremos compartir con todos estos dispositivos?\", se pregunt\u00f3 el dise\u00f1ador.\n\n\"Para mi es interesante pensar en estos sentimientos encontrados sobre las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas: s\u00ed, vamos a acogerlas pero a la vez, pens\u00e1ndolo bien... \u00bfcu\u00e1nta tecnolog\u00eda realmente queremos poner en nuestras vidas?\".",
