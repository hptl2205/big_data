The line-up is usually announced the month before the festival opens.\n\nIf the Coen brothers' filmography is anything to by, though, dark humour and offbeat characters or situations would be appealing traits they would be looking for.\n\nThey have also increasingly been attracting Hollywood stars to their own films.\n\nGeorge Clooney, for instance, has already appeared in three of their movies -- \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", \"Intolerable Cruelty\" and \"Burn After Reading\".

Cannes is a festival that has been important to us since the very beginning of our career. Presiding over the Jury is a special honour, since we have never heretofore been president of anything. We will issue further proclamations at the appropriate time.\"",

                    "body": "Los Angeles (AFP) - Regarded as two of the most innovative directors in the world, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have been pushing back the boundaries of movie-making for nearly three decades.\n\nThe nearly inseparable American duo, who will chair the Cannes film festival jury in May, write, direct and produce their films jointly. They have also edited movies, under the alias Roderick Jaynes.\n\nThey know Cannes well, having won the Palme d'Or in 1991 for \"Barton Fink,\" and the best director prize for \"Fargo\" in 1996 and \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" in 2001. Their \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" won them the jury's grand prize in 2013.\n\nSince exploding onto the scene in 1984 with their offbeat thriller \"Blood Simple,\" the two have reeled off a dozen films, each notable for their distinctive quirky humor or macabre themes.\n\nFavored by critics and film festivals, they have won more than 100 prizes together. They have been jointly nominated for 12 Academy Awards and one individual Oscar each.\n\nThe siblings are known as the \"two-headed director\" within the movie world for their seamless ability to work alongside each other.\n\nJoel, 60, and Ethan, 57, grew up in St Louis Park, Minnesota as the children of college professors. They had an interest in film from an early age, remaking movies seen on television with a Super-8 camera they bought using money saved from mowing lawns.\n\nAfter graduating from Simon's Rock College of Bard in Massachusetts, Joel spent four years studying film at New York University, while Ethan attended Princeton, where he graduated in philosophy in 1979.\n\nJoel's early experience involved working as an assistant editor on Sam Raimi's 1981 film \"The Evil Dead\" and it was another three years before the two brothers arrived with \"Blood Simple,\" which they wrote and directed.\n\nThe film is notable for the appearance of Frances McDormand, who would later marry Joel before appearing in several of the brothers' films.\n\nThe Coens followed up with their screwball 1987 comedy \"Raising Arizona\" starring Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter as a married couple who steal a baby to raise as their own.\n\nThe start of the next decade saw the Coens pay homage to gangster films with the 1990 flick \"Miller's Crossing,\" featuring a youthful Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney and John Turturro.\n\nTwo memorable comedies -- \"Barton Fink\" (1991) and \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" (1994) -- came next, before arguably the Coens' best-known film, \"Fargo,\" in 1996.\n\nThe movie, about a bungling car salesman (William Macy) who sets up a bogus kidnap plot involving his wife with disastrous consequences, earned two Oscars: best actress for McDormand and original screenplay for the Coens.\n\nIt has since been made into a television series that began in 2014, with the Coen brothers serving as executive producers.\n\nA dramatic change of tone was to follow with 1998's \"The Big Lebowski,\" a surreal comedy about an aging Californian slacker (Jeff Bridges) who is mistaken for a millionaire, and hilarity ensues.\n\nAnother comedy, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" starring George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as three convicts on the run in 1930s Mississippi came in 2000. The film, a loose interpretation of Homer's \"The Odyssey,\" was nominated for two Oscars.\n\nThe Coens returned to neo-noir in their next film, \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" (2001), while a second collaboration with Clooney came in the 2003 offbeat comedy \"Intolerable Cruelty.\"\n\nA remake of the classic comedy \"The Ladykillers,\" starring Tom Hanks, came in 2004 before the bleak \"No Country for Old Men,\" which won four Oscars in 2008 -- best director, best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Javier Bardem.\n\nLater that year, they teamed up with Clooney and McDormand again in \"Burn After Reading,\" a comedy about a hapless pair of gym employees trying to make money from a disc containing the memoirs of a CIA agent.\n\nIn 2009 came \"A Serious Man,\" a typically black comedy about a Midwest professor who watches his life unravel through a series of incidents, seemingly unable to stop the downward spiral.\n\n\"True Grit,\" (2010) a remake of the classic John Wayne western, took the Coens into unexplored territory.\n\nThe mostly urban, New York-based pair had never worked with animals, for example, let alone horses thundering across plains in bloody shootouts.\n\nBut some of their trademark touches are there to see -- unexpected graphic violence, odd verbal mannerisms -- if not as obvious as in many of their award-winning films.\n\nThey followed up with \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" a nostalgic film full of humor that follows a young singer's forays into the Greenwich Village folk music art scene of the 1960s.",

Over the years, nine of the Coens' films have screened at Cannes, from \"Raising Arizona\" in 1987 to \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" in 2013. They won the Palme d'Or in 1991 for \"Barton Fink,\" the festival's best-director award for \"Fargo\" and \"The Man Who Wasn't There,\" and the grand prize for \"Inside Llewyn Davis.\" '' http://bit.ly/1ukfgEP\n\nOLD KIDS ON THE BLOCK: Or something like that, per People, \"In a move that's sure to leave '80s and '90s kids reeling, New Kids on the Block just announced that they're embarking on another summer tour - with TLC and Nelly! \"There is no stopping us! We always have something up our sleeves,\" said Donnie Wahlberg, who revealed the tour news with the rest of the NKOTB crew - Joey McIntyre, Jordan Knight, Jonathan Knight and Danny Wood - Tuesday on Good Morning America.\" http://bit.ly/15riZLh\n\nSNIPER MUSINGS: Among other things, per Variety, \"Will \"American Sniper's\" gargantuan box office make it a surprise favorite at the Oscars? The Clint Eastwood drama about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle is peaking just days before voters are about to receive their ballots on Feb. 6. Over the long weekend, the Warner Bros. release made an estimated $105.3 million -- already more than any of the other best picture nominees.\n\n\"The Academy is often stubbornly immune to popular sentiment; \"Avatar,\" after all, lost to \"The Hurt Locker\" in 2010. And for that reason, I still think \"Boyhood\" is going to win best picture. It's the frontrunner that's picked up nearly every precursor award, and \"Sniper\" missed out on a crucial directing nomination for Eastwood. Only four films in Academy history (including 2012's \"Argo\") won picture without a director nomination.\" http://bit.ly/1xtmveX\n\nWHITNEY HOUSTON: Of negative vibes, per Rolling Stone, \"While Lifetime's Whitney Houston biopic was packed with many hell-to-the-yes moments, not everyone was happy to see a skewed version of the singer's life story on the small screen. Perhaps no one was more upset about Whitney than Houston's own family, who shared a long statement criticizing the unauthorized biopic on the singer's official site.\n\n\"The statement, penned by Houston's sister-in-law Pat Houston, slams Lifetime and director Angela Bassett for airing a subpar quality movie based on Houston's life from the perspective of ex-husband Bobby Brown.\" http://rol.st/17XrpLe\n\nWEIRD: Al, per Pitchfork, \"Following his latest album Mandatory Fun, his first album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard chart, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic has announced the massive \"Mandatory World Tour\". http://bit.ly/1538UTK\n\nBIEBER: Whatever, per Us Weekly, \"Buckle up, Beliebers!

                    "body": "1985 witnessed the debut of a number of notable filmmakers, starting in January with the singularly brilliant Blood Simple. A ripe slice of Texas noir as envisioned by a couple of nice Jewish boys from Minnesota, it didn't shatter box office records or make everyone rethink the genre. But as it toured various festivals in the months leading up to its theatrical release, everyone realized that a major new pair of talents had come to the forefront.\n\nThe most miraculous part was how those talents - brothers Joel and Ethan Coen - arrived seemingly fully formed with this movie, and while they certainly stretched their boundaries creatively in the ensuing three decades, they didn't require a lot of fine tuning to reach their creative potential. Blood Simple is an undeniably grim movie, marked by violence, greed and the kind of willful self-destruction that noir makes eerily beautiful. But the Coens also infuse it with a deeply sardonic sense of humor: the kind that makes you wonder if it's all some kind of massive put-on. Think you could never laugh at the sight of a man getting buried alive? Think again. Blood Simple understands the foolish absurdities of our own petty schemes, even as it shows us what happens when those schemes spin horrifically out of control.\n\nIt starts with a relatively straightforward double-cross. A scuzzy honky-tonk owner (Dan Hedaya) hires an equally scuzzy detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to murder his wife (Frances McDormand) and the bartender she's sleeping with (John Getz). Said detective instead doctors up some photos, shoots his would-be employer and sets up the philandering couple for the crime. Easy, right? Only if you know the genre you know that nothing ever goes according to plan - even if the plan is evil - and the resulting hash of mistakes, presumptions and hairpin turns leaves everyone compromised in thoroughly unpleasant ways.\n\nThe Coens never flinch away from the harsh stuff (see \"buried alive,\" above) and the fascinating scenario holds its share of nasty surprises for the audience. But they spring those details on us with such grace that we stay fast regardless of what's unfolding onscreen. The comedic elements serve the same purpose as the plot twists: to keep us off our guard and wondering feverishly what's going to hit us next. It's a tough balance. The brothers have to maintain the integrity of their scenario while quietly deflating it at the same time... and my God do they make it look easy. These characters all behave in ostensibly rational ways, following whatever bliss (money, sex, even love if you look hard enough) without much fuss or complaint. To see them stumble in such epically gruesome ways makes a testament to the folly of our own ambitions, and the way a few misperceptions can turn the easiest plan into a total cluster fuck.",

Se cumplen 120 a\u00f1os de la invenci\u00f3n del cinemat\u00f3grafo por los hermanos Lumi\u00e8re y quiz\u00e1s por eso, el Festival de Cannes ha decidido revolucionar su presidencia.\n\nPor primera vez en la historia, su jurado estar\u00e1 dirigido por dos personas. Y para completar la cuadratura del c\u00edrculo, ser\u00e1n, precisamente, dos hermanos quienes ostenten ese cargo. Son los conocidos como los hermanos Coen. Los cineastas estadounidenses Joel y Ethan Coen, realizadores de pel\u00edculas como 'Barton Fink', 'Fargo' o 'The Man Who Wasn't There', se han mostrado \"muy contentos de volver a Cannes\". En un comunicado publicado en la p\u00e1gina web oficial del festival han recalcado que \"Cannes es un festival que ha sido importante para nosotros desde el principio de nuestra carrera\".\n\nAmbos cineastas, que lograron la Palma de Oro en 1991 con 'Barton Fink', destacan adem\u00e1s la gran oportunidad que les da esta presidencia para ver pel\u00edculas del mundo entero, por lo que siempre \"estamos muy agradecidos\".\n\nLos dos hermanos, que se encuentran en pleno rodaje de la pel\u00edcula 'Hail Caesar!', con George Clooney, Christophe Lambert, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Josh Brolin y Channing Tatum, han a\u00f1adido que es un \"honor especial\" presidir el jurado de esta 68 edici\u00f3n. Porque dicen, \"nunca hemos sido hasta ahora presidentes de nada\".\n\nA la espera de conocer las candidaturas -la composici\u00f3n integra se conocer\u00e1 a mediados del pr\u00f3ximo mes de abril-, los Coen remiten a pr\u00f3ximos comunicados para conocer m\u00e1s detalles del evento, que tendr\u00e1 lugar el pr\u00f3ximo mes de mayo.\n\nLos directores de 'No es pa\u00eds para viejos' est\u00e1n considerados como unos de los cineastas m\u00e1s innovadores del panorama cinematogr\u00e1fico. Tanto que entre todos sus premios cuentan con cuatro premios Oscar, un Globo de Oro y en 2013 fueron galardonados con el Gran Premio del Jurado de Cannes por 'Inside Llewyn Davis'.",
