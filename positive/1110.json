                    "body": "Maya Angelou, the renowned poet, author and civil rights activist with the unmistakably regal voice, has died.  The author of the celebrated autobiography \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" was 86 years old.\n Officials in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where Angelou lived, confirmed her death to NBC News.\n Her death comes less than a week after Angelou announced she would not attend the 2014 MLB Beacon Awards Luncheon, where she was to be honored, citing \"health reasons.\" \" Last month, she also canceled an event in Fayetteville, Arkansas, because she was recovering from an \"unexpected ailment\" that left her hospitalized.\n \"The mayor is very saddened to hear the loss of a woman of such renowned phenomenal status as Dr. Angelou.  Our prayers are with her family, her staff and all the people she has worked with,\" Linda Jackson-Barnes, assistant to Winston-Salem Mayor Allen Joines, said.\n Angelou was born on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri, under the name Marguerite Annie Johnson, and was raised in Stamps, Arkansas, and San Francisco, after her parents sent her off to live with her grandmother in California when she was fresh with a white store clerk in Arkansas, the Associated Press reported.\n She grew up to become a singer, dancer, actress, writer and Hollywood's first female black director.\n Angelou had an impressive list of accolades: She was a three-time Grammy winner and was nominated for a Pulitzer, a Tony, and an Emmy for her role in the 1977 groundbreaking television mini-series \"Roots.\" \"\nBut her success didn't come easily.  Angelou's life struggles were fodder for her work.\n Her childhood had been marked by sexual abuse, which she detailed in \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" the first of six autobiographies she wrote.\n A few weeks after she finished high school, at 17, she gave birth to her son, Guy.  A single mother, she supported her son by working as a waitress and a cook, but music, dance, and poetry were her true passions.\n Her first big break came as a singer in the 1950s, when she toured Europe with a production of the opera \"Porgy and Bess.\" \" In 1957, she recorded her first album, \"Calypso Lady.\" \"\nIn 1960, she moved to Cairo, where she edited an English-language weekly newspaper.  The following year, she went to Ghana to teach music and drama.  It was in Ghana that she met Malcolm X, coming back to the U.S. in 1964 with him to help him build his new coalition, the Organization of African American Unity.\n It was in 1970 that she published \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" a painful tale of growing up in Jim Crow South, which is now on children's reading lists in schools across the country (along with sometimes being censored for its raw account of rape and teen pregnancy).\n \"'I thought that it was a mild book.  There's no profanity,\" Angelou once told the AP.  \"It speaks about surviving, and it really doesn't make ogres of many people.  I was shocked to find there were people who really wanted it banned, and I still believe people who are against the book have never read the book.\" \"\nBetween Angelou's fiction, non-fiction, and published verse, she amassed more than 30 best-selling titles.\n Angelou was also a trailblazer in film.  She wrote the screenplay and composed the score for the 1972 film \"Georgia,\" and the script, the first-ever by an African-American woman to be filmed, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\n In more recent years, it was her interactions with presidents that made headlines.  In 1993, she wowed the world when her reading of her poem \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" was broadcast live globally from former President Bill Clinton's first inauguration.  She stayed so close with the Clintons that in 2008, she supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy over Barack Obama's.\n In a statement Wednesday, President Obama called Angelou \"one of the brightest lights of our time.\" \"\n\"Michelle and I will always cherish the time we were privileged to spend with Maya.  With a kind word and a strong embrace, she had the ability to remind us that we are all God's children; that we all have something to offer,\" he said.\n Angelou also counted Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., as friends, and served as a mentor to Oprah Winfrey when Winfrey was starting out as a local TV reporter.\n Winfrey said in a statement Wednesday, \"What stands out to me most about Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken, it's how she lived her life.  She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence and a fierce grace.  I loved her and I know she loved me.  I will profoundly miss her.  She will always be the rainbow in my clouds.\" \"\nWhen she was in her 20s, Angelou also met Billie Holiday, who told her: \"You're going to be famous.  But it won't be for singing.\" \"\nAngelou read another poem, \"Amazing Peace,\" for former President George W. Bush at the 2005 Christmas tree-lighting ceremony at the White House.\n In North Carolina, Angelou lived in an 18-room house, the AP reported, and taught American Studies at Wake Forest University.

Winston-Salem Mayor Allen Joines confirmed Angelou's death to local media and said that she was found by her caretaker on Wednesday morning.\n Angelou had been suffering from long-term health problems and had canceled appearances at recent events because of her ailments.\n Maya Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St. Louis.  \"Maya\" had been a nickname given by her brother.\n In her memoir, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" Angelou told the story of her childhood, growing up in St. Louis, Long Beach, California, and Stamps, Arkansas.  One of the most controversial parts told of when Angelou went mute at seven-and-a-half after her mother's boyfriend, who had raped her, had been murdered.  She did not speak for more than five years, but it was during formative years of silence, Angelou said, that she fell in love with language.\n \"I thought my voice had killed the man.  And I thought if I spoke, my voice might just go out and kill anybody, randomly,\" Angelou said in a 2008 interview.  \"So I learned to read and I read every book I could find.  And I memorized.\" \"\nAs an adult, Angelou worked with Martin Luther King Jr. as a coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  She continued to write about civil rights and racism, never shying away from taboo subjects such as sex, abuse and violence.\n In an interview with the Academy of Achievement, Maya Angelou explained what it was like to personally experience racial discrimination.\n \"A black person grows up in this country -- and in many places -- knowing that racism will be as familiar as salt to the tongue.  Also, it can be as dangerous as too much salt.  I think that you must struggle for betterment for yourself and for everyone.  It is impossible to struggle for civil rights, equal rights for blacks, without including whites.  Because equal rights, fair play, justice, are all like the air; we all have it or none of us has it.  That is the truth of it.\" \"\nAngelou's talent could not be confined to just one medium.  Throughout her life, she was a poet, novelist, dancer, playwright, actor and educator.  She has written autobiographies, poems, children's books, essays, plays and screenplays.  Angelou has been awarded more than 50 honorary degrees and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2010 by President Barack Obama.",

No cause of death was given.\n Major League Baseball had planned to honor her in Houston on Friday as part of the Civil Rights Game festivities, but Angelou announced last week that she would be unable to attend due to health reasons.\n Angelou, who was also a civil rights activist, playwright, actress, singer, dancer and professor during her varied career, penned more than 30 books and won numerous awards, including the country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President Barack Obama in 2011.\n Her latest work, \"Mom & Me & Mom,\" about her mother and grandmother and what they taught her, was released last year.  In her last tweet on May 23, Angelou said, \"Listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of God.\" \"\nLiterary and entertainment figures, politicians and fans mourned her passing on Wednesday.\n Obama said his sister, Maya, was named for the author, whom he called \"a brilliant writer, a fierce friend and a truly phenomenal woman.\" \"\n\"A childhood of suffering and abuse actually drove her to stop speaking - but the voice she found helped generations of Americans find their rainbow amidst the clouds, and inspired the rest of us to be our best selves,\" Obama said in a statement.\n Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who frequently threw lavish birthday parties for Angelou and considered her a mentor, said she would remember her friend most for how she lived her life.\n \"She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence and a fierce grace,\" Winfrey said.\n Angelou, who was 6 feet tall, was born Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928.  She spent part of her childhood in Stamps, Arkansas with her grandmother after her parents divorced.\n At age 7, Angelou was raped by her mother's boyfriend, who was later beaten to death in an assault that some believed was carried out by Angelou's uncles.  The trauma of the rape and her assailant's death left Angelou mute for six years.\n She began writing during that silent period.  She would chronicle the first 17 years of her life in the 1969 autobiography \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" which her friend, writer James Baldwin, had encouraged her to write.\n The book, which covers the racism Angelou had faced in the 1930s and '40s and her fantasies of being blond and white, is considered an American classic.\n She never went to college but collected more than 30 honorary degrees.  As a teenager Angelou moved to San Francisco, where she pursued an entertainment career, became an unwed mother at 17 and also found a job as a streetcar conductor.\n Working as a calypso singer and dancer, she changed her name to Maya Angelou - based on a childhood nickname and the last name of her first of at least three husbands, Tosh Angelos.\n In the late 1950s she moved to New York and joined the Harlem Writers Guild before going to Africa, where she worked for newspapers in Cairo and Accra, Ghana.\n In subsequent years she mixed writing with singing and working on projects with civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. For years she did not celebrate her birthday because it coincided with the anniversary of King's assassination.\n Angelou also directed, wrote and acted in movies, plays and television programs and was a songwriter, educator and popular lecturer.  Her acting credits included a role in the ground-breaking television mini-series \"Roots\" and she wrote the script and score for the movie \"Georgia, Georgia.\" \"\nShe was a Grammy winner for three spoken-word albums.\n Nathan O. Hatch, the president of Wake Forest University, where Angelou had been a professor of American studies since 1982, said she was a \"towering figure\" at the school and in American culture with a profound influence in civil rights and racial reconciliation.\n In addition to \"Mom & Me & Mom,\" Angelou's other autobiographical works included \"Gather Together in My Name,\" \"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas,\" \"A Song Flung Up to Heaven,\" \"Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now,\" \"The Heart of a Woman\" and \"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes.\" \"\nAt Bill Clinton's request, Angelou wrote \"On the Pulse of Morning\" and recited the poem at his 1993 presidential inauguration.\n \"We share the gratitude of so many for Dr. Angelou's contributions to literature, human rights, and social justice.  Her legacy is one that all writers and readers across the world can admire and aspire to,\" said Harold Augenbraum, the executive director of the National Book Foundation.

But she lived many lives.  From her stint as a calypso dancer to her civil rights activism, she had adventures, interests, and life experiences that transcended the world of words.  Her biggest fans already know these 11 details of her life, and the rest of us can use them as a starting point to begin to paint a full picture of her rich, multilayered time on this Earth.\n 1.  Ever-Changing Names\nAngelou was born Marguerite Ann Johnson.  Her brother Bailey nicknamed her \"Maya\".  When she began her career as a night club calypso singer and dancer in San Francisco, she dropped Margueritte and took on the stage name, Maya Angelou.\n 2.  A High School Education with Cable Car Break\nAngelou dropped out of high school as a teen.  At the age of 16, she became the first black street car operator in San Francisco.  She did give high school another try and graduated a few weeks before giving birth to her son Guy.\n 3.  Civil Rights Leadership and a Friendship with Malcolm X\nAngelou was active in the Civil Rights Movement.  She became the Northern Coordinator of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization central to Martin Luther King's success.  She also worked with Malcolm X. After meeting Malcolm X in Ghana, she planned to return to the United States to help him develop his new Organization of Afro-American Unity.  Unfortunately, X was assassinated not long after they started working together.\n 4.  Appearances on Everyone's Favorite Kids' Show\nAngelou was a guest star on Sesame Street many times in the 1990s.  Watch a video of her 1999 appearance below.\n 5.  Writing and Sipping\nAngelou was known to drink sherry, while she wrote.\n 6.  A Half-Decade of Silence\nAt the age of seven, Angelou stopped speaking publicly for five years after she was sexually assaulted by her mother's boyfriend.  During that time, she began writing.  She later wrote the autobiography, \"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,\" which detailed the first seventeen years of her life.\n 7.  Poets: They're Just Like Us (When it Comes to TV, at Least)\nAngelou was an avid Law & Order fan.\n 8.  Comfortable Footwear Fan\nAngelou loved to wear Uggs.\n 9.  Love Notes (of the Commercial Variety)\nAngelou wrote Hallmark greetings and defended her decision to her Random House editor who remarked that her work with Hallmark was too commercial.\n 10.  Diverse Taste in Tunes\nAngelou was a lover of country music.  Some of her favorites included Carrie Underwood, Blake Shelton, and Jessica Nettles.\n 11.  Camaradarie With Another Legend\nAngelou was friends with Nelson Mandela.  The two met in Cairo in 1962, while Angelou was working as a journalist.  When Mandela passed away in 2013, Angelou recited a poem in a video sponsored by the U. S. Department of State.\n Like The Root on Facebook.

                    "body": "She is dressed in black, gems shining from her shoes, as she perches regally on the stiff couch in her living room.  She is tall, having finally grown into the big feet she fretted over so as a girl growing up in tiny Stamps, Ark.\nShe is well-heeled, having said goodbye to abject poverty years ago by means of her success as a performer, writer and teacher.  The house is a big one, all right - white columns outside and lots of high ceilings and tasteful art inside.\n She is well-connected, too.  Angelou worked shoulder-to-shoulder with Martin Luther King Jr., knew Malcolm X, called James Baldwin ''Jimmy,'' and now lists Quincy Jones and Oprah Winfrey among her more famous pals.  Winfrey calls Angelou her ''mother'' and pays an occasional weekend visit here.  You can imagine the commotion down at Mount Zion Baptist Church when Maya Angelou and Oprah Winfrey stroll in for Sunday morning services.\n Yes, the voice is a big one, but there is more at work here than well-crafted vocal cords.\n ''I believe that every person is born with talent,'' she says.  ''I think that each of us comes from the Creator trailing wisps of glory.' '' She gives a dramatic sweep of the hand.\n ''Take electricity.  We use it, but we don't understand it.  You can light up this room or light up a cathedral or a synagogue, or you can electrocute a person strapped into a chair.  Electricity makes no demands.  It says, 'If you are intelligent, you will use me intelligently.  If not, you will misuse me.' ' I think talent is like that.' ''\nSuch an assumption must seem natural for Maya Angelou , born Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis 62 years ago this month.  From a neglected childhood that included being raped by her mother's boyfriend, she made herself into a dancer, an actor, a singer, writer, a producer, a teacher, an activist.  A celebrity.\n Her first book, the inspiring, autobiographical ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' was nominated for a National Book Award in 1970, and is now required reading at some colleges.  This month, Angelou will publish her sixth volume of poetry.  She wrote the screenplay for ''Georgia, Georgia,'' the first original script by a black woman to be produced on television, got an Emmy nomination for her acting job in ''Roots,'' and has been named to an endless number of ''most influential'' lists.  Most recently, Angelou finished third, behind Winfrey and Coretta Scott King, in the ''most admired black female'' category of an Ebony magazine Readers Poll.\n ''She's such a role model, especially for my students,'' says Dr. Soyini Madison, who uses Angelou 's poetry in a course in ''Third World Women's Performance Traditions'' at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  ''My students probably do more of Maya Angelou 's work than just about anybody's, because her poetry is so accessible to them.  It's clear they understand it, and it's very inspirational.  Its hard to go to any student production without at least one poem of hers being performed.' ''\nThe inspiration comes directly from Angelou 's life, the early part of which was spent in segregated Arkansas.  Although she was a single mother and largely self-educated, she set her sights on a stage career and began to study drama and dance.  She earned a scholarship to study dance with Pearl Primus in New York and later joined the European touring company of ''Porgy and Bess.' ''\nShe married an African freedom fighter, Vusumzi Make, now one of so many ex-husbands that she does not discuss how many times she has been wed, and moved with him to Egypt during the early '60s.  She brought along her son, Guy, by then 15 years old.  Angelou became associate editor of the Arab Observer.\n When the marriage failed, she and Guy moved to Ghana, where she became assistant administrator of the School of Music and Drama at the University of Ghana.  In 1966, she became feature editor of the African Review.\n When she returned to the United States, King asked her to become northern coordinator for the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference.  Beginning in 1970 with the publication of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' a larger audience found Maya Angelou .  She got roles on the stage and on the screen, and her plays and poems were adapted for both.  Colleges began to shower her with honorary doctorates.\n In 1981, she left San Francisco for Winston-Salem, where Wake Forest University had offered her a lifetime appointment as Reynolds Professor of American Studies.  Here, she has continued to write her poems, essays, books, plays and songs.  Recently, she wrote lyrics for some 20 songs for ''King,'' a stage musical now ready to debut in London.  Last month, Angelou , angry over the depiction of the late Martin Luther King Jr. as a ''crass opportunist,'' withdrew her support from the play and disavowed her lyrics.\n ''Emerson said, 'In evil times, the only place for a noble man is jail or exile.' ' '' she says.  ''Well, I thought the only way for me to act nobly was to withdraw.  I couldn't withdraw my lyrics.  I'm legally bound; I've signed a contract.  But in making the statement that I withdrew support, I wanted them to know I would not go gentle into that dark night.  I would not allow what I considered to be a travesty to be foisted upon the public without my saying anything about it.' ''\nNot that Angelou has ever been one to go gentle, be it night or day.  She suffers fools badly, if at all.  Reporters asking inane questions can expect verbal decapitation, and inattentive audiences will hear the bitter truth about their rudeness.  But while Angelou can be honest to the point of bluntness, she also can be exceedingly gracious, say her friends.\n '' Maya Angelou is the most unique personality you would ever want to meet,'' says Dr. Serenus T. Churn, her pastor at Mount Zion Baptist Church.  ''She is indeed famous and she is indeed a celebrity, but she never assumes that posture in the church.  She's not the kind of person who boasts or brags or is ostentatious in her presence.  She is quiet and unassuming.  yet all of her friends recognize that she is a very spiritual woman.' ''\nEvery fall, Angelou produces a special concert at Mount Zion, often writing original lyrics for the choir to perform.  Scores of visitors pack into the church to see what Angelou hath wrought.\n '' Maya gives her talents,'' says Churn.  ''Sometimes, to be honest with you, she underwrites the expense of bringing in other talent.  She does her works of charity anonymously.  There will be times when she will see a need and say to me, 'If you get the estimate for this, I'll take care of it.' ' A year ago, she bought Christmas meals for a number of needy families, complete with toys for the children and trimming for the trees.  She swore me to secrecy.' ''\nPutting a definitive label on Angelou is impossible.  Is she actor, writer, singer, songwriter, activist, teacher?  Or is she a homebody at heart who loves nothing better than to cook meals for friends like High Point businessman Robert Brown?  Lately, she has been mostly lecturer, she says.\n ''It seems I've done nothing but that for the last two and a half or three months,'' she says.  ''But I'm cutting back in the fall.  I don't have the energy.  I find that in order to get the work done I do, I have to be totally present.  In this time with you, I am totally present.  All my everything is here.  You can't continue to do that every day with a different audience and fly, you know, when you've reached the age I've reached.\n ''And I still have my writing to do.  I'm writing a film for Harry Belafonte now.  I have a new series for PBS, which is to begin in the fall.  It's called ' Maya Angelou 's America.' ' I just have to cut back.' ''\nWhen she is writing hard, Angelou leaves her house every morning before 6 a.m. and locks herself in a rented hotel room.\n ''I keep the room for two months at a time,'' she says.  ''I ask the people not to do anything to the room, because I never sleep in it.  I keep my yellow pads and my Bible and my dictionary and Roget's Thesaurus and a deck of cards and a bottle of sherry in there.\n ''I stay there till 12.  Sometimes, if the work is going very well, I will stay until 1, but then I leave.  It's a wonderful way of working.  I can't seem to write in my own home, no matter where it is.  It is so full of possibilities of being distracted.' ''\nMuch of her time in recent years has been devoted to teaching.  Besides her post at Wake Forest, she has held various visiting professorships.  This semester, she is teaching one day at week at Radford University in southern Virginia.  Among the courses she has taught is one she designed herself: ''The Philosophy of Liberation.' ''\nWhat is the difference between someone who wants social change and someone who wants merely to ''exchange'' positions with another, she asks students.  What is liberation?  Can one person help liberate another, or is it a personal and unique experience we must go through alone?\n''I don't know of any single answer,'' she says, ''but it makes for a provocative study.  The class started at 2 and ended at 5, and usually there were still people there at 5:30 saying I disagree or I agree.  That was fascinating.  I want to teach it again, maybe in the fall.' ''\nThen Angelou excitedly describes another course she will teach, a drama seminar this spring at Wake Forest.\n ''I want to use the outer concept of an African folk-telling system, in which one person calls another out and makes her join into the story and she calls another out, and so forth, and once the people are all out, they can become anybody.  The storyteller may say, 'The three of you over there will become children.' ' ''\nThe inner parameter would be a Western concert form.  ''In this case, women will wear black, long dresses and pearls, and men will wear tuxedos, and there will be a podium and risers,'' says Angelou .\n The class will tackle works by Robert Frost, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson.  ''Just a wonderful mix of world poetry,'' says Angelou .  The students will perform two poems - Dunbar's ''When Malindy Sings,'' and Robert Burns' ''A Man's a Man for a' That'' - in tandem.\n ''I want them to hear the black American dialect and the Scotch dialect and see that one is not better than the other,'' she says.  ''In fact, there is no difference between them except in the melody.' ''\nSuddenly, shifting her tone to a young girl's lilt, Angelou launches into ''When Malindy Sings:''\nThen, with hardly a breath in between, her dialect switches to Scotch:\n''They're going to DO it, and we'll have a good time,'' says Angelo, laughing, now back in her own biblical voice.\n Stereotypes result from ignorance and laziness, she says.  ''They simplify your life.  You say, 'That's a black man.  That's a white guy.  That's an addict.  That's a blonde.  That's a kid.' ' As if that then expresses and describes all that person is.' ''\nShe quotes Terence, the ancient Roman who went from slavery to stature as the best playwright of his day: ''I am a human being.  Nothing can be alien to me.' ''\n''When you internalize some of that saying, one is liberated,'' says Angelou .  ''I think this is so for anything - even singing or dancing.' '' Angelou writes musical lyrics without being able to read music; she is exceptionally well read, even though most of her degrees are honorary.  She sees few barriers anywhere.\n ''The principal dancer in Ghana is a woman about 55 years old.  Whenever a head of state visits, this woman dances.  She comes out with her handkerchief and begins a dance of welcome that just takes the heart.  It means she doesn't have to be a size 8 and on points to dance.  And you know from hearing Ray Charles and Louis Armstrong that you don't have to have bel canto sound in order to sing.' ''\nAll things are possible, she says, even in this not so best of political climates.\n ''In our country, I think we have been drugged.  I don't know how.  I really think about this a lot.  You see, we are acting as if we're swimming under water.  Everything is in slow motion.  We know the truth.  We know what is right to do.  We know it, and yet we pretend we haveforgotten.  That makes me think that somehow we have come under the influence of a very negative cloud.\n ''We have a chance to do the right thing, and yet we choose to do something that will embarrass us.  We have a chance to help the elderly, and we cut their pensions.  We have a chance to encourage children in school and increase education, which we desperately need, and we cut aid and help to the children.  We are bombarded by various kinds of illnesses - AIDS, cancer, heart trouble, MS - and we cut the moneys that would go to research and put it into military increases.  It's as if we have an epidemic of madness.  I liken us to the children of Israel stumbling around for 40 years in the desert.  Much in need of a savior.  Much of need of being called to order.' ''\nNot that we can't do it, she says.  But it will take a mighty effort.  ''I think that we have the responsibility to take our lives and our country and our morality into our hands and be better human beings.  We have to do it.  It's our lives, after all.' ''\nMaya Angelou has to leave now.  She has to give a lecture today, and there is too much other work to do.  She's definitely going to cut back in the fall.",

Her poetry and writing taught important lessons on resilience and activism.\n Her agent told ABC News:\nShe'd been very frail and had heart problems, but she was going strong, finishing a new book.  I spoke to her yesterday.  She was fine, as she always was.  Her spirit was indomitable.\n Here's what you need to know about the American icon:\nWednesday morning at around 8:15 a.m., Time Warner News reported that Angelou was found unresponsive in her Winston-Salem, North Carolina home.  The cause of death was not immediately known, and memorial and funeral arraignments have not yet been released.\n On May 23, Angelou announced she would not attend the MLB Beacon Awards, where she was being honored.  The AP reported that she cited \"health Reasons\" when declining the invitation.  In April, Angelou was hospitalized when an \"unexpected ailment\" prevented her from attending an event in Arkansas.\n Angelou made history in 1993 when she became the first black poet and the first female poet (and just the second overall) to recite a poem at a presidential inauguration.  Her reading of \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at President Bill Clinton's first inauguration made her the first poet to read at an inauguration since Robert Frost read \"The Gift Outright\" at John F. Kennedy's in 1961.\n She won a Grammy Award in the \"spoken word\" category for the poem in 1994.\n Watch the video of Angelou reciting the poem above, and read the full text of the poem here.\n Angelou is best known for her immortal memoir, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, which was published in 1969 and covers the early years of her life.  The book was followed by six additional autobiographies, each covering a section of her life.\n Above you can listen to Angelou reading from \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nAngelou has received dozens of awards and honors over the years, including more than 20 honorary degrees, the Mother Teresa Award, the National Medal of Arts, the NAACP Image Award, three Grammys for spoken word recordings, the Langston Hughes Medal, a Pulitzer Nomination, and a Tony nomination.  Angelou also won the highest honor an American civilian can win, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which you can see a picture of her receiving above.",

Click here for The New York Times' obit.\n The Times Union's Paul Grondahl spoke with Angelou in May 2008, when she brought her poetry to Albany's Palace Theatre.\n By PAUL GRONDAHL\nThe woman who's been called a national treasure is going to play the Palace, even if she expresses amazement that people are willing to pay up to $80 a ticket.\n How's it feel to be a rock star, Maya Angelou, traveling to gigs in a custom tour bus? \"It's wonderful,\" she says with a throaty laugh.\n \"I've had 10,000 people fill an arena and pay to hear an old black woman talk of love, of poetry, of laughter.  I guess it means I belong to everybody.\" \"\nAmerican literature's Everywoman will bring to her Tuesday performance in Albany a regal bearing, inspirational life lessons and lyrical stories from her experiences as poet, professor, Creole cook, civil rights activist, best-selling memoirist, streetcar conductor, single parent, cocktail waitress, dancer, actress, playwright, songwriter, movie producer and historian.\n \"Art Linkletter said growing old is not for sissies, and I know I'm not a sissy,\" she says.  \"I'm growing old with laughter, writing, singing, eating, respect for my body and my fellow man and woman,\" she says.\n On stage\nThe solo artist and mistress of reinvention walks onstage with a cane, takes a seat on a stool to give her aching knees a break.  She entertains an audience for an hour or more, without notes, reciting poems by memory.\n \"I start out with a plan, but the plan is agile and maybe something happened that day with a student that makes me think of something else,\" she says.  \"Or I may see somebody in the audience who looks a certain way and that reminds me of a poem or a life event.\" \"\nAlthough she never went to college, Angelou has been awarded more than 30 honorary degrees and prefers to be called Dr. Angelou - Dr. A to friends.  She's been a professor of American studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., since 1981.\n She's speaking by phone from her home in Winston-Salem, a month after good friend Oprah Winfrey threw her an extravagant 80th birthday celebration on April 4 at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\"It was just an amazing party,\" says Angelou, who was serenaded by Tony Bennett, Natalie Cole and Jessye Norman before Angelou was brought onstage by Ashford and Simpson singing \"I'm Every Woman.\" \"\nWinfrey and Angelou have been close friends for more than two decades, and for Angelou's 70th birthday the TV diva hosted a weeklong Caribbean cruise for Angelou and 150 guests.\n But the two friends part ways when it comes the presidential election.  Angelou supports Hillary Rodham Clinton and Winfrey backs Barack Obama.\n \"It doesn't get in the way of our friendship, because we don't really discuss it,\" Angelou says.\n \"Oprah thinks seriously and long about things, she has a good brain and she's deduced that Sen.  Obama will be her ideal president of the United States.  I, too, have thought long and hard about it, and Sen.  Clinton to me will be the ideal president for my country,\" she says.\n In the beginning\nAngelou grew up with a grandmother in racially segregated Stamps, Ark. She was sexually molested at 7 by her mother's boyfriend, became a single parent at 17 and recalls the Arkansas of her childhood as \"mean and hopeless.\" \"\n\"I've been watching Hillary Clinton for over 25 years starting in Little Rock, when she was concerned about the have-nots and education and public health, and she wasn't just a governor's wife who invited the haves over for tea parties,\" Angelou says.\n Angelou's career vaulted after she read her poem, \"On the Pulse of the Morning,\" at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in January 1993.\n \"I was impressed by what she did when she went to the White House, and I said, 'If she ever runs for anything, I'm going to support her,' Angelou says.  \"I like Mr. Obama a lot, and if I had met him that long ago, it's likely that I would support him.\" \"\nAngelou is more interested in talking about presidential imperatives rather than personalities.\n \"We need a president with courage and not braggadocio, a real solid courage to say what she or he sees and to act for the common good,\" Angelou says.\n Angelou divides her time between her 18-room mansion in Winston-Salem (the city also threw her a huge 80th birthday party) and a 12-room town house in Harlem, which she had gutted and restored a few years ago.\n Angelou is no stranger to the Capital Region.  She spoke at Union College in Schenectady last October and at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy in 2003.\n \"The topography is wonderful there and it's so beautiful in May,\" she says.  \"I look forward to seeing what new things are coming out of Albany.\" \"\nPaul Grondahl can be reached at 454-5623 or by e-mail at pgrondahl@timesunion.com.\n A feel-good evening What: An evening with Maya Angelou When: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday Where: Palace Theatre, 19 Clinton Ave., Albany Note: The event is promoted by Unique Lives & Experiences, a women's lecture series, in conjunction with media sponsor the Times Union and presenting sponsor Frank Adams Jewelers Tickets: begin at $25 Info: 465-3335; http://www.palacealbany.com",

                    "body": "The world knew Maya Angelou, who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 86, as a prolific writer and poet.  But she had a long string of other jobs throughout her life.\n From a cable car conductor to a shake dancer in a nightclub, Angelou's odd jobs seem out of place in a life associated with prose.  But when woven together, these were the experiences that made Marguerite Ann Johnson (Angelou's birth name) the person she was.\n Here are 15 of them.\n Angelou went to school in San Francisco to study dance, and though she dropped out at 14, her passion for it never seemed to fizzle.  At six feet tall, Angelou had an unforgettable stage presence, and she eventually went on to perform in many very different venues.\n Shortly after dropping out of school, Angelou became San Francisco's first black female streetcar conductor at age 16.  In one of her many interviews with Oprah Winfrey, Angelou said when she first went to place an application, the staff refused to give her one.  However, her mother encouraged her to keep pursuing the job, telling her to work harder than anyone else.  Angelou said it seemed like a dream job, adding, \"I loved the uniforms.\" \"\nAfter she gave birth at age 16, Angelou bounced around from a series of jobs in order to support her son, which she chronicled in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas.  One of those jobs was a \"shake dancer in a nightclub.\" \"\nIn that same memoir, Angelou wrote that one of those jobs included working in a mechanic's shop, where she would remove paint from cars with her hands.\n Angelou was a fry cook in a hamburger joint, and she passed herself off as an experienced Creole chef to get a job as a dinner cook -- even though she had no idea what she was doing when it came to Creole food.  Though she started off with little cooking knowledge, she eventually wrote Hallelujah!  The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories With Recipes.  In the recipe book, she includes sometimes-hilarious backstories associated with each dish.\n As a teenage mother, a struggling Angelou faced darker periods in her life in which she worked less-than-legitimate jobs.  One of those included a madam for lesbian prostitutes and a brief, unsuccessful stint as a prostitute herself.  She later described these experiences in Gather Together in My Name, a book she said was the most painful thing she's ever written.  In one interview, Angelou said that, though the experience gave her a rich life, she doesn't suggest it for just anybody.\n [.. .] ] If you happen to fall into that sort of experience, what you have to do is forgive yourself.  If you're in the very gutter, see where you are and admit it.  As soon as you admit it, you can be like the prodigal son, the prodigal daughter.  Get up and go home - wherever home is.  Get up and go to a safe place, someplace where your spirit is not kicked and brutalized and your body not misused and abused.  Get up.  But you can't get up unless you see where you are and admit it.  I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, \"I never did anything wrong.  Who, Moi? - never I. I have no skeletons in my closet.  In fact, I have no closet.\" \" They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, \"Damn I must be a pretty bad guy.  My mom or dad never did anything wrong.\" \" They can't forgive themselves and go on with their lives.  So I wrote the book Gather Together in My Name.  Meaning that all those grown people, all those adults, all those parents and grandparents and teachers and preachers and rabbis and priests who lie to the children can gather together in my name and I will tell them the truth.  Wherever you are, you have got to admit it and set about to make a change.\n After one of her divorces, Angelou, whose real name was Marguerite, tried to make it as a calypso singer and danger.  This is when she adopted the name that everyone in the world would come to know her by.  Maya Angelou was a variation of her married name (her ex-husband's name was Tosh Angelos).\n As a calypso dancer, Angelou sometimes hooked up with Alvin Ailey -- a revered choreographer who is credited for bringing modern dance to the mainstream -- for nightclub dance gigs in San Francisco.\n After falling in love with Vusumzi L. Make, a South African civil rights activist, Angelou moved to Cairo, where she worked as the associate editor of The Arab Observer from 1962 to 1963.  At that time, the magazine was the only English-language news weekly in the Middle East.\n Angelou eventually left Make in the 1960s and then moved to Ghana and took a features editor position at the African Review in Accra.  She worked there from 1964 to 1966, during the days of decolonization.\n Ghana seemingly had a huge impact on Angelou's life because it set her on course to becoming a powerful voice in the civil rights movement.  While simultaneously working as an editor and an administrative assistant at the University of Ghana, she met Malcolm X.\nOne year later, she moved back to the U.S. to help Malcolm X set up his Organization of African-American Unity, but it fell apart after his assassination.  Angelou went on to work with Dr. Martin Luther King to help him set up the Southern Christina Leadership Conference.  Angelou was devastated when King was killed, which was on her 40th birthday.  That's when Angelou threw herself into her writing and penned her first memoirs.\n Angelou appeared on stage and in front of the camera several times as both a dancer and actress.  Though she was cast in the Broadway musical \"House of Flowers\" in 1954, Angelou turned it down for a world tour of \"Porgy and Bess,\" in which she was a featured dancer.  But she eventually got her chance again on Broadway in 1973 when she appeared in \"Look Away,\" a play about Mary Todd Lincoln and her seamstress.  It closed after only one performance, but that single run was enough to earn Angelou a Tony Award nomination.\n She famously appeared in the television mini-series Roots in 1977, and that same year she played Willie's wife in the TV movie The Richard Pryor Special?, for which she received a writing credit.  But she was also in several films and TV series throughout the 1990s and early 2000s: Poetic Justice (1993), There Are No Children Here (1993), How to Make an American Quilt (1995) and even Madea's Family Reunion (2006).\n With the hard lessons and diverse experiences that made up Angelou's life, it seems fitting that one of her final jobs would be as a teacher.  In 1982, Angelou took the position of Reynolds professor of American studies at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.\n As Oprah once said, Angelou \"is the quintessential teacher because she has paid attention to everything [...] she hasn't missed a moment.\" \"",

                    "body": "Maya Angelou, the memoirist and poet whose landmark book of 1969, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" - which describes in lyrical, unsparing prose the author's girlhood in the Jim Crow South - was among the first autobiographies by a 20th century black woman to reach a wide general readership, died Wednesday in her home.  She was 86 and lived in Winston-Salem, N.C.\nHer death was confirmed by her longtime literary agent, Helen Brann.  No immediate cause of death had been determined, but Brann said Angelou had been in frail health for some time and had had heart problems.\n As well-known as she was for her memoirs, which eventually filled six volumes, Angelou very likely received her widest exposure on a chilly January day in 1993, when she delivered the inaugural poem, \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" at the swearing-in of Bill Clinton, the nation's 42nd president, who, like Angelou, had grown up poor in rural Arkansas.\n But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,\nLong before that day, as she recounted in \"Caged Bird\" and its five sequels, she already had been a dancer, calypso singer, streetcar conductor, single mother, magazine editor in Cairo, administrative assistant in Ghana, official of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and friend or associate of some of the most eminent black Americans of the mid-20th century, including James Baldwin, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.\nAfterward (her six-volume memoir takes her only to the age of 40), Angelou was a Tony-nominated stage actress; college professor (she was for many years the Reynolds professor of American studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem); ubiquitous presence on the lecture circuit; frequent guest on television shows, from \"Oprah\" to \"Sesame Street\"; and subject of a string of scholarly studies.\n In February 2011, President Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.\n Throughout her writing, Angelou explored the concepts of personal identity and resilience through the multifaceted lens of race, sex, family, community and the collective past.  As a whole, her work offered a clear-eyed examination of the ways in which the socially marginalizing forces of racism and sexism played out at the level of the individual.\n \"If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat,\" Angelou wrote in \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nHallmarks of Angelou's prose style included a directness of voice that recalls African-American oral tradition and gives her work the quality of testimony.  She was also intimately concerned with sensation, describing the world around her - be it Arkansas, San Francisco or the foreign cities in which she lived - with palpable feeling for its sights, sounds and smells.\n \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" published when Angelou was in her early 40s, spans only her first 17 years.  But what powerfully formative years they were.\n Marguerite Ann Johnson was born in St. Louis on April 4, 1928.  (For years after King's assassination, on April 4, 1968, Angelou did not celebrate her birthday.) )\nHer beautiful, volatile mother, Vivian Baxter, was variously a nurse, hotel owner and card dealer.\n As a girl, Angelou was known as Rita, Ritie or Maya, her older brother's childhood nickname for her.\n Their grandmother, Annie Henderson, owned a general store \"in the heart of the Negro area,\" Angelou wrote.  An upright woman known as Momma, \"with her solid air packed around her like cotton,\" she is a warm, stabilizing presence throughout \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nThe children returned periodically to St. Louis to live with their mother.  On one such occasion, when Maya was 7 or 8 (her age varies slightly across her memoirs, which employ the techniques of fiction to recount actual events), she was raped by her mother's boyfriend.\n She told her brother, who alerted the family, and the man was tried and convicted.  Before he could begin serving his sentence, he was murdered - probably, Angelou wrote, by her uncles.\n Believing that her words had brought about the death, Maya did not speak for the next five years.  Her love of literature, as she later wrote, helped restore language to her.\n As a teenager, now living with her mother in San Francisco, she studied dance and drama at the California Labor School and became the first black woman to work as a streetcar conductor there.  At 16, after a casual liaison with a neighborhood youth, she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.  There the first book ends.\n The book - its title is a line from \"Sympathy,\" by the African-American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar - became a best seller, confounding the pervasive stereotype that black women's lives were unworthy of memoir.\n The next five volumes of Angelou's memoir, all, like the first, originally published by Random House, were \"Gather Together in My Name\" (1974), \"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas\" (1976), \"The Heart of a Woman\" (1981), \"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes\" (1986) and \"A Song Flung Up to Heaven\" (2002).\n Together they describe her struggles to support her son through a series of odd jobs.\n \"Determined to raise him, I had worked as a shake dancer in nightclubs, fry cook in hamburger joints, dinner cook in a Creole restaurant and once had a job in a mechanic's shop, taking paint off cars with my hands,\" she wrote in \"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas.\" \" Elsewhere, she describes her brief unsuccessful stint as a prostitute and brief successful one as a madam.\n After her marriage dissolved, she embarked on a career as a calypso dancer and singer under the name Maya Angelou, a variant of her married name.  A striking stage presence - she was 6 feet tall - she occasionally partnered in San Francisco with Alvin Ailey in a nightclub dance act known as Al and Rita.\n She was cast in the Truman Capote-Harold Arlen musical \"House of Flowers,\" which opened on Broadway in 1954.  But she chose instead to tour the world as a featured dancer in a production of \"Porgy and Bess\" by the Everyman Opera Company, a black ensemble.\n Angelou later settled in New York, where she became active in the Harlem Writers Guild (she hoped to be a poet and playwright), sang at the Apollo and eventually succeeded Bayard Rustin as the coordinator of the New York office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization that he, King and others had founded.\n In the early 1960s, Angelou became romantically involved with Vusumzi L. Make, a South African civil rights activist.  She moved with him to Cairo, where she became the associate editor of a magazine, the Arab Observer.  After leaving Make - she found him paternalistic and controlling, she later wrote - she moved to Accra, Ghana, where she was an administrative assistant at the University of Ghana.\n On returning to New York, Angelou helped Malcolm X set up the Organization of Afro-American Unity, established in 1964.  The group dissolved after his assassination the next year.\n In 1973, Angelou appeared on Broadway in \"Look Away,\" a two-character play about Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Geraldine Page) and her seamstress.  Though the play closed after one performance, Angelou was nominated for a Tony Award.  On the screen, she portrayed Kunta Kinte's grandmother in the 1977 television mini-series \"Roots\" and appeared in several feature films, including \"How to Make an American Quilt\" (1995).\n Angelou's marriage in the 1970s to Paul du Feu, who had previously been wed to the feminist writer Germaine Greer, ended in divorce.\n Over time, some critics expressed reservations about Angelou's prose, calling it facile and solipsistic.  Her importance as a literary, cultural and historical figure was amply borne out, however, by the many laurels she received, including a slew of honorary doctorates.\n Her other books include the volumes of poetry \"Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie\" (1971), \"Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well\" (1975); \"And Still I Rise\" (1978); and \"Shaker, Why Don't You Sing?\" (1983).\n She released an album of songs, \"Miss Calypso,\" in 1957.\n But she remained best known for her memoirs, a striking fact in that she had never set out to be a memoirist.  Near the end of \"A Song Flung Up to Heaven,\" Angelou recalls her response when Robert Loomis, who would become her longtime editor at Random House, first asked her to write an autobiography.\n She demurred at first, still planning to be a playwright and poet.  Cannily, Loomis called her again.\n \"You may be right not to attempt autobiography, because it is nearly impossible to write autobiography as literature,\" he said.  \"Almost impossible.\" \"",

                    "body": "Novelist, poet, activist, and more was one of the most powerful voices of an era\nMaya Angelou, the writer and civil rights activist whose bold and populist voice echoed across decades of American and global culture, has died.  Winston-Salem Mayor Allen Joines told the local Fox 8 news station that the I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings memoirist was found at home by her caretaker early this morning (May 28).  She was 86.\n Angelou had recently canceled an event in her honor, citing an undisclosed illness.  Wake Forest University, where she had served a professor since 1982, reportedly said it might anounce details about a campus memorial at a later date.  \"Dr. Angelou was a national treasure whose life and teachings inspired millions around the world,\" the school said in a statement.  \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Angelou's family and friends during this difficult time.\" \"\nAs poet, novelist, activist, educator, actress, singer, dancer, filmmaker, theatrical producer, and more, Angelou's influence is incalculable.  \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel,\" she said, in one of her more oft-quoted statements.  She famously recited a poem at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inaugural ceremony, and in 2011 President Barack Obama awarded her the Medal of Freedom.\n Born on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri, Angelou split her youth between St. Louis and Stamps, Arkansas, which was racially segrated.  She fell into a multi-year silence after a tragedy at age 7: Her mother's boyfriend raped her, and not long after she testified against the man, he was killed.  She said she felt as if her voice had killed him, so she stopped speaking.  When her voice returned, it was with great strength, as she went on to write the 1969 autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n With friends ranging from Martin Luther King Jr. to Oprah Winfrey, Angelou's reach extended far beyond the world of music.  But within it, too, her spirit could be felt.  A cautionary voice against \"vulgarity\" in her later years, she could be considered a patron saint of conscious rap, a fact that was illuminated all the more when she differed with rapper Common in 2011 over his use of \"the 'N' word.\" \" Fiona Apple, who has claimed Angelou as her hero, quoted the poet in a much-discussed 1997 MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech.  Queen Latifah read an Angelou poem at Michael Jackson's 2009 memorial.  Kanye West referred to Angelou on Late Registration's \"Hey Mama\" and wrote in a 2010 blog post that he wanted to follow in her footsteps.\n Asked in 2009 what from her long career was her proudest achievement, Angelou told The Des Moines Register: \"I'm a mother, grandmother, great-grandmother.  I'm a teacher.  I've been a wife.  I've been a sister -- those interactive relationships.  I don't know about pride.\" \"\nBelow, see Angelou reading her poem \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration.  Scroll down to see her final tweet.",

                    "body": "104 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\nPoet and essayist Maya Angelou died Wednesday at the age of 86, according to reports in her hometown of Winston-Salem.\n Winston-Salem Mayor Allen Joines told WFMY News 2 that Angelou's caregiver found her dead in her home Wednesday morning.\n Angelou is best known for her award-winning-writing, including I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n Angelou was a high school dropout who went to become a professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University.\n She was an American Study herself.  \"I have created myself,\" she told USA TODAY in 2007, \"I have taught myself so much.\" \"\nAneglou defied simple labels.  She was a walking list of careers and passions: in addition to her books, she was an actress, director, playwright, composer, singer and dancer.  And if that wasn't enough, she once worked as a madam in a brothel and as the first female and first black street car conductor in San Francisco.\n She was best known for the first of her six memoirs, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings(1970), still widely read in schools.  She described being raped at 7 and becoming an unwed mother at 17.  (Her son, Guy Johnson, a poet and novelist, is her only immediate survivor.) )\nHer formal education ended in high school.  But she was awarded more than 30 honorary degrees from colleges.  She insisted on being called \"Dr. Angelou.\" \"\nIn November 2013, at the age of 85, Angelou stole the show at the National Book Awards in New York when she was presented an award for \"Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community.\" \" She was introduced that night by her friend, author Toni Morrison, who said of Angelou, \"Suffering energized and strengthened her, and her creative impulse struck like bolts of lightning.\" \"\nFrom her wheelchair, Angelou dazzled the crowd by singing a verse of a spiritual: \"When it looked like it wouldn't stop raining, God put a rainbow in the clouds.\" \"\nShe then told the ballroom full of writers, editors and publishers: \"You are the rainbow in my clouds.\" \" To laughter and applause, she added, that \"easy reading is damn hard writing.\" \" In reviewing her career, she said, \"For over 40 years, I have tried to tell the truth as I understand it...  I haven't tried to tell everything I know, but I've tried to tell the truth.\" \"\nIn January 2014, after the death of South African leader Nelson Mandela -- who had read aloud Angelou's poem, Still I Rise, at his 1994 presidential inauguration -- she published His Day Is Done, a poetic tribute to Mandela commissioned by the U.S. State Department.\n It reads in part: \"The news came on the wings of a wind/Reluctant to carry its burden./ /Nelson Mandela's day is done.\" \"\nIn her 2002 memoir, A Song Flung Up to Heaven, Angelou wrote of her friendship with writer James Baldwin: \"Once after we had spent an afternoon talking and drinking with a group of white writers in a downtown bar, he said he liked that I could hold my liquor and my positions.  He was pleased that I could defend Edgar Allan Poe and ask serious questions about Willa Cather.\" \"\nIt was Baldwin who prodded Bob Loomis, an editor at Random House, to prod Angelou to write an autobiography, which she was reluctant to do.\n As Angelou told the story, Loomis called several times before challenging: \"You may be right not to attempt an autobiography because it is nearly impossible to write autobiography as literature.  Almost impossible.\" \"\nAngelou added, \"Jimmy (Baldwin) must have told him to say that, Jimmy would know how I would react to being told, 'You can't .  .  .  '.\n Later, Loomis said of her, \"Maya is her books.\" \"\nShe put it in broader terms: \"I am a writer.  Every writer is his or her books.  Just as every singer is the song, while you're doing it.  The dancer is the dance.\" \"\nShe wrote and delivered a poem at President Clinton's 1993 inaugural.  Her recording of that poem, On the Pulse of Morning, won a Grammy.\n She also had a deal with Hallmark to write short poems and thoughts for greeting cards, pillows and other gift items.  For that, she was lampooned on Saturday Night Live.\n But she shrugged off her critics, as if she has was used to being a target.  \"By the time I was 14, I was 6 feet tall,\" she told USA TODAY.  \"I've never been able to hide.\" \"\nAnd what's wrong, she asked, \"with wanting to put poetry in people's hands, even if they're not going to buy a book?\"\nMany critics and scholars say her prose was better than her poetry, despite its popularity and the large crowds she drew to public readings, which she gave in a strong, mellifluous Southern accent.\n The poem she wrote for the lighting of the White House Christmas Tree in 2005,Amazing Peace, reached No. 12 on USA TODAY's Best-selling Books list.  That's foreign territory for most poetry.\n Even if her poems didn't receive much serious critical attention, they were \"sassy,\" William Sylvester wrote in the 2001 edition of Contemporary Poets.  When \"we hear her poetry, we listen to ourselves.\" \"\nMost of all, she was a survivor.  The best of her writing reminded Yale scholar Harold Bloom of how \"the early black Baptists in America spoke of 'the little me within the big me,' almost the last vestige of the spirituality they carried with them on the Middle Passage from Africa.\" \"\nAngelou's voice, Bloom says, \"speaks to something in the American 'little me within the big me,' white and black and whatever, that can survive dreadful experiences because the deepest self is beyond experience and cannot be violated.\" \"\nHer early childhood was grim.  She was 3 years old when her parents divorced in Long Beach, Calif. Her father sent her and her 4-year-old brother alone by train to live with his mother in segregated Stamps, Ark., \"a town almost that size,\" as Angelou put it.\n At 7, as she later wrote, she went to St. Louis to visit her mother, who was \"too beautiful to have children.\" \" Angelou described how she was first lovingly cuddled, then raped by her mother's boyfriend, \"a breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart.\" \"\nWhen the man was murdered by her uncles, Angelou felt responsible.  She stopped talking to everyone but her brother for five years, even as she came to love stories and poems, reading everyone from Langston Hughes to Charles Dickens.\n Finally, at 12, a teacher got her to speak again.\n In 2008, she told USA TODAY, \"I'm not a writer who teaches.  I'm a teacher who writes.  But I had to work at Wake Forest to know that.\" \"\nShe described the joy she found in a classroom: \"I see all those little faces and big eyes.  Black and white.  They look like sparrows in the nest.  They look up, with their mouths wide open and I try to drop in everything I know.\" \"\nIn 1954, she toured the world in the cast of Porgy and Bess.  In 1960, she and comedian Godfrey Cambridge produced and starred in Cabaret Freedom, a benefit performance for Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  She later served as its Northern coordinator.\n From 1963 to 1966, she taught music and dance at the University of Ghana.  In 1977, she was nominated for an Emmy for her role in Roots, the TV miniseries.\n She also wrote nine children's books, 13 collections of poetry, four collections of essays, adapted I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings for CBS in 1979, narrated the 1996 video, Elmo Saves Christmas, and complied a cookbook in 2004, Hallelujah!  The Welcome Table.\n She dedicated her 1993 essay collection, Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now, to Oprah Winfrey, who hosted grand birthday parties for Angelou.  In 1997, Oprah's Book Club chose Angelou's The Heart of a Woman, the fourth of her memoirs.\n In A Song Flung Up to Heaven, she circled back to the events that led her to begin her first book and dealt with the assassinations of Malcolm X in 1965 and King in 1968.  (She knew them both.) )\nEach of her books \"took on a life of its own,\" she said.  But at the end, she wanted to avoid \"writing about writing.  Unless you're Marcel Proust, that would be dense.\" \"\nShe split her time between a restored 12-room townhouse in Harlem, and a 18-room house in Wake Forest, N.C.\nEven after writing six books about her life, Angelou carefully guarded her privacy.  After two divorces, she would say little about a man she never married, a South African freedom fighter she called \"my great love.\" \"\nIn the early '60s, they lived together in Egypt, where she worked as a journalist.  \"He was the man I felt had taken the heart out of my body and worn it boldly on his shoulder like an epaulette, and I had adored him,\" she wrote, but he goes unnamed inA Song Flung Up to Heaven.\n Angelou said, \"He's dead, I'm sorry to say, but he has children and grandchildren\" who deserve privacy.  \"I know I live in a world that wants to know everything.\" \"\nHer response to that world: \"Make sure what you say is the truth, but don't tell everything you know.\" \"\nOne of her final messages to the public was sent from her Twitter account just four days prior to her death.  It read as follows:\n\"Listen to yourself and in that quitetude you might hear the voice of God.\" \"\nPoet and author Dr. Maya Angelou has died, WFMY reports.  104 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.wltx.com/story/news/2014/05/28/maya-angelou-dies/9662869/",

Her tragic childhood -- she was sexually assaulted at the age of eight by her mother's boyfriend, who was later murdered after she testified against him, and as a result of the trauma Angelou didn't speak for nearly a decade -- is chronicled in Angelou's work, most notably her 1969 autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.  Angelou wrote six additional autobiographies, as well as plays, screenplays, numerous speeches, and countless poems, including \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" which Angelou recited at President Bill Clinton's first inauguration in 1993.\n A full obituary of Angelou is in the works.  In the meantime, take note of the poet's final message, posted to her Twitter account May 23 -- they're appropriately evocative last words:",

She drove a streetcar in San Francisco, was a newspaper editor in Egypt and worked as a cook and a prostitute when she was a destitute single mother.  She wrote television and movie screenplays, performed on the stage as a singer, dancer and actor and released an album of Calypso music.\n But Ms. Angelou will be remembered above all as the \"people's poet,\" a towering public figure and literary icon whose words seem to appear everywhere--spoken at a presidential inauguration, stamped on Hallmark greeting cards and, on the day she died, cascading on Twitter and Facebook as millions commemorated her life and work.\n Ms. Angelou was busy writing and planning public appearances in her final days.  She was scheduled to receive an award in Houston on Friday but canceled her appearance, citing a health emergency.\n Helen Brann, Ms. Angelou's agent of close to 35 years, said the poet was in the middle of writing a new book and was in good spirits when they spoke on Tuesday.\n \"She sounded as she always did.  She sounded vital and interested in her new book, which we were talking about,\" said Ms. Brann.  \"It's a terrific book, a memoir.\" \" The book is unfinished, Ms. Brann said.\n Ms. Angelou published 36 books in her lifetime, including seven autobiographies, volumes of poetry, essay collections, cookbooks and children's books.  She rose to fame in 1969 with the publication of her landmark book, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" which explores her childhood and teenage years and delves into her struggles with rape, racial identity and sexism.  It became a best seller and was nominated for a National Book Award, and remains a staple on many high-school and college curricula.\n Ms. Angelou's literary reputation and global stature are all the more remarkable given the deep setbacks she dealt with as a child and teenager.  Ms. Angelou spent much of her childhood in Stamps, Ark., grappling with poverty and sexual abuse.  In \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" she described being raped by her mother's boyfriend when she was 7, and feeling guilty about the man's death when he was murdered.  She was convinced her voice had killed him, because she had told her brother that the man had assaulted her.  She stopped speaking for five years.\n A teacher introduced her to literature at a formative age, and she fell under the spell of Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe.  She studied dance and drama in high school, but never went to college.  In her 1974 book \"Gather Together in My Name,\" she describes her itinerant, desperate life as a young single mother, when she worked as a prostitute and fry cook to get by.\n She managed to turn her life around, and in the 1950s entered a period of remarkable creativity that would continue for decades.  She studied modern dance and performed as part of a dance team with choreographer Alvin Ailey.  She sang and danced in night clubs and released an album, and adopted the stage name Maya Angelou.\n Ms. Angelou began to focus on writing in the late 1950s, when she moved to New York.  She joined the Harlem Writers Guild and became involved in civil-rights activism and the antiapartheid movement.  In the early 1960s, she lived in Egypt and Ghana, where she worked as an editor and journalist.\n Her writing career took off when a dinner companion, captivated by Ms. Angelou's childhood stories, urged Random House editor Robert Loomis to commission an autobiography from her.  The resulting book was \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nMr. Loomis worked as her editor for more than 40 years.  In a statement released by Random House, Mr. Loomis said, \"Maya, a dear friend, helped change our hearts and minds about the African-American experience in the United States, bringing it to vivid life, and her spirit and energy crossed all borders and deeply affected readers around the world.\" \"\nMs. Angelou stuck to a rigid set of writing rituals.  She liked to write in hotel rooms, and would even rent a room in her hometown when she was writing there.  She wrote stretched out on a bed, with yellow notepads, an ashtray, a deck of cards, a dictionary, a thesaurus and a Bible next to her.  She played solitaire to relax until she was ready to write.  Besides Poe and Shakespeare, her literary influences included Frederick Douglass, Thomas Paine and Matthew Arnold.\n Some of her poetry and essays bordered on philosophy, but at other times, she wielded blunt, plain language.  In her famous poem, \"Still I Rise,\" she wrote: \"Does my sassiness upset you? / Why are you beset with gloom? / 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells / Pumping in my living room.\" \"\nMs. Angelou's passing on Wednesday drew an outpouring of accolades and condolences from artists, entertainers and world leaders.  In a statement delivered by the White House press office, President Barack Obama called Ms. Angelou \"one of the brightest lights of our time--a brilliant writer, a fierce friend and a truly phenomenal woman.\" \" a nod to her \"Phenomenal Woman\" poem.  He noted that his sister Maya was named after Ms. Angelou.  Mr. Obama awarded her with the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian award.\n Former President Bill Clinton, who invited Ms. Angelou to recite a poem at his 1993 presidential inauguration, praised Ms. Angelou's \"wisdom and wit, courage and grace\" in a statement, and added,\" I will always be grateful for her electrifying reading of \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at my first inaugural, and even more for all the years of friendship that followed.\" \"\nNikky Finney, who won the 2011 National Book Award for poetry and currently teaches at the University of South Carolina, called Ms. Angelou \"a mountain of a human being.\" \"\n\"I grew up a young poet in South Carolina looking for light in the sky, looking for poets, especially black women writers who were doing what I wanted to do with my life.  And Dr. Angelou was one of the brightest lights that was out there for me,\" said.  Ms. Finney, age 56.  \"Hers was a story for us all.  She was proudly African American but she was passionately human.\" \"\nLater in her career, Ms. Angelou struck a deal with Hallmark to write greeting cards.  At the time, some criticized her for becoming overly commercial.  Ms. Angelou shrugged off the criticism and said that she saw the project as a way to reach a wider audience.  She added that the enterprise was perfectly in keeping with her role as \"the people's poet.\" \"\nIn recent years, she had embraced social media as a way to communicate with fans.  She began using Twitter in 2010, and in a tweet on Friday, her last, she urged readers toward quiet reflection: \"Listen to yourself and in that quietude you might hear the voice of God.\" \"\nMs. Angelou is survived by her son, Guy B.

She was 86.\n Born Marguerite Annie Johnson, Angelou was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and grew up in Arkansas.  She changed her name to Maya Angelou in 1952 when she wed a Greek sailor Anastasios Angelopulos.\n Angelou was perhaps best known for her 1969 memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, which follows her early struggles with racism, sexual assault, and her quest to establish her identity.\n She spent much of the '60s living in Egypt and Ghana, working as a freelance writer and editor.  When she returned to the U.S., she wrote I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, which became the first nonfiction best seller by an African American woman.\n Angelou penned seven autobiographies and five collections of essays throughout her life, and she was a prolific poet, playwright, and public speaker.\n Speaking to Parade.com in 2012, Angelou shared her secret to her continued energy, even in her 80s.\n \"I'm very blessed.  I'm grateful.  I continue to have an attitude of gratitude,\" she said.  \"The first thing I do in the morning when I awaken is say, 'Thank you, Lord!' I'm grateful to be alive, and I'm going to try to tell the truth as well as I know and tell it as eloquently as I can so that people can hear it.\" \"\nShe added it was a \"blessing\" to know she was an inspiration to so many.\n \"I'm grateful to be of use,\" she said.  \"I will not be misused or abused, but I will be of use to anybody.\" \"",

                    "body": "She established her literary reputation in 1970 with \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" a memoir detailing the racism and abuse she endured during her harrowing childhood.\n From her desperate early years, Ms. Angelou gradually moved into nightclub dancing and from there began a career in the arts that spanned more than 60 years.  She sang cabaret and calypso, danced with Alvin Ailey, acted on Broadway, directed for film and television and wrote more than 30 books, including poetry, essays and, responding to the public's appetite for her life story, six autobiographies.\n She won three Grammy Awards for spoken-word recordings of her poetry and prose and was invited by President-elect Bill Clinton to read an original poem at his first inauguration in 1993, making her only the second poet in history, after Robert Frost, to be so honored.\n Her poem, \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" spoke of a hope that the country's diverse people would find new unity after chapters in American history of oppression and division.\n \"Lift up your eyes upon/The day breaking for you,\" she said as the nation watched.  \"Give birth again/To the dream.\" \"\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.\n It was her story of personal transformation in \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" that launched Ms. Angelou's career and brought her wide recognition as a symbol of strength overcoming struggle.\n \"She brought an understanding of the dilemmas and dangers and exhilarations of black womanhood more to the fore than almost any autobiographer before her time,\" said Arnold Rampersad, a literary critic and professor emeritus of English at Stanford University.  \"She challenged assumptions about what was possible for a poor black girl from the South, and she emerged as a figure of courage, honesty and grace.\" \"\nThe idea for \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" arose during conversations with friends, including James Baldwin, whom she'd met in Paris.  Ms. Angelou initially resisted the suggestion that she write her story, giving in only after an editor goaded her by suggesting that writing autobiography as literature was too difficult for anyone to do well.\n \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" focused on growing up in her grandmother's care in segregated Stamps, Ark., and on her rape by her mother's boyfriend at age 7, \"a breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart.\" \"\nAfter she spoke her attacker's name, he was found kicked to death in a lot behind a slaughterhouse.  Convinced that her voice had the power to kill, she fell nearly silent for nearly five years.  She spoke only to her beloved older brother, Bailey.\n \"I had to stop talking,\" she wrote.  \"I walked into rooms where people were laughing, their voices hitting the walls like stones, and I simply stood still -- in the midst of a riot of sound.  After a minute or two, silence would rush into the room from its hiding place because I had eaten up all the sounds.\" \"\nThe book, which came at the leading edge of a renaissance in literature by black female writers such as Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, traces the young Ms. Angelou's effort to recover her voice and a sense of control over her body and her life, beginning with her recitation of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" at the behest of a family friend.\n Enduringly popular, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" has been translated into 17 languages, sold more than one million copies and still appears on high school and college reading lists.\n \"There isn't any easy, which is to say false line in the book,\" wrote the novelist Ward Just in a Washington Post review.  \"It is not propaganda nor a history of the blacks, nor, most blessedly, sociology.  It is one woman, Maya Angelou, writing about her life and times and writing from a talent so strong as to make each part of it immediate, direct, devastating and -- oddly -- beautiful.\" \"\nMs. Angelou produced five subsequent autobiographical volumes, avoiding distractions during her writing days by retreating to hotel rooms, where she removed art from the walls.  She often arrived before dawn -- dictionary, thesaurus and bottle of dry sherry in tow -- and wrote longhand on yellow legal pads.\n None of her poetry or prose brought the same acclaim as \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" but critics praised her ability to weave street talk with literary references and the rhythm of church hymns.  But in some sense, Ms. Angelou existed in a realm untouched by criticism.  She developed a devoted group of readers who adored her and were drawn to her poems, which featured accessible rhymes and themes of cultivating love, conquering injustice and speaking out of silence.\n \"You may write me down in history/With your bitter, twisted lies,\" reads a poem in her 1978 collection, \"And Still I Rise.\" \" \"You may trod me in the very dirt/But still, like dust, I'll rise.\" \"\nIn 2002, she lent her name and verse to a line of Hallmark greeting cards, table runners and other products.  \"I want my work read,\" she told The Washington Post at the time.\n Her ability to reach a mass audience, including people who didn't consider themselves poetry readers, set her apart.  A fixture on the lecture circuit and popular guest on Oprah Winfrey's talk show, her personal story became a platform for her message of renewal and hope.\n \"If God put the rainbows right in the clouds themselves, each one of us in the direst and dullest and most dreaded and dreary moments can see a possibility of hope,\" she said in a speech at a conference at Weber State University in 1997.  \"Each one of us has the chance to be a rainbow in somebody's cloud.\" \"\nMaya Angelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis to Bailey Johnson, a dietitian, and Vivian Johnson, a card dealer and boardinghouse proprietor.  Her parents divorced when she was 3, and they sent her to Arkansas with her brother Bailey -- \"the greatest person in my world,\" she wrote, who called her \"My,\" \"Mine,\" and finally \"Maya.\" \"\nIn 1940, she and Bailey moved to California to live with their mother.  Ms. Angelou, who had discovered Shakespeare (\"my first white love\") as a child in Stamps, graduated from Mission High School in San Francisco and took evening drama and dance classes.  Concerned she might be a lesbian and wanting to prove she was \"normal,\" she propositioned a young man who lived up the street.  After that one encounter, she became pregnant at age 16 with Clyde \"Guy\" Johnson, her only child.\n She spent the next several years bouncing between jobs, scraping by first as a streetcar conductor and cook who read the Russians -- Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov -- in her free time.  She said she also fell in love with a man who worked as a pimp, which led her to prostitution and then a stint as a madam.\n She tried to join the Women's Army Corps but was rejected because the California Labor School, where she had taken dance classes, appeared on the House Un-American Activities Committee list of organizations with communist sympathies.  Ever more desperate, she sold stolen clothes and flirted with drugs until a friend of hers, a heroin addict, forced her to watch him shoot up.\n \"He slouched, nodding, his mouth open and the saliva sliding down his chin as slowly as the blood had flowed down his arm,\" she wrote in \"Gather Together in My Name\" (1974), the second volume of her autobiography.  It was a turning point -- the underworld revealed.  \"I had walked the precipice and seen it all; and at the critical moment, one man's generosity pushed me safely away from the edge.\" \"\nIn the early 1950s, she married Tosh Angelos, a Greek American sailor.  They divorced several years later, but it was during their marriage that she landed a dancing and singing gig at San Francisco's famed Purple Onion nightclub and first used the name Angelou -- a version of Angelos.\n In the mid-1950s, she toured 22 countries in Europe and Africa with a State Department production of the Gershwin folk opera \"Porgy and Bess,\" acted off-Broadway and released her first album of songs, \"Miss Calypso.\" \" She chronicled this blossoming of her performance career in \"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas\" (1976), the third volume of her autobiography.\n Ms. Angelou's interest in writing grew from song lyrics to short stories, and, with the encouragement of John Oliver Killens, a friend and black novelist, she moved to New York City in 1959 to join the Harlem Writers Guild.  Members of the Guild critiqued her writing and offered advice: \"Write each sentence over and over again,\" she recalled in \"Heart of a Woman\" (1981) the fourth installment of her autobiography, \"until it seems you've used every combination possible, then write it again.\" \"\nIn New York, Ms. Angelou was exposed to civil-rights leaders, among them Bayard Rustin of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  She helped organize and performed in the \"Cabaret for Freedom,\" an off-Broadway musical revenue and benefit for that organization, and performed in Jean Genet's \"The Blacks,\" also off-Broadway, about everyday confrontations between whites and blacks.  In 1960, Ms. Angelou replaced Rustin as the northern coordinator for the conference.\n She married a South African civil-rights activist, Vusumzi Make, and they moved to Cairo, where she worked as an editor at an English-language newsweekly.  The couple divorced soon after, but Ms. Angelou stayed in Africa with her son, working as a teacher and writer in Ghana.\n The West African country had won its independence from England five years earlier, in 1957, and its Pan-Africanist President, Kwame Nkrumah, invited African Americans to move there.  Ms. Angelou became part of a group of black intellectuals who answered that call.\n \"We knew that we were mostly unwanted in the land of our birth and saw promise on our ancestral continent,\" she wrote in \"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes\" (1986), her fifth autobiography.\n Soon after returning to California in 1966, she wrote \"Black, Blues, Black,\" a 10-part television series about the role of African culture in America, and served as a lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles.  She chronicled this period, including the assassinations of King and Malcolm X, in \"A Song Flung Up to Heaven\" (2002), her final installment of her memoir and one that comes full circle, ending as a younger Ms. Angelou sits down to write the first lines of \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nAfter the critical and commercial success of \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" Ms. Angelou published her first volume of poetry in 1971, \"Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie.\" \" The following year, she wrote the screenplay for the film \"Georgia, Georgia,\" about a black woman (played by Diana Sands) murdered for taking a white photographer as a lover.\n In 1973, Ms. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a carpenter, and they lived together in Berkeley, Calif., until their divorce eight years later.\n \"I have lost good men -- or men I might have been able to turn into good men -- because I have no middle passage,\" she told People in 1982.  \"I know that I'm not the easiest person to live with.\" \"\nDu Feu was remodeling homes while Ms. Angelou wrote, directed for film and television, and acted.  She was nominated for a Tony Award for her Broadway performance in \"Look Away\" (1973), a two-woman play about the friendship between first lady Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Geraldine Page) and Ms. Angelou's character, Elizabeth Keckley.  In the TV series \"Roots\" (1977), she played Kunta Kinte's grandmother.\n In 1981, Ms. Angelou was appointed a lifetime member of the faculty at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem.  She continued to write, including cookbooks and children's books.  In her many public speaking obligations, often at college commencements, she presented herself as a wise elder whose life was evidence of how far it is possible to travel.\n \"See me now, black, female, American and Southern,\" she said in a 1990 speech to students at Centenary College in Louisiana.  \"See me and see yourselves.  What can't you do?\"\nThe Post's 1970 review of \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\"\nAngelou: \"I will have been as present as possible, and as courageous as possible...\"\nAngelou: \"I was black, 16 and had the nerve to want the job.\" \"\nMaya Angelou honored by the National Portrait Gallery",

                    "body": "Maya Angelou, the poet and professor whose bestselling memoirs of growing up black and female made her a beloved American storyteller, with a melodious voice and seemingly boundless optimism in the face of hardship, has died.  She was 86.\n She died today at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, according to her literary agent, Helen Brann.\n From a timid young girl, traumatized by racial discrimination and sexual abuse, Angelou blossomed into one of the nation's most incisive writers and powerful speakers.  Over the years she was nominated for a National Book Award for her childhood memoir and a Tony Award for her stage acting, while winning three Grammy Awards for spoken-word albums.\n Her frequent lectures, appearances on Oprah Winfrey's television show and poetry reading at Bill Clinton's first presidential inaugural made her one of America's best-known literary figures.\n \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" (1970), the first of her six-volume autobiography, sold more than 1 million copies, was translated into 17 languages and spent two years on the New York Times paperback bestseller list.  It elevated the once-struggling writer to international literary celebrity.\n The memoir recounts Angelou's upbringing in the segregated Deep South, her life's formative trauma -- the rape she endured at 7 by her mother's boyfriend -- and the six-year period of near-total muteness into which she retreated.\n 'Tripartite Crossfire'\n\"The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power,\" Angelou wrote.  \"The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste and even belligerence.\" \"\nFor Angelou, travels in the 1950s and 1960s to Europe and Africa as an aspiring artist opened the world.  She learned five languages and became fascinated with the complexity of humanity, particularly femininity.\n Back in the U.S. in 1968, she was writing and producing a 10-part series on African-American culture for public television, and mourning the murder of Martin Luther King Jr., when she was contacted by Robert Loomis, an editor at Random House who had heard from mutual friends about Angelou's skills and life story.  He urged her to write a book and overcame her initial reluctance with a challenge, saying it was close to impossible to write an autobiography as literature.\n First Book\nAngelou took the bait and got to work on what would become \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nHer follow-up was another hit, a volume of poetry, \"Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie'' (1971).\n Over the next 30-plus years she filled out the six-part autobiography of her early life.  The final volume, ''A Song Flung Up to Heaven'' (2002), ends with her picking up a ballpoint pen to start work on the memoirs, ready to ''examine the quality in the human spirit that continues to rise despite the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.' ''\nAngelou, who called herself ''a teacher who writes'' rather than vice versa, became a professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston Salem, North Carolina, in 1981.\n In 1993, she became the second poet -- after Robert Frost, in 1961 -- to speak at the inauguration of a U.S. president.  She recited a new work, ''On the Pulse of the Morning,'' about a dividing nation coming together, for Clinton's swearing-in ceremony.\n Grandmother's Legacy\n''History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again,\" she read before an ocean of people in Washington.  \"Lift up your eyes upon the day breaking for you.\" \"\nAngelou said determination, courage and optimism were among the many traits she learned from living with her paternal grandmother in Arkansas as a young girl.\n \"You'll never hear me complain.  I will protest, but I will not complain,\" she said in a January 2009 interview with Bloomberg News.  \"Bitterness is like cancer.  It eats up the host.\" \"\n\"But anger is like fire,\" she said.  \"It can burn the dross out and leave materials in the ashes from which things can grow.\" \"\nBirth of 'Maya'\nMarguerite Annie Johnson was born on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis to Bailey Johnson, a doorman who later became a U.S. Navy cook, and the former Vivian Baxter, who emerges in her daughter's writings as glamorous, brave and interested in so many things that motherhood at times was more burden than blessing.\n Her parents divorced when Angelou was 3.  She and her older brother, Bailey Jr. -- who nicknamed her Maya -- went to live in Stamps, Arkansas, with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson, the town's first black store owner, who would exert a strong influence on her granddaughter.\n At 7, Angelou was visiting her mother in Chicago when her mother's boyfriend raped her.  She divulged to her brother the identity of her assailant, who was tried and convicted, then released and, soon after, found beaten to death -- perhaps by her mother's relatives, though nobody ever was charged.\n \"I thought my voice was so powerful it had killed that man,\" Angelou said in the Bloomberg interview.  \"And obviously if I spoke, my voice could just kill people.  So it would be better not to speak.\" \"\nGoing Mute\nOver the next six years, she broke her self-imposed silence only on occasion, and only to her brother.  Her muteness made her absorb the words of others.\n \"For a long time I would think of myself, my whole body, as an ear,\" she told the New York Times.  Out of ideas, her mother's family sent her back to Arkansas, where her beloved grandmother once again comforted and encouraged her.\n She spoke again at 13 after she and her brother moved to San Francisco to live with their mother, who had become owner of a hotel and nightclub.  After attending Mission High School, Angelou received a scholarship to study dance and drama at San Francisco's Labor School.  She dropped out when she was 14 and became the city's first black female cable car conductor.\n She eventually returned to high school and graduated at 17, eight months pregnant after what she described as a \"brief loveless embrace with a teenage boy that lasted only minutes.\" \" Her son, Clyde, known as Guy, would be her only child and a lifelong source of joy.  For money, Angelou worked a series of jobs, including as a madam for prostitutes and, briefly, a prostitute herself.\n Adopted Surname\nAt 21 she married a Greek-American aspiring musician, Tosh Angelos, and adopted the name \"Angelou\" after they divorced three years later.\n Pursuing dance, then singing, she performed with a young Alvin Ailey and toured Europe and the Middle East with a production of \"Porgy and Bess.\" \"\nShe settled with her son in New York City in 1959 and began to pursue writing at the Harlem Writers Guild, focusing on poetry and plays.\n With her boyfriend, Vusumzi Make, a South African civil rights activist whom she met in New York, Angelou moved with her son in 1960 to Cairo, where she worked as editor of an English language weekly.  They settled the following year in Ghana, where Angelou surrounded herself with other African-American expatriates, befriended Malcolm X, worked as feature editor for \"The African Review\" and wrote for \"The Ghanaian Times.\" \"\n'Filled With Pride'\nShe returned to the U.S. in 1965 ready to delve into the civil-rights movement as coordinator of Malcolm X's new Organization of Afro-American Unity.  Days after her return, Malcolm X was assassinated.\n Angelou would advocate racial equality throughout her life.  After Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, she said in a CBS interview, \"I'm so filled with pride for my country.  What do you say?  We are growing up.\" \"\nAngelou's script for the 1972 film \"Georgia, Georgia\" portrayed black women as doubly alone, ill-served not just by the whites who mistreat them but by the black men who ignore them.\n \"I am a woman who is black and lonely,\" she said in a 1972 interview with the New York Times.\n Her second marriage, in 1973, was to Paul du Feu, a British-born carpenter who a year earlier had become the first male centerfold of Cosmopolitan magazine.  That marriage ended in divorce after seven years.\n Angelou's triumph as a writer overshadowed her successes as a performer.  She was nominated for a Tony Award for her Broadway debut in \"Look Away\" (1973).  She appeared in Alex Haley's celebrated television mini-series \"Roots\" (1977), playing the grandmother of the slave Kunta Kinte.  She directed a feature film, \"Down in the Delta\" (1998).\n Her Grammy awards for spoken-word albums came in 1993, for \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" in 1995, for \"Phenomenal Woman: Poems Celebrating Women,\" and in 2002, for \"A Song Flung Up to Heaven.\" \"",

But she also wrote plays, screenplays and television scripts.\n She was an introspective person, who sometimes holed up in a hotel room with a deck of cards to play solitaire as she wrote.  But Angelou was also a born entertainer who loved a crowd and recorded calypso songs, sang, danced and acted.\n Angelou's tale of struggle, survival and triumph resonated with readers.  In all of her work, she emphasized the commonality of human experience.\n \"Human beings are more alike than we are unalike,\" Angelou was fond of saying.\n Angelou proved that saying.  Over the years, she appeared local and national stages with a wide range of notables, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.\n Angelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson on April 4, 1928.  Her older brother Bailey gave her the nickname Maya.  She adopted the last name of Angelou during the early 1950s when she began performing as a dancer and singer.  The name was a variation on her first husband's, Tosh Angelos', surname.\n Angelou first found fame with her autobiography, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \" The book was published in 1969, and was nominated for the National Book Award.",

It was also nominated for a National Book Award.\n The poignant, literary autobiography that brought Angelou fame addressed racism, rape and forging a strong and dignified identity in the midst of overcoming trauma.  Against the backdrop of the civil rights movement, the book was embraced for telling a story of the collective experience of African-Americans, particularly in the South.  It also inspired women healing from trauma, abuse and isolation.\n Angelou wrote six, additional autobiographical books and collections of poetry, including poetry collections included 1978's And Still I Rise, 1990's I Shall Not Be Moved, and 1995's Phenomenal Women.\n Angelou also previously pursued singing, dancing and acting, including in the 1969 television series she produced, \"Black, Blues, Black,\" which explored African traditions in American life.\n Her screenplay Georgia, Georgia was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1972, and she received a Tony award in 1973, for her performance in Look Away.

Her 1969 memoir, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, told the story of the early years of her life, ending when she gave birth at the age of 16.

Her grandmother was relatively well-off, but the family was subject to casual racism and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan.

She passed away Wednesday, May 28, 2014 at her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina at the age of 86.\n \"Her family is extremely grateful that her ascension was not belabored by a loss of acuity or comprehension,\" her only child, Clyde \"Guy\" Johnson, said in a statement.  \"She lived a life as a teacher, activist, artist and human being.  She was a warrior for equality, tolerance and peace.\" \"\nAngelou, a St. Louis native, recently canceled a series of public appearances due to \"an unexpected illness.\" \"\n\"Today, Michelle and I join millions around the world in remembering one of the brightest lights of our time - a brilliant writer, a fierce friend and a truly phenomenal woman,\" President Barack Obama said in a statement.\n Obama presented Angelou with the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2011.\n Eugene B. Redmond, East St. Louis poet laureate, spoke to his longtime friend a few days ago.  \"She was laughing and giggling and working out the time I was coming this summer,\" said Redmond.\n It would have been the 14th consecutive summer he spent in Angelou's guest house on Valley Road in Winston-Salem, working on poems.  Redmond has written and published more poems about Angelou than he could count.  Angelou is a trustee of his internationally renowned Eugene B. Redmond (commonly referred to as EBR) Writers Club.\n \"She feeds eyes, ears & skies with / dancing loaves of poetry,\" Redmond writes of her in one poem.\n Poetry was only part of her gift.\n \"Over the course of her remarkable life, Maya was many things - an author, poet, civil rights activist, playwright, actress, director, composer, singer and dancer,\" Obama said.\n \"She won three Grammys, spoke six languages and was the second poet in history to recite a poem at a presidential inauguration,\" her longtime friend Oprah Winfrey said in a statement.\n Even as a writer, Angelou knew few bounds.\n \"Who else won Grammys for spoken word, was nominated for a Pulitzer for poetry, received a National Book Award for lifetime achievement (where Toni Morrison gave the intro) and had a book ('I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings') made into a movie?\" Redmond said.\n \"Who else, outside of Langston Hughes and maybe Amiri Baraka, has written in every genre?  Who else excelled in poetry, fiction, autobiography, songwriting, lyrics, books for ballet?  She excelled in every genre, and then she created some hybrid forms.\" \"\nShe even published cookbooks.  The lively atmosphere and adventurous menu served at her table is captured in Redmond's poem \"Maya's Kitchen: Homage to SisterCook.  \"Smothered blues from a delta skillet - black,\" Redmond writes.  \"Spicy proverbs from a rush of pepper soup.\" \"\nSt. Louis poet and author Quincy Troupe, whose friendship with Angelou dated back 40 years, said her achievement was greatest in autobiography and performance.\n \"I liked her as a person, as a personality and especially as a stage presence,\" Troupe said.  \"She could really deliver the goods.  It was remarkable how she could move an audience.\" \"\nGerald Early, a professor at Washington University and fellow author in multiple genres, agreed with Troupe's assessment.  He recalled introducing her at a campus event in St. Louis when he was still an unknown junior professor.  \"She gave a fantastic presentation,\" Early said, \"combining her literary and theatrical skills seamlessly.\" \"\nBut on the page, Early said, she was strongest as a memoirist.\n \"'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' will always be one of the great African-American autobiographies ever written, one of the great American autobiographies,\" Early said.\n Perhaps it is most remarkable that one human being - emerging from an oppressed people - could encompass so many gifts and use them for so long to touch so many other people.\n \"Maya Angelou met, knew, encountered, cooperated and collaborated with, opposed - almost always with aplomb and dignity - represented, intimately probed, sometimes dissected, sometimes corrected, sometimes used, every one of the classic black masks,\" the St. Louis poet K. Curtis Lyle said.\n \"She was able to accomplish this admirable feat of human complexity and visionary clarity by incorporating into her being, quite early, what the Yoruba call Ashe, or the ability to make things happen.\" \"\n\"She evolved into a global voice,\" said St. Louis poet Shirley Bradley LeFlore, \"springing from a wellspring of black experience.  I think about how she used that to connect most of us in the world.\" \"\n\"What stands out to me most about Maya Angelou is not what she has done or written or spoken, it's how she lived her life,\" Winfrey said.  \"She moved through the world with unshakeable calm, confidence and a fierce grace.\" \"\nCaged bird singing\nMaya Angelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson to Bailey Johnson and Vivian Johnson in St. Louis on April 4, 1928, though she was raised by her grandmother in the small town of Stamps, Arkansas.\n Her breakthrough book, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" (1970), focusses on growing up in a small segregated Arkansas town.  The worst abuse she suffered, however, came from her mother's boyfriend, who raped her at age 7.  After she spoke the rapist's name, he was found kicked to death.  Awed by the power of her own voice, she writes, she fell silent for nearly five years, speaking only to one brother.\n The book - which has been translated into 17 languages and sold more than one million copies - alone would have guaranteed her literary immortality.\n \"She was one of the few writers, black or white or anything else, who had both a huge popular audience (every African American I know loves her work) but also was respected by the literati for her autobiographies, particularly 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'\" Early said.\n She adopted the stage name \"Angelou\" in the early 1950s when she was married to Tosh Angelos, a Greek American sailor, and dancing professionally at San Francisco's Purple Onion nightclub.  Her singing and dancing career is described in her third memoir, \"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas\" (1976).\n In the first half of the 1960s, she was a civil rights activist and aspiring writer in New York.  She spent the second half of the sixties living in Africa, after marrying a South African activist, experiences described in her fifth autobiography, \"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes\" (1986).  In Ghana she roomed for a time with a fellow St. Louis native, Alice Windom.\n U.S. Rep.  Wm.  Lacy Clay points out that she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 1992, a year before she read a poem at Bill Clinton's first inauguration - becoming only the second poet in history, after Robert Frost, to do so.\n In keeping with her embrace of both high and popular culture, in 2002 she lent her name and verse to a line of Hallmark products.  \"I want my work read,\" she told The Washington Post at the time.\n Throughout all of these evolutions - and this is a very partial summary - she retained close connection to Redmond and Troupe, two St. Louis-area poets from opposite sides of the Mississippi River.  In both cases, it was a family affair.\n In 1970, the year her life began to change forever with the publication of her first best-selling memoir, Angelou told Redmond, \"Be my brother forever.\" \"\n\"The way she danced, serpentine, with Haitian movements, and then a snap of her neck like black women do, and she'd pop her finger and say, 'Be my brother forever,'\" Redmond remembered.\n \"'Be my brother forever' - back then, that meant something.  Every two weeks, I'd give an elegiac poem for someone who had fallen in battle, often under suspicious circumstances.  In my heart, in my gut, I knew what she meant: 'We're here fighting.  I got you, and you got me.' '\"\nIn Troupe's case, with a different twist of fate they might have been actual blood brother and sister.\n \"I saw Maya in San Francisco and she took me to meet her mother.  She said her mother had something to tell me.

That kind of bonded Maya and me.  We could have been brother and sister in a real sense.\" \"\nLater, in 1987, Troupe had the extreme honor of serving with Angelou (and Toni Morrison) as an honorary pallbearer in the funeral service of the great author James Baldwin in New York City.\n Redmond and Troupe are joined by millions of people all over the world from all walks of life mourning Maya Angelou.\n \"I've been blessed to have Maya Angelou as my mentor, mother/sister and friend since my 20s.  She was there for me always, guiding me through some of the most important years of my life,\" Winfrey said.  \"I loved her and I know she loved me.  I will profoundly miss her.  She will always be the rainbow in my clouds.\" \"",

                    "body": "Author and poet Maya Angelou died Wednesday at 86.  But when you read her poems, you can still hear her rich, deep voice caressing every syllable:\n\"She was an extraordinary, charismatic person,\" Edwin Wilson, a former provost and English professor at Wake Forest University where Angelou taught, told the Observer.  \"She had a way of bringing an audience very much to within her grasp.\" \"\nAfter Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he asked her to read a poem at his inauguration, the first poem at an inauguration in 32 years.\n She called it \"On the Pulse of the Morning,\" and in it she spoke of hope for the country's future, but also reminded listeners of two despairs from the past: the Trail of Tears and slavery.\n Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St. Louis.  She was raised by her paternal grandmother in Stamps, Ark. --- \"swollen-belly poor,\" she described it.  At 16, she had her only child, son Guy Johnson.  She married and divorced at least two times, but would never say how many.\n She was a poet, dancer, actress, songwriter, civil rights activist, streetcar conductor, Creole cook, cocktail waitress, filmmaker, script writer.  While touring as an entertainer in Europe and Africa in the 1950s, she assumed the name Maya Angelou.\n First book\nIn 1969, she emerged as an author.  Her first book, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" was a critical and commercial success.  In it, she described being raped at age 7 by her mother's boyfriend.\n \"I had to make a decision that I would tell a truth which might liberate me, and might liberate others,\" she once told the Observer.  \"I have a file in my office filled with letters from women and men, mostly women, who read 'Caged Bird' and somehow felt liberated enough to tell their mothers, or to confront their fathers or their uncles or their brothers, as grown women, and to say, 'This was cruel, what you did to me.' ' \"\nShe dedicated the book to her son and \"all the strong black birds of promise who defy the odds and gods and sing their songs.\" \"\nFor six years after the rape, Angelou said, she rarely spoke, and only to her brother.  That experience nurtured the writer in her.\n \"I spent six years as a mute,\" she told The Atlanta-Journal Constitution in 2002, \"and so I had read everything.\" \" And I had memorized.  I memorized 60 sonnets.  And I memorized Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Welden Johnson, Countee Cullen and Edgar Allan Poe.  I loved Poe so much I called him 'Eap' to myself.\" \"\n'Maya who?'\nEarly in her writing career, she began renting hotel rooms where she would write.  She would take a yellow pad, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a Bible and a bottle of sherry.\n \"I'm very fortunate, here in my town, to have a hotel which I use,\" she told the Observer, referring to Winston-Salem.  \"And everyone there, from the clerks, the counter people, the reservations people, the maids and the janitors and so forth, everyone says they don't know me.\n \"People call or come by and say, 'Is this the place where Maya Angelou is?  And they say, 'Maya who?' \"\nAngelou moved to Winston-Salem in 1981 after being given a lifetime position as the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University.\n \"Not only was she a strong and active member of the faculty,\" said Wilson, the former provost.  \"She brought to the campus other people of distinction, especially African Americans.  That added a kind of special strength and diversity to the Wake Forest community.\" \"\nAngelou found herself at the center of controversy in December 2001 after she partnered with Hallmark Cards on a line of greeting cards and other products.\n \"I think it's preposterous,\" said Billy Collins, then poet laureate of the United States.  \"It lowers the understanding of what poetry actually can do.\" \"\nAngelou said she saw it as a literary challenge: to distill an inspiration into two sentences.  \"I have not reduced my value or respect for words or love of the language,\" she told the St. Louis Post Dispatch.  \"I have accepted the challenge to say what I mean succinctly and I'm having a ball.  It was exactly what I needed after 'A Song Flung up to Heaven.' ' \"\n\"A Song Flung up to Heaven\" was the sixth volume of her autobiography, published in 2002 and including memories of motherhood, as well as the assassinations in the 1960s of her friends Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\nThe last sentence of that volume is the same as the first sentence of the first:\n\"What are you looking at me for?\" she wrote.  \"I didn't come to stay.\" \"\n\"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas\"",

                    "body": "Amy Wong looks back on the life of a truly remarkable poet and writer\nI first encountered Maya Angelou during Sixth Form when I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, her first autobiography, was recommended to me by my English teacher.  It wasn't always an easy read - Angelou's descriptions of the trials she faced whilst growing up were extremely harrowing.  However, the book was also filled with Angelou's characteristic self-deprecating humour, and most importantly, it was always immensely relatable.  Few writers are able to achieve the type of connection with their readers that she immediately established but Angelou's authenticity meant she perfectly captured the self-doubt and uncertainty that every girl experiences as they grow up.  The world has suffered a great loss today as it was announced she has died aged 86.\n To say Angelou didn't have the easiest of lives would be an understatement.  She was raped by her mother's boyfriend as a young child, which led to her refusing to speak for five years after he was murdered following his release from prison.  Angelou also became pregnant when she was a teenager and suffered racial discrimination.  \"There was so much ignorance afoot in the South,\" she told the BBC in 2003.\n However, Angelou never let adversity wear her down, and it was this resilience that made her so admirable.  \"There is a kind of strength that is almost frightening in black women,\" she once said.  \"It's as if a steel rod runs right through the head down to the feet.\" \"\nAlthough she was best known for her autobiographies, Angelou was also a successful Pulitzer Prize nominated poet.  In 1993, she was chosen to recite On the Pulse of Morning at Bill Clinton's inauguration.  It wasn't surprising to learn she once worked as a Calypso singer and dancer; The Lesson and The Mothering Darkness clearly demonstrate her expert command of rhythm.  All of her poetry possesses a powerful vibrancy and intensity - \"Does my sassiness offend you?\" she challenged the reader in the wonderfully unapologetic and defiant Still I Rise.\n Angelou was dubbed \"the black woman's poet laureate\" by critic Elsie B.Washington and was a keen civil rights activist.  However, her work does not just speak to black people and she herself famously reminded the world that \"human beings are more alike than we are unlike\".  The fact that her work has been translated into more than 17 languages is proof of this.\n Angelou inspired people to have confidence in themselves and take control of their lives instead letting others define their identity.  \"We may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them,\" she wrote in Letter to My Daughter.\n Angelou will always be remembered for instilling courage in the hearts of millions - and that is what makes her a Phenomenal Woman.",

They knew about her work, those young people, and it was pretty cool,\" Thorns said.\n Thorns, special assistant to the university president for diversity, said Angelou's visit to the campus attracted more than 4,000 people that day.  It's a day many will never forget.\n Angelou, who died on Wednesday, published seven autobiographies and was an active voice during the Civil Rights Movement.  Angelou was also only the second poet to speak at a presidential inauguration.  She read the poem On the Pulse of the Morning when Bill Clinton was inaugurated in 1993.\n \"To know where she came from and all the obstacles, she didn't let it define her,\" Thorns said.",

When we asked her what she did, what her job was, she walked us to Oakland's Seventh Street, where dusty bars and smoke shops sat in the laps of storefront churches.  She pointed out Raincoat's Pinochle Parlor and Slim Jenkins' pretentious saloon.  Some nights she played pinochle for money or ran a poker game at Mother Smith's or stopped at Slim's for a few drinks.  She told us that she never cheated anybody and wasn't making any preparations to do so.  Her work was as honest as the job held by fat Mrs. Walker (a maid), who lived next door to us, \"and a damn sight better paid.' '' She wouldn't bust suds for anybody nor be anyone's kitchen bitch.  The good Lord gave her a mind and she intended to use it to support her mother and her children.  She didn't need to add \"And have a little fun along the way.' ''\nAuthor and poet Maya Angelou has died, Wake Forest University confirmed Wednesday.  She was 86.\n But when you read her poems, you can still hear her rich, deep voice caressing every syllable:\n\"She was an extraordinary, charismatic person,\" Edwin Wilson, a former provost at Wake Forest University where Angelou taught, told the Observer years ago.  \"She had a way of bringing an audience very much to within her grasp.\" \"\nAfter Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he asked her to read a poem at his inauguration, the first poem at an inauguration in 32 years.\n She called it \"On the Pulse of the Morning,\" and in it she spoke of hope for the country's future, but also reminded listeners of two despairs from the past: the Trail of Tears and slavery.\n Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St. Louis.  She was raised by her paternal grandmother in Stamps, Ark. - \"swollen-belly poor,'' she described it.  At 16, she had her only child, son Guy Johnson.  She married and divorced at least two times, but would never say how many.\n She was a poet, dancer, actress, songwriter, civil rights activist, streetcar conductor, Creole cook, cocktail waitress, filmmaker, script writer.  While touring as an entertainer in Europe and Africa in the 1950s, she assumed the name Maya Angelou.\n First book\nIn 1969, she emerged as an author.  Her first book, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" was a critical and commercial success.  In it, she described being raped at age 7 by her mother's boyfriend.\n \"I had to make a decision that I would tell a truth which might liberate me, and might liberate others,'' she told the Observer in 1994.  \"I have a file in my office filled with letters from women and men, mostly women, who read 'Caged Bird' and somehow felt liberated enough to tell their mothers, or to confront their fathers or their uncles or their brothers, as grown women, and to say, 'This was cruel, what you did to me.' ' \"\nShe dedicated the book to her son, Guy Johnson, and \"all the strong black birds of promise who defy the odds and gods and sing their songs.\" \"\nFor six years after the rape, Angelou said, she rarely spoke, and only to her brother.  That experience nurtured the writer in her.\n \"I spent six years as a mute,'' she told The Atlanta-Journal Constitution in 2002, ''and so I had read everything.' '' And I had memorized.  I memorized 60 sonnets.  And I memorized Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Welden Johnson, Countee Cullen and Edgar Allan Poe.  I loved Poe so much I called him 'Eap' to myself.' ''\n'Maya who?'\nEarly in her writing career, she began renting hotel rooms where she would write.  She would take a yellow pad, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a Bible and a bottle of sherry.\n \"I'm very fortunate, here in my town,'' she said, referring to Winston-Salem, \"to have a hotel which I use.  And everyone there, from the clerks, the counter people, the reservations people, the maids and the janitors and so forth, everyone says they don't know me.\n \"People call or come by and say, 'Is this the place where Maya Angelou is?  And they say, 'Maya who?' \"\nAngelou moved to Winston-Salem in 1981 after being given a lifetime position as the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University.\n \"Not only was she a strong and active member of the faculty,\" said Wilson, the former provost.  \"She brought to the campus other people of distinction, especially African Americans.  That added a kind of special strength and diversity to the Wake Forest community.\" \"\nAngelou found herself at the center of controversy in December 2001 after she partnered with Hallmark Cards on a line of greeting cards and other products.\n \"I think it's preposterous,\" said Billy Collins, poet laureate of the United States.  \"It lowers the understanding of what poetry actually can do.\" \"\nAngelou said she saw it as a literary challenge: to distill an inspiration into two sentences.  \"I have not reduced my value or respect for words or love of the language,\" she told the St. Louis Post Dispatch.  \"I have accepted the challenge to say what I mean succinctly and I'm having a ball.  It was exactly what I needed after 'A Song Flung up to Heaven.' ' \"\n\"A Song Flung up to Heaven\" was the sixth and final volume of her autobiography, published in 2002 and including memories of motherhood, as well as the assassinations in the 1960s of her friends Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\nThe last sentence of that volume is the same as the first sentence of the first:\n\"What are you looking at me for?'' she wrote.  ''I didn't come to stay.\" \"\n\"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas\"",

                    "body": "On April 4, 1928, a new light came into the world with the birth of a little girl in St. Louis, Missouri.  Her daddy's name was Bailey Johnson Sr., a door man, and her mama was Vivian Baxter Johnson, a nurse and sometime professional card dealer.  They named this brand new light Marguerite Johnson.  By the time little Marguerite would leave this world on a gorgeous May morning in 2014, the entire world would have seen that light and known her as Maya Angelou.  As singer, as activist, as mother, as journalist, as actress, as teacher, as wise elder and most of all as a poet, the world was touched deeply by this remarkable woman who lived her epic life against the backdrop of extraordinary times.\n Both icon and iconoclast, Angelou stood astride late 20th century culture, politics, liberation and literature.  A poet able to work through strength and grace and a memoirist of uncommon skill and personal insight, Maya Angelou lived more than one life in a way that enabled her work to resonate with the probing wisdom of a true seeker.  From her struggles as \"Rita,\" a teenage mother on the streets of San Francisco struggling to raise her son Clyde, to her emergence as Maya the professional Calypso dancer at the legendary Purple Onion, Angelou would always keep moving forward, morphing and changing as rapidly and profoundly as the world around her.\n \"The horizon leans forward,\nOffering you space to place new steps of change.\n Here, on the pulse of this fine day\nYou may have the courage\nTo look up and out upon me, the\nRock, the River, the Tree, your country.\" \"\nAngelou would move to Harlem at the dawn of the 1960's with the Civil Rights struggles fully enjoined and a new, powerful awareness of self in the African-American community led by visionaries like herself, who saw that the limitations placed on a person by social and political structures are meaningless when the individual person takes control of their own lives in a commanding way.\n She became a primary organizer for fundraising with the Southern Leadership Conference and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. She lived for a time in Ghana, on the mother continent as a journalist.  Her relationship and work with Brother Malcolm X led her back to America, where should would enter the struggle once again and bear witness to the brutality of the Watts riots as America burned in response to the subterfuge, political marginalization, and murder used to keep the people down.  In more peaceful times, she would re-introduce poetry back into America's political traditions at the 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton.  All of these journeys, all of these mysteries - and Dr. Angelou allowed us, her readers and fellow human beings, to see these events through her eyes.\n Maya Angelou's greatest story was her own, however.  She lived her life as if she was writing a great American narrative with every single day she lived.  From the highs of academia and personal achievement to the pain of personal loss (Dr. King was murdered on her 40th birthday and Brother Malcolm was murdered shortly after they began to work together), Maya Angelou lived a story that was not only quintessentially American- it was a global life.  Like Paul Robeson before her, Maya Angelou carved through life with no quarter given or fool tolerated.  Also like her friend Malcolm X, Dr. Angelou had an inherent understanding of the fluidity of identity, philosophy, artistic endeavor and public perceptions.  The motionless intellect that has decided where it stands on all things is no intellect at all.  Life is change, and to be still is to stagnate and to die.  So it goes...\n Maya Angelou not only saw clearly the collective dream of \"her people,\" she could look into the ether and bear witness to the dreams of us all.  Her own light went out this morning, but those flames she lit during her time on this rock will continue to burn and grow ever brighter as long as people dream.  Life can strip the flesh from bone, but as long as those aspirations and hopes remain, the heart beats.  Like a continually beating heart, Dr. Maya Angelou's work will live on, her words ever written on the wall with a fiery finger.  Before her light left this world, little Marguerite Johnson would fly higher and sing louder than most- her story a living gospel to the breadth of human possibility.  Selah.",

Part of the reason her death has moved so many today is the unusual degree to which Angelou brought her thinking and her writing into Americans' living rooms.\n Angelou's work, as well as her remarkable theater-trained diction, first entered into many viewers' lives with her poem at the 1993 inauguration of President Bill Clinton.  The poet's presence on the stage was a nod to the greater diversity the Clinton administration -- one whose cabinet was famously \"designed to look like America\" -- ushered in.  And the substance of her poem, \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" was a remarkable comment on the optimism of the moment, a time at which it seemed, for Clinton loyalists, as though anything were possible.\n Angelou came to be a familiar presence in daytime television thanks to appearances on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" including an on-air \"pajama party\" in which Angelou told Winfrey that one ought to trust what others tell us about themselves.\" \" It was a tableau remarkable both for the degree of sharp insight and for the setting -- both women were recumbent in bed, just chatting as friends.  Angelou was perhaps too wise and distinguished to feel like a friend, but she felt familiar in the literal sense of the word.\n Maya Angelou's appearance with Dave Chappelle on the series \"Iconoclasts\" in 2006 was another example of just how well Angelou shared the frame with an interviewer or fellow star.  Chappelle, who'd just quit his Comedy Central series under much media scrutiny, sat quietly and deeply absorbed Angelou's story about teaching Tupac Shakur that he was important and had something to give.  (\"Each of us has the chance to be somebody,\" she said in summation.) ) It was a remarkable moment -- one well-chosen by Chappelle as one of his first post-Comedy Central appearances and one that speaks to Angelou's ability to connect on an intimate level.",

Look into your family,\" Angelou said.\n Angelou, who is known for books including \"I know Why the Caged Bird Sings\", also told her listeners to both appreciate and search out the poetry of black Americans.\n \"Black American poetry is so rarely taught, so little characterized and can be credited with the survival of an entire people.\" \"\nLiterature written about blacks by white authors doesn't paint a true picture of the black experience, she said.\n One of her lecture's themes was, \"You've already been paid for.\" \"\n\"Young men and women, you are in an institution of higher education and you've already been paid for.  Everyone in this room has been bought and paid for,\" Angelou said.  Regardless of race, ancestors struggled so that those of today could have the opportunities they currently have, she said.\n \"So, we are paid for without knowing what names we could have had,\" she said.  \"Once you actually know inside yourself that you were loved, that someone loved you, somehow for the first time you can be liberated, never to be quaint by your ignorance.\n \"In higher education you can build your liberation.  Here you can prepare yourself to pay for someone else yet to come,\" she said.\n The library is the key to this, Angelou said.\n \"Go to the librarian and say \"Ms. Angelou mentioned some black American poets and I have a need to know their work.  You're the only one who can help,'\" she said.  \"When the shock is over about three minutes later, the librarian will give all the help you need.\" \"\nPoems by black poets tell blacks that someone before them has gone through the struggle they currently face, Angelou said.  \"Someone was lonely before you, someone was humiliated before you, someone was raped before you ... someone has survived.  That's what you need, the survival with some compassion, literature and style.\n \"Poetry puts starch in your backbone.  For you, this is all you have.  This is it.  Claim everything you can which is good, which is honorable.  Go to the library.\" \"",

A 2002 Times article summarized it this way:\nAt age 3, she moved in with her paternal grandmother in Stamps, Ark., after her parents' divorce.  After reuniting with her mother in St. Louis, she was raped at the age of 7\u00bd by her mother's lover, who was murdered before he could serve his sentence.  Ms. Angelou, who testified against him, did not speak for nearly six years, thinking that her voice had killed him and that if she spoke again, she'd kill someone else.\n In her silent childhood, she developed a love of language and a remarkable memory.  She says she speaks seven or eight languages.\n In a 2010 article about her desire to archive her personal papers and documents, she connected the need to tell her story with African-American history:\nMs. Angelou said that transparency about her life and work connected her to a long African-American tradition of preserving and retelling personal history.\n \"Hold those things that tell your history and protect them,\" she said.  \"During slavery, who was able to read or write or keep anything?  The ability to have somebody to tell your story to is so important.  It says: 'I was here.  I may be sold tomorrow.  But you know I was here.' ' \"\nWhat personal history, whether from your life or from the life of someone in your family past or present, most defines who you are and how you came to be?  How could you tell it?  Consider adapting ideas from our lesson plan Everyday Voices: Finding Black History in Unexpected Places to help.\n Understand the Jim Crow South and How it Shaped Ms. Angelou's Work\n\"If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat,\" Ms. Angelou wrote in \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \"\nLearn about life in the 1930s in Stamps, Ark., via both primary and secondary resources like these from Ferris State University, PBS, the Library of Congress or Duke University.\n What historical context do readers of \"Caged Bird\" need to understand the world in which Ms. Angelou grew up?  Create a gallery walk, multimedia presentation or bulletin board that might help provide background.\n Celebrate Banned Books\n\"Caged Bird\" has been on the American Library Association's list of most frequently challenged books for decades, whether because it has been regarded as too sexually explicit or, as described in this 1998 article, because it was seen as \"anti-white\":\nIn Maryland, two public school superintendents have removed books by prominent black authors from high school English classes at the urging of some parents who called the works \"anti-white.\" \"\nMaya Angelou's autobiographical \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" was removed from the ninth-grade English curriculum in Anne Arundel County, although it will still be taught in the 11th grade, The Washington Post reports.  In St. Mary's County, Toni Morrison's \"Song of Solomon\" was dropped.  Both superintendents overruled faculty committee recommendations and sided with small groups of parents.\n Both the Angelou and the Morrison books are widely considered modern classics of African-American literature.  Ms. Angelou's book, a searing look at her childhood in segregated Arkansas, is a staple in English classes across the country.\n Sue Crandall, the parent who sparked the protest against the Angelou autobiography, called the removal a victory for common sense.  Mrs. Crandall, who is white, said \"Caged Bird\" is sexually explicit.  Moreover, she said, Ms. Angelou \"portrays white people as being horrible, nasty, stupid people.\" \"\nWe have many ideas for celebrating banned books.  Choose one -- whether hosting a \"read-in\" or a \"read-out,\" creating book clubs, blogging, vlogging or creating displays -- to celebrate \"Caged Bird\" and other works banned for similar reasons.\n \"Bitterness is like a cancer; it eats on the host,\" she says.  \"It doesn't do a dern thing to the object.  Anger is good.  It burns things up and leaves nutrients in the earth.  You should be angry at injustices and angry at brutality.  We should be, so we can be angry enough to stop it.\" \"\nWhat injustices make you angry?  What can you do about them?  In a lesson on Ms. Angelou's poem \"Still I Rise,\" Teaching Tolerance suggests that students create a \"Still I Rise\" club or group at their schools dedicated to helping students find their voices and overcome adversity.\n 1988 Article | 'Caged Bird' Is Silenced In Maryland Classrooms\n2002 Article | At 73, a Robust 'People's Poet' Embraces the Prosaic\n2007 Article | A Revised Edition\n2011 Article | Maya Angelou Says She's Disappointed With Rapper After Collaboration\n2014 Obituary | Maya Angelou, Lyrical Witness of the Jim Crow South, Dies at 86\nLearning Network Resources\nGuest Lesson | Reading 'One Today' and Other Inaugural Poems\nReader Ideas | Teaching the Civil Rights Movement\nLesson Plan | One-Way Ticket?

                    "body": "Today we must say goodbye to the body of Maya Angelou -- which is especially difficult with someone like this, who traded in the ageless.  Her extraordinary life, now able to be taken as a whole, is as daunting as it is impressive.\n Dancer, educator, sex worker, activist, speaker, singer, streetcar conductor, author, poet, Hallmark card curator and composer, Maya Angelou lived a fierce and distinguished life.  She was recognized as few other Americans have been, winning Grammys, a Tony, a Pulitzer Prize, a National Medal of Arts, a Presidential Medal of Freedom and dozens of honorary degrees.  She was the second person to ever read poetry at a presidential inauguration.  Perhaps her greatest achievement was the extent to which she loved herself, in a culture not given to convey that message to someone like her.\n \"I agreed a long time ago,\" she tweeted earlier this year, \"I would not live at any cost.  If I am moved or forced away from what I think is the right thing, I will not do it.\" \"\nShe was born Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928.  Because of an unstable home life, she and her brother were sent to live with their relatively prosperous grandmother.  After their father's sudden reappearance a few years later, they were returned to their mother.  It was here, around the age of eight, that Marguerite was raped by her mother's boyfriend.  She told her brother about her assault, and the man was later murdered, probably by her relatives.  As a result, Marguerite stopped speaking.\n \"I thought, my voice killed him,\" she wrote in her 1969 autobiography I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings.  \"I killed that man, because I told his name.  And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone.\" \" The silence lasted for almost five years.\n Angelou was sent again to live with her grandmother, and was brought back to life through literature, shown to her by Bertha Flowers, a family friend and teacher.  At 14, Maya was living with her mother again.  By 17, she was a mother herself and the family dropped into poverty.\n After a brief career as a calypso singer and dancer (changing her name to fit the music), Angelou turned to writing.  She also acted with James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson and danced with Alvin Ailey.  She raised funds for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. The assassination of both men (King was killed on Angelou's 40th birthday) may have knocked her out of her emotional frame, but ultimately brought about the full flowering of her genius.  In 1968, Angelou wrote and produced \"Blacks, Blues, Black!\" a 10-part documentary series and, at the urging of her beloved friend James Baldwin, she wrote her first memoir.\n What followed was a flurry of writing, speaking and composing.  Angelou's film \"Georgia, Georgia\" was the first screenplay by a black woman, and she composed the score to boot.  She played a small part in the groundbreaking miniseries \"Roots\" and became Oprah Winfrey's friend and mentor.  Since 1982, she was the Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, teaching about whatever interested her, from philosophy to ethics to the theater.  She died in Winston-Salem this morning, after having taught for over 30 years.\n Angelou transcended the apparent boundaries and impediments of race, color and income, not only to become her complete and magnificent self, but to help return ourselves to us.  \"We are growing up,\" she noted after Barack Obama's election, \"beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism.\" \"\nThere was a time, in her youth, when Maya Angelou fell silent.  Initially caused by guilt, it allowed her to observe more, remember more, learn more.  When she regained her voice, and she used it to write and sing and dance and speak, it became quintessentially American.  It was measured, thoughtful and authoritative, informed as it was by suffering and redemption.  Every word was enunciated as deliberately as it was chosen.  We will not hear that voice speak again, but we can always listen to what it had to say.\n \"I am grateful,\" she said, \"to have been loved and to be loved now and to be able to love, because that liberates.  Love liberates.  It doesn't just hold -- that's ego.  Love liberates.  It doesn't bind.\" \"",

She held his hand, closed her eyes and read aloud from a suite of poems she deemed perfect for the piece he envisioned -- a cycle of a woman's life from childhood to old age.\n At times, she started singing and clapping along with the poems, and, at times, she repeated lines that were not repeated on the page.\n \"It was one of the greatest performances I have ever witnessed,\" Danielpour said.\n The performance has initiated many others, as from it Danielpour created \"A Woman's Life\" -- a composition for voice and orchestra titled for the series of poems on which it is based.

This is the Nashville Symphony's first performance of the work.\n 'A Woman's Life'\nThough this is also the first time the symphony will present \"A Woman's Life,\" it isn't the orchestra's first foray into Danielpour's oeuvre.  The symphony presented his \"Lacrimae Beati\" for strings in 2010 and in 2011 played the premier performances of his symphony \"Darkness in the Ancient Valley.\" \"\n\"A Woman's Life\" was created especially for soprano Brown and specifically for the lower part of her vocal range, giving her interpretation of Angelou's poems a rich, soulful quality matching the poet's verbal timbre.\n The piece begins from the point of view of a girl brimming with youthful confidence and energy to that of a mature woman casting knowing glances over past loves and experiences.  Set to music very much in the tradition of \"Porgy and Bess\" with bluesy passages and syncopation, \"A Woman's Life\" gives Angelou's already dramatic words even more theatrical presence.\n \"Doing that work was a real love fest,\" Danielpour said.\n Brown, who lives in Indianapolis and studied with vocal coach Ginger Beazley at Huntsville's Oakwood University, first worked with Danielpour in 2005.  She'd stepped in to take Jessye Norman's role in Danielpour's opera \"Margaret Garner.\" \" This was just a year after her Metropolitan Opera debut as Aida, a role for which she earned critical acclaim.\n The composer was so taken with her voice that he decided to write specifically for her.\n Whose words did she want to sing, he asked?  Maya Angelou, came the response.  It was a good answer, because not only was Danielpour already acquainted with the poet, he had plans to visit her in the coming months.  Angelou already had a suite of eight poems that fit Danielpour's vision, and he adapted seven of them.  The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra premiered the piece in 2009.\n \"Angela and I went to Dr. Angelou's house three years (after the initial meeting) and performed it for her,\" Danielpour said.  \"And Dr. Angelou got very upset at me because I made her cry.\" \"\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2014/05/28/archive-danielpours-a-womans-life-based-on-angelou-poems/9669655/",

She left Arkansas as a singer and dancer, eventually performing with Alvin Ailey and recording the album, Calypso Lady.\n Her 1969 memoir was nominated for a National Book Award, and in 2011, Time magazine declared Caged Bird one of the 100 most influential books written in English.

She first gained recognition for her 1969 autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, which made her the first African-American woman to write a best seller.  She was also the first female African-American poet laureate in United States history.  Throughout her career, Angelou inspired many with her wisdom -- and she continued to do so until the end of her life.\n \"She was born black and poor, trouble enough in the rural South of the 1920s.  By age 3, she was the child of a broken home, shunted off to her paternal grandmother's care in tiny Stamps, Ark. Before her 8th birthday, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend and forced to endure the further trauma of his trial; when her assailant was murdered after his release, she blamed herself and spoke hardly at all until she was nearly 13.  At 17, she graduated from high school unwed and eight months pregnant.  A year later, to support herself and her son, Guy, she became the madam of a two-woman whorehouse in San Diego, and then for a short time a prostitute herself.\" \"\n\"Yet today,\" the profile continued, \"this same Maya Angelou is a protean woman, fluent in seven languages and the recipient of 13 honorary degrees.  She was nominated for a National Book Award for her nonfiction and a Tony award for her acting.\" \"\n\"Maya is one of those totally steadfast people with a spine made of iron,\" her longtime friend, Jessica Mitford (author of The American Way of Death) told People at the time.  \"She's a force of nature with so many talents in every direction that the combination comes like an earthquake.\" \"\nHer death has left many celebrities and news sites reflecting and mourning her passing.  See their messages of condolences below.  Rest in peace, Dr. Maya Angelou.",

Headlines splashed across the Internet scream that Maya Angelou died around 5 a.m., eastern time.\n The activist, author and poet inspired millions with her words - the author of Phenomenal Woman, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" and many other works died in her sleep at her home in Greensboro, N.C., on May 28, 2014 at the age of 86.\n Born on April 4, 1928 to a doorman and navy dietitian father and a mother who was a nurse and a card dealer, Marguerite Johnson was nicknamed \"Maya\" by her older brother.  Her parents divorced when she was three; she and her brother traveled alone by train to Stamps, Ariz., to live with their paternal grandmother.  When she was seven, her father appeared in Stamps and returned the children to their mother's care.\n Angelou witnessed many things that some would say a young child shouldn't - including the beating death of her mother's boyfriend the year she and her brother were reunited with their mother.  In her autobiography \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" Angelou wrote that she believed her words had killed the man, so she stopped speaking and no one heard her voice for several years.  During her period of self-imposed muteness, she developed a love of books and literature, and of observing the world around her.\n Throughout her teenage years, she held a variety of jobs - in San Francisco, for example, she worked as the first female black streetcar conductor.  She studied dance and drama at California Labor School, and gave birth to a son three weeks after graduating from high school.\n Her adult life and career\nIn the years following her high school graduation, Angelou held many varied professional positions - including calypso singer, streetcar conductor, single mother, magazine editor in Cairo, administrative assistant in Ghana, a Tony-nominated stage actress; college professor and a professional speaker.  She read a poem at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n She published six volumes of memoirs, including \"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings.\" \" She took her last name as a variation on her name when married to Greek sailor Tosh Angelos.\n In 2010, the Schomberg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, New York received Angelou's personal library - her personal letters and papers that include notes from Malcolm X and Coretta Scott King.  The library was then a staggering 343 boxes of papers.  In an article announcing the Schomberg Center's acquisition, the New York Times quoted Angelou as saying \"Nothing is as precious to me as that library.\" \"\nHer death\nAccording to various media reports, Angelou's agent, Helen Brann reported that the icon had been in ill health for some time, including heart problems, but at this time, no cause of death has been reported.  She recently cancelled an upcoming appearance at the Major League Baseball Civil Rights Game, citing health issues.  Last month, she was hospitalized for an unexpected ailment, according to ABC News reports.\n At the time of her death, she was a professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University, in North Carolina.",

Dearborn St., and recalled arriving as the Clancy Brothers were rehearsing.  They sang a \"revolutionary\" song with the lyrics \"The shamrock is forbidden by law to grow on Irish ground.\" \"\n\"If the words Negro and America were exchanged for shamrock and Irish, the song could be used to describe the situation in the United States,\" she wrote.\n \"I was grateful I had a chance to do that,\" she said of her singing career.\n Later, as she gained a reputation as a civil rights advocate, she appeared at St. Sabina, a Catholic church at 1210 W. 78th Place.  ten times.\n In 2010, speaking at St. Sabina as a guest of the Rev. Michael Pfleger, Angelou told the congregation that the violence in some city neighborhoods was \"madness.\" \"\nAccording to a report in the Sun-Times, Angelou said:\n\"It's come to me to say to each of you, that each of us, we have the possibility of changing somebody.  Remember it.  Stop it.  Don't pretend that you've always been free.  We have a responsibility to those who went before us, and those yet to come.  If you really know who you are, that you've been paid for already, you'll be a kinder person.  You'll be more generous.  You'll look after the children,\" she said.\n \"At some point, we have to stop this madness.  We have to stop it!  We have to say, 'Wait a minute.  Hello!  Hello!  Hello!  No!  No!  Stop it!' \" Angelou said.\n On Wednesday, Pfleger called her \"a queen\" and said there would be a special dance performance in her memory at 10 a.m. on Sunday.\n \"Thank you...for being a voice, for being bold, for standing and for never compromising,\" Pfleger said on Facebook.\n In an interview, the priest added, \"Maya was a person who always had hope for people and never gave up on anyone no matter what.\" \"\nShe was a guest a number of times on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" \" The two met when Winfrey was a local show host in Baltimore.\n Angelou once described how, in 1984, after Winfrey had moved to Chicago, the writer happened to see Winfrey on the street.  They would develop what Winfrey called a \"mother-sister-friend\" relationship.\" \"\nIn 1997, Winfrey chose Angelou's \"The Heart of a Woman\" for her book club, and the writer appeared at the United Center in one of Winfrey's last shows in Chicago in 2011.\n Winfrey often repeated on her show -- 43 times by her own count -- a conversation she had with Angelou where the talk show host told the poet of her troubled 20s.\n \"You did in your 20s what you did,\" she said Angelou told her.  \"When you know better, you do better.\" \"\nIt was a message of learning from your mistakes and moving on, Winfrey said.\n A fan of Angelou since childhood, Winfrey has called her \"one of the greatest influences of my life.  ...  She was the biggest rock star in the world to me.\" \"\nOn Instagram Wednesday, Winfrey added: \"She will always be the rainbow in my clouds.\" \"\nThe two did end up on opposite sides of the presidential primaries in 2008, with Angelou backing Hillary Clinton and Winfrey supporting then-Sen.  Barack Obama.\n In 1995, Angelou appeared in Washington for the Million Man March organized by the Chicago-based Minister Louis Farrakhan and his Nation of Islam.  Of Farrakhan she said: \"I am not his apologist nor the person to interpret him\" but \"he has a right to say what he thinks to be true.\" \"\nIn a statement, Mayor Rahm Emanuel called her \"a true national treasure.\" \"",

Her father kept her for a while, until he found out her mother was seeing another man.\n \"My father wanted to curtail the good times my mother was having, so he just picked us up and dropped us on her doorstep,\" she said.\n \"She tried to handle it, but after I'd been there a couple of months her boyfriend raped me.\" \"\n\"I told my brother the name of the rapist.  He was put in jail for one day and released,\" she recalled.\n \"About three days later five policemen came to my maternal grandmother's house and told her that the man had been found dead.\n \"I was there, and it seemed he'd been kicked to death.\n \"I thought my voice had killed him, so it was better not to speak - so I simply stopped speaking.\" \"\nAngelou said she was encouraged by her mother eventually to talk again, but she became pregnant and had her first child the week of graduation, aged 16.  She then drifted from job to job, working briefly as a prostitute.\n She said she had developed her personal philosophy from this time.\n \"I wrote a book in which I talked about having been a prostitute at 18.  I thought: 'Let me tell young people this - you may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated.  It may even be necessary to encounter some defeats to know who you are.' '\n\"Forgive yourself - no-one else will.\n \"Admit it, you blew it - so what else is new?  Admit it and get out.\" \"\nCivil rights\nAt the time, Angelou's way of getting out was singing, and she released an album called Miss Calypso.\n \"I went to hear Dr Martin Luther King speak in Harlem, and I was so moved by him,\" she said.\n \"Then Dr Martin Luther King's northern representative was about to leave the organisation, and he suggested that I would be the person to come in and step into that position.\" \"\nAngelou said she remembered Dr King as a \"brilliant\" man, whose \"brain was like sparkles of stardust\".\n Angelou also spent some time in Ghana, which had become a key place for African-American intellectuals to visit.\n \"It was so wonderful to be in a country where nobody could complain that one was not given rights, or given promotion, because of one's colour,\" Angelou stated.\n \"It was good to have a place to come to which I could call in my own way a second home.\n \"But I was an American.  I realised that I was that more in Ghana that I ever realised in America.  I realised that my mothers and fathers, and all their people, had enriched the soil of America with their sweat and tears and blood and flesh.\" \"\nShakespeare\nShe returned to America to work with Malcolm X - but two days later he was assassinated.\n \"I was making the big party - the food and all that - and my friend called, and she said: 'Sister, have you listened to the television?  Don't turn on the radio, don't answer the phone until I get there.' '\n\"And she came, and she said Martin Luther King had been killed.  It really unnerved me.\" \"\nSoon afterwards, Angelou began her writing career in earnest - her works in part inspired by Shakespeare.\n \"I was so amazed that he could know so much,\" she said of the playwright.\n \"When I came to a number of sonnets, I thought: 'That has got to be a black girl who wrote that - a black girl who had been sexually abused.' '\"\nAt 75-years-old, Angelou remains part of the US civil rights movement.  She told Everywoman that black Americans had made great progress, but there was still work to do.\n \"We've done some wonderful things in the US - we've come a long way,\" she said.\n \"In outer space there are black men.  We are a tenth of the population.  Black men and women are CEOs of great corporations, and presidents of great universities.\n \"We have pressed very hard, because I have yet to see anyone who opens the door and says: 'African-Americans, come right in here.'

                    "body": "You didn't have to love books or share her background or even know a lot about Maya Angelou to feel that she somehow knew a lot about you.\n You might have sensed you were in a club that accepted everyone and that the reasons for joining were as vast and complicated as the life and talents of the author herself.\n Perhaps it was the story of Angelou, who died Wednesday at age 86: A poor, black woman from the segregated South who somehow ascends to the worldwide stage.  Or the people she befriended: Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, Oprah Winfrey and Toni Morrison, the Clintons and Barack Obama.  You might have seen her read the inaugural poem for Bill Clinton, caught one of her interviews with Winfrey, remembered her from the television series \"Roots\" or were assigned \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" in English class.\n Maybe her speaking voice was enough -- deep, warm and understanding, like a family matriarch or the Supreme Court justice of your dreams; or her written voice, lyrical and personal, inviting you to share and relate to the most hurtful memories, such as the white girls who mocked Angelou's grandmother as they approached the store where the author worked as a child.\n \"Before the girls got to the porch I heard their laughter crackling and popping like pine logs in a cooking stove,\" she wrote in \"Caged Bird,\" published in 1969.  \"I suppose my lifelong paranoia was born in those cold, molasses-slow minutes.\n \"At first they pretended seriousness.  Then one of them wrapped her right arm in the crook of her left, pushed out her mouth and started to hum.  I realized that she was aping my grandmother.\" \"\nAngelou needed half a dozen books just to get through her first 40 years and even longtime followers could find themselves amazed at some new detail they discovered.  Did you know that she and Quincy Jones co-wrote a song for B.B. King, that Muhammad Ali dined at her house in Ghana, that she performed at the same nightclub as Phyllis Diller?  Have you seen that picture of her dancing with Amiri Baraka, or towering over Baraka and Morrison as the three arrived at James Baldwin's funeral?\n Angelou worked not just outside the literary canon, but beyond it.  Awards committees ignored her until nearly the end, but the public seemed to honor Angelou daily.  You'd spot one of her poems or sayings in a yearbook, find yourself among the 5 million liking her Facebook page, or learning that one of your friends had read -- and loved -- \"Caged Bird,\" too.\n In every way, she seemed without limits.  She could write, sing, dance, compose, act and direct.  Depending on your age, or background, she was like a mother, a sister, a close friend, a sage.  You may not have liked everything she did, but it seemed impossible not to at least admire one thing, and for that to be enough to admire her overall.\n Her body had been weak for years, but her spirit will live on.  At a gala poetry reading last month at Lincoln Center, the actress Rosie Perez smirked and strutted as she reeled off the unstoppable lines of Angelou's \"Still I Rise\":\nDoes my sassiness upset you?\n Why are you beset with gloom?\n'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells\nPumping in my living room.\n Just like moons and like suns,\nWith the certainty of tides,\nJust like hopes springing high,\nStill I'll rise.",

Bush.\n She punctuated that reading with a plea of hope.\n \"Rising high, high above me...a constant call up from misery, leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise into daybreak miraculously clear.  I still rise.\" \"\nThat is what she did to become an author, poet, actress, songwriter, dancer, college professor, historian.  She was winner of three Grammy awards and directed and produced movies.\n She rose up from a humble childhood in Stamps, Ark. When she was 8, she was raped by her mother's boyfriend.  Shortly after Angelou identified her rapist, the man was murdered.  Angelou blamed herself and stopped talking.\n \"From the time I was eight until I was almost 13 I didn't speak,\" she said in a 1993 interview.\n \"My grandmother would say, 'Mama don't care what these people say about you being an idiot or you being a moron, mama don't care.  Mama knows that when you and the good lord get ready, sister you gonna be a preacher.' ' I used to sit there and think 'poor ignorant mama'.  I'll never speak, what she talking about preachin' but she continue to tell me that 'You don't have to talk.  When you and the good Lord get ready.' '\"\nWhen she was ready to speak, she went on to master five foreign languages and live in Africa, where she met Malcolm X. His influence positioned her as a prominent voice in Civil Rights in the 1960s.\n \"I don't know how people see their world.  Whites can see a world with no blacks; blacks can see a world with no whites -- that's very rare if at all; Asians can see a world with no Latinos; or fat people see a world with no thin.  I won't live in that world.\" \"\nAngelou's most acclaimed work -- \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" -- is her story to age 17, the age that she quit high school to support her son as a single mother:\n\"The Caged Bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom.\" \"\nThere were six autobiographical volumes of poetry -- all resonating back to her roots and those of her deeply southern ancestors.\n Possibly her crowning moment came when she was asked to write a poem for the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n \"The rock cries out to us clearly, forcefully -- come, you may stand up on my back and face your distance destiny.\" \"\nYet, it was her passion for teaching that she prized.  As a long-time professor at Wake Forest University she gave voice to a new generation.\n \"I realize that if I had taught before I had written a book I might never have written a book.  I love to teach.  I am a teacher.\" \"\nShe was a teacher, who always remained that example of hope.\n \"I am the hope and the dream of the slave ... and so there I go.  There I go.\" \"",

In addition to originals like \"Donkey City,\" \"Neighbor, Neighbor\" and \"Mambo In Africa,\" Angelou recorded songs by Nat King Cole (\"Calypso Blues\"), Louis Jordan (\"Run Joe\") and Wilmouth Houdini (\"Stone Cold Dead In The Market\") for the album.\n The latter is a revenge fantasy about putting an end to an abusive spouse, in which a wife kills beats her husband to death with a frying pan.

It was the only feature film she ever directed.\n Based on an original script by Myron Goble, \"Down in the Delta\" focused on Loretta (Alfre Woodard), a struggling single parent who gets sent to Mississippi by her mother (Mary Alice) to clean up her life.  There, Loretta meets a coterie of family and friends.  Wesley Snipes and Loretta Divine co-starred.\n \"Angelou's first-time direction stays out of its own way; she doesn't call attention to herself with unnecessary visual touches, but focuses on the business at hand,\" Ebert wrote.  \"She and Goble are interested in what might happen in a situation like this, not in how they can manipulate the audience with phony crises.\" \"\nIn addition to \"Down in the Delta,\" Angelou directed an episode of \"Visions.\" \" As an actress, she appeared in the hit miniseries \"Roots,\" the 1993 film \"Poetic Justice\" with Janet Jackson, \"How to Make an American Quilt\" and an episode of \"Touched by an Angel.\" \" Angelou is credited as co-writer on the 1979 television adaptation of \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" her iconic autobiography.

                    "body": "Ms. Angelou was arguably the best-known poet and memoirist of her generation.  She first earned widespread acclaim with the publication of her memoir, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" brought out in 1969.  The book told of her life up until the age of 17, growing up among rampant racism and crippling poverty in rural Arkansas, and addressed traumatic incidents such as an instance of childhood rape, and the subsequent murder of her attacker.  The memoir is often characterized as being as much a work of literature as it is an autobiography, and is considered a milestone in African-American writings.  The writer Julian Mayfield called it \"a work of art that eludes description.\" \" The book was nominated for a National Book Award and became a bestseller.\n She followed up that success with six successive works of autobiography, published between 1974 and 2013.  They include \"Gather Together in My Name,\" \"Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas,\" \"The Heart of a Woman,\" \"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes,\" \"A Song Flung Up to Heaven\" and \"Mom & Me & Mom.\" \" All were edited by her longtime editor, Robert Loomis at Random House, who retired in 2011.  The two were brought together by her good friend, the novelist James Baldwin.\n When Bill Clinton was inaugurated as President in 1993, he selected his fellow native-Arkansan Ms. Angelou to compose and recite a poem for the occasion.  The reading of that poem, \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" was witnessed by millions, and the event remains closely identified with Ms. Angelou's public persona.\n Her connection to the stage and performing was forged early on.  She danced and sang Calypso music in clubs in San Francisco.  She also teamed up with a young Alvin Ailey in an act called Al and Rita.  (It was at this time she adopted the stage name of Maya Angelou, discarding her given name, Marguerite Ann Johnson.) ) She was successful enough to have recorded an album.  In the mid-50s, she toured Europe in a production of Porgy and Bess.\n By the late '50s, she had moved to New York and begun concentrating on writing.  In 1961, she performed in the legendary Off-Broadway production of Jean Genet's The Blacks, acting alongside the young James Earl Jones, Roscoe Lee Brown, Louis Gossett and Cicely Tyson.\n After meeting the South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make, she moved with her son to Cairo, where she edited an English-language newspaper.  From there, she moved to Ghana, where she stayed until 1965, working at the University of Ghana, editing The African Review and performing at Ghana's National Theatre.\n While in Ghana, she met and befriended Malcolm X. She returned to the U.S. to work with him, and helped him form the Organization of Afro-American Unity, but he was assassinated soon after.  History cruelly repeated itself when Martin Luther King Jr., shortly after asking Angelou to organize a march in 1968, was also assassinated.  The two deaths affected Ms. Angelou deeply and left her depressed.  (Dr. King was killed on April 4, which was her date of birth in 1928.  For years afterward, she refused to celebrate her birthday.) ) Not long after, however, Loomis encouraged her to try her hand at telling her own story in book form.\n She starred in a Jerome Kilty play, Look Away, about Mary Todd Lincoln's stay in a mental asylum, on Broadway in 1972.  Co-starring Geraldine Page and directed by Rip Torn, it closed quickly.  Nonetheless, her performance was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973.\n She made a notable appearance on the small screen in 1977 when she played Kunta Kinte's grandmother in the widely viewed mini-series \"Roots.\" \"\nHer many volumes of poetry include \"Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'for I Die,\" \"And Still I Rise,\" \"Now Sheba Sings the Song,\" \"I Shall Not Be Moved\" and \"Phenomenal Women.\" \" Her plays include Cabaret for Freedom, The Least of These, Getting' Up Stayed on My Mind, Sophocles, Ajax and And Still I Rise.  She also wrote two cookbooks.",

I wanted to write about her homes, I told her assistant, who I tracked down through Wake Forest University, where Ms. Angelou taught.  I was surprised, and ecstatic, when she agreed to meet me.\n A few weeks later, I flew from New York to North Carolina, rented a car and drove to Ms. Angelou's bright yellow house in Winston-Salem.  I wrote down every question and came prepared with a recorder and two backup notebooks.  I even jotted down conversation starters -- \"I know you lived in Brooklyn when you were young; I just moved there,\" and the like.\n An assistant greeted me at the door and ushered me into the dining room.  The walls were painted a deep blue, and framed photographs covered most surfaces.  In the center of the table, a glass cube sculpture, designed by glass artist Jon Kuhn, spun on a point, catching the light and creating patterns on the walls.\n Ms. Angelou sat at the dining room table.  And from there, I realized I didn't need to worry.  We spent over an hour talking about her homes and life.  Her memory was sharp, and she rattled off names and places easily.  Her voice is lyrical, like she's speaking in a poem.\n After the interview, she leaned back and shut her eyes.  I took that as my cue to leave.\n Ms. Angelou called her assistant to serve up some cornbread salad.  Ms. Angelou learned how to cook from her mother and grandmother, but said once in a while, she finds a new Southern recipe that she loves.  She found this one in a newspaper a few days ago.  It was such a hit, she made another batch.\n Ms. Angelou then proceeded to tell me how to make it.  \"You make a dressing.  Olive oil, balsamic oil, fresh ground pepper, a couple of tablespoons of honey mustard, the good mustard, and then finely shaved red onion.  I get a can of pinto beans and open them and wash them, all that soup stuff out, and try to shake it dry.  Then I put that into the dressing so it kind of marinates.  You put in the shaved onion and two nice sized diced tomatoes, nice and ripe.  And then, crumble up the cornbread, start to ladle the dressing over the cornbread.  Cut up a good sized avocado and put that down.  Then more cornbread and more dressing.\" \"\nIt was delicious.\n At this point, we are sitting at the kitchen table, set in between the kitchen and dining room.  In stark contrast with the dining room, this room looks almost messy -- dozens of framed photos on the window seat, books stacked on the piano bench.  Letters, papers and a folded crossword puzzle are scattered across a mustard yellow tablecloth.\n Ms. Angelou tells me this is the room where she writes, on the rare occasion she decides to write at home (she usually keeps a hotel room in whatever city she happens to be in).\n At the end of the day, more than three hours after I had arrived, Ms. Angelou gave me a signed copy of her book of essays, Letter to My Daughter.\n She said many wonderful things during that interview, but one part in particular didn't make it into my final story.  I'm grateful for the chance to print it now.\n I asked her, \"I once read a quote of yours: 'I long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself.' ' Where is that from?  Do you find yourself at home in this house?\"\nShe said, \"I was really talking about the necessity for human beings to accept that we are human and that nothing human can be alien to us.  That's a statement made by Terence in 154 BC.  I am a human being.  Nothing human can be alien to me.  Whenever I'm with human beings, I find myself at home.  I don't care who they are.  I don't care what language they speak.  I know that there's no fear they can feel deeper than I, than fear I fear.  No joy, no bliss more wonderful.  So if I speak about the delight of having a healthy child in my lap, a person in Des Moines, Iowa, a white woman in Nashville, Tennessee, an Asian man in Manila, a Spaniard in Madrid, an African in South Africa -- everybody can know that feeling.  So I feel at home whenever I am with human beings.  They may not, depending on their narrowness of thinking.  They may think I'm different from them.  I'm not.  So that's what I meant by that.\" \"",

                    "body": "This article was originally published Saturday, October 11, 2003.\n With her regal presence and deep voice that makes every sentence, however mundane, seem like an incantation, Maya Angelou is the queen of the downtrodden.\n From high up in Toronto's SkyDome, engulfed in a sea of the sisterhood (with the occasional supportive male), I watched her speaking at a recent Unique Lives and Experiences lecture.  Her message was simple and saccharine.  God put a rainbow in the clouds to give us hope and each of us has a rainbow within.\n Her remarks were not surprising.  Courage is her brand.\n Angelou spoke extemporaneously for more than an hour about her life of legendary triumph over adversity.  Born Marguerite Johnson 75 years ago, she was raped at 7 by a boyfriend of her mother, with whom she lived briefly after her parents separated.  She told her older brother, Bailey, what happened.  When the man was arrested, released and then beaten to death, she thought that her voice was to blame.  She refused to speak for almost seven years.  Her life did not get any easier.  At 16, she had a son out of wedlock and in the years that followed, she struggled to make ends meet by working in shops and clubs and resorting to prostitution.\n She never gave up and always reinvented herself.  She has been a singer, a composer, a dancer in Porgy and Bess, an actor in the Obie Award-winning play, The Blacks, and in such films as Calypso Heat Wave and How to Make an American Quilt, a civil-rights activist, a journalist, a writer for television and Hollywood, and a director, in 1998, of Down in the Delta.  But her most successful career move came in 1970 when she published I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, a memoir of her traumatic childhood that stayed on The New York Times bestseller list for two years.  Since then, she has become an international icon as earth mother to the masses.  She has written six autobiographies in all, the latest (in 2002) and reportedly the last being A Song Flung Up to Heaven.\n The shock that night was the realization that so many women feel like victims, in need of an Angelou fix of hope.  \"I feel so much better,\" I heard more than one woman say as we exited the stadium.\n The first question I ask Angelou the next day is why she thinks women are so needy.\n \"Well,\" she drawls in her rich molasses voice on the phone from her hotel room.  \"Usually we see people and think that what they look like is who they are.  They may look rich in a rich country where money is adored, or white in a white country, but behind that there can be so many fathers who ignored them, so many teachers who underestimated them -- I'm talking about women in particular -- so many sales people who make you feel silly and out of place.\n \"In the case of many white women,\" she continues, \"they have been told either implicitly or explicitly that they are not really important.  [The cultural message is] I can run my companies without you.  I can send my planes in the air, my trains across the rails without you.  I need you in the kitchen.\" \"\nWomen must have an innate inferiority complex, I suggest.  \"Yes, they do,\" she responds.  \"It shows itself on the surface as well as in the interior.\" \"\nHas feminism failed women then? \"It hasn't done nearly enough,\" she says.  \"The problem is historical.  It has been going on for so long, and you can't expect a movement in 20 or 30 years to undo thousands of years of brainwashing.\" \"\nBut aren't women partly to blame for that?  There are just as many contra-feminists as there are feminists.  \"Well, sometimes it's impossible if you're already burdened down to let your burden down,\" she explains in a low rumble.  \"If you've been impacted with all this erroneous information and someone says to you, 'Come, you can let your burden down,' maybe people would say, 'This isn't a burden.  This is me.' ' \"",

                    "body": "Editor's note: This story was originally published in The Eagle on Dec. 21, 1996.\n If Maya Angelou left only the smallest trace of herself - the tiniest vibration from that awesome, boundless voice as she chanted and sang and roared with laughter in the walls of Wichita's new northeast branch library Friday - that blessed building will stand solid for a century or more.\n And if the hundreds of people who came to see her, lined up in the cold and peered through windows and doors when there was no more room inside kept anything of hers in their hearts when they left, then they will not soon forget the week before Christmas 1996 and the gift she brought them.\n When they sit in that library - or any library - they will feel that sense of sanctuary, that connection to all human experience that Angelou says saved her life and might save their lives someday, too.\n When they read to their children, they will hear her urging them not to put the book down, not to give into fatigue or indifference, not to leave their children alone in a bewildering electronic wasteland.\n They will hear her speaking.\n \"The human voice is so powerful, \" she said, \"so very powerful.  Much more powerful than the sword - or the pen.\" \"\nThe celebration of the christening of the Maya Angelou Northeast Library at 21st and Hillside felt and sounded more like a church revival than a mere formality in opening of a new public building.\n It was an old story to anyone who had read her best-selling book, \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\" \" How, when she was only a child, she had named the man who raped her.  How he was beaten to death for what he had done.\n \"I thought my voice had killed him, \" she said.  \"So I stopped speaking.  I thought if I spoke, my voice might just go out and kill somebody randomly.\" \"\nHow her mother's family had given up on her, a sullen mute, and sent her back to Stamps, Ark., to live with her maternal grandmother, whom she called \"Mama.\" \"\n\"She said, 'Sister, Mama don't care what these people say about you can't talk, that you must be an idiot, you must be a moron.  Sister, Mama don't care.  Mama knows when you and the good Lord get ready you gonna be a preacher.' ' \"\nIt is a strong story.  Strong enough, in fact, to make \"Caged Bird\" one of those books that some people are always trying to ban.  So strong it is hard to believe it is written by a woman who wants, more than anything else, to reach children, and who is, more than anything else, a teacher.\n She told the people at the library about her speeches earlier in the day at South High and East High.\n \"Those children .  .  .  were just sitting in my hands, as if they were the last raw eggs in the world, \" she said.  \"So beautiful.  And they listened.\" \"\nAnd she explained why naming a library for a living writer - a black woman - was so important to her in more than merely a personal way.\n She told them her theory that two children - one black and the other white, both the same in every other way - may enter school together and soon find themselves far apart.\n She said: \"The white child looks up on the wall and the portraits look like his grandfather.  The black child looks up and there's nobody that looks like her or him.  Years pass and they open the book, and the portraits in the book do not look like the girl or boy, the black one.  Sooner or later the white boy or girl must think: This is my stuff.  And the other children have to think: This is not my stuff.  So by fourth grade, the black boy starts to back up.  He says: I'm not in this.  You all have this.\" \"\nAll writers, from herself to Shakespeare, belong to all children, she said.  There should be no lines drawn, she said.  And it's so easy to make a mistake, she said, like the California school system that has declared black dialect a second language.\n \"I'm incensed, \" she said, during an interview Friday afternoon at the house of her friend George Rogers.  \"The very idea that African-American language is a language separate and apart is very threatening.  Because it can encourage young men and women not to learn standard English.\" \"\nAfter the ceremony at the library, Angelou was the guest of honor at a reception in the ballroom on the third floor of the Campus Activities Center at Wichita State University.\n Hundreds of people showed up to ask her to sign autographs and hundreds more were still waiting in line when, after about an hour and a half, she apologized and said she could do no more.",

                    "body": "On Wednesday, Maya Angelou, poet, author and presence, passed away at 86 after a long and extremely full life.\n One of the odd consequences of spending much of our lives online is the proliferation of tributes.  One or two obituaries are no longer the sum total.  The big headline items are no longer the only ones you hear about.  In public or in private life, from notes posted on Facebook at the loss of a family member, to myriads of online articles for a celebrity, you get a powerful sense of the infinite ways we tangle with each other's lives.\n It generally is a thing of beauty, even when it gets into, \"No, I knew Christopher Hitchens More!\" \"No, I knew him more!\" \"OH YEAH?  DID YOU EVER SUMMER WITH HITCH?!?\" territory.  The person you know as a major-league baseball player turns out to have been active in the cat fancier community; the fallen soldier was also that guy from Reddit.  Everyone leads so many lives, and more than one life ends at a passing.  Even when an incident seems trivial -- \"The deceased was ALWAYS in front of me in line to get coffee, and he sometimes answered the trivia questions on the chalkboard\" -- it can be incredibly moving to hear from this chorus of voices.\n Yes, there can be something self-serving about the traffic grab involved in a tribute to someone whose death everyone is reading about.  But there are right ways of doing this.\n Never mind that the rest of the article goes on to say that the author didn't particularly care for Angelou's writing, himself, but begrudgingly notes that she \"dispensed sound if unspectacular wisdom of the type that is said to boost childrens' self-esteem.\" \" (I, for one, want that on my tombstone.) ) Let's just focus on the headline.  The headline hinges on one exchange in an interview with Time's Belinda Luscombe, where Angelou admitted that she had guns around the house and had used one for self-defense.\n I understand the impulse to frame the passing of a noteworthy figure in terms of what appeals to your niche audience.  If I ever pass away after winning, say, a Nobel prize for Economics (hey, half of that sentence is guaranteed) the headline in \"Knitter's World\" will be \"Eminent Sweater-Wearer Shuffles Off Her Mortal Coil.\" \"\nThis can be done in a way that is charming instead of crass.\n But there is a limit.  And you hit it when your headline can be summarized in the phrase: \"RIP [Name], Who Shared My Opinion On This Controversial Issue (Hey, [Name], Feel Free To Speak Up If You Disagree.) )\" Headlines that would have been a touuuuuch iffy in the course of the person's lifetime do not suddenly become fair game because the person is unable to object.  Especially when, after the California shooting, the controversial issue in question is hovering very visibly in the public eye.  I don't know what Angelou would have said about the headline.  Maybe she would have been on board.  But it's a little grotesque to claim her for your team like this, meanwhile decrying the thing that she's actually famous for: her ability to speak for herself.\n As is often the case, there's a Angelou quote that speaks to this.  \"People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\" \" I guess \"vigorously pro-gun\" is how she made him feel.  Then again, given his opinion of her work, I'm not sure how much she actually had to do with this at all",

I've been coming home to Harlem for 50 years.\" \"\nThe 3,500-square-foot brownstone with an elevator and a wine cellar was in bad shape when she bought it in 2004 -- it had been set on fire and vandalized, and taken on rainwater.\n \"I redid everything,\" she told The Wall Street Journal in 2012.  \"I put a lot of money in it.\" \"\nShe decorated it \"to look like a bowl of summer fruit,\" with walls and floors in watermelon pink, tomato red and plum.  Rooms are accented with furniture in lime green, yellow and royal blue.\n Angelou was able to preserve the home's original oak moldings, the Journal said.\n According to the Journal, she didn't do her writing at any of her three homes, but would instead check into a hotel when she wanted to work.",

And that and much more was before most people had ever heard of her, before she was lionized for her autobiographies and poetry.\n In short, she lived a life that should cause us to question the meaning and direction of our own.

Hab\u00eda trabajado como profesora de estudios estadounidenses en la escuela desde 1982.  Esta semana ten\u00eda previsto asistir a una ceremonia de premios, pero cancel\u00f3 hace unos d\u00edas por una dolencia.\n Fue actriz, cantante y bailarina en las d\u00e9cadas de los cincuenta y sesenta.  Debut\u00f3 como autora en 1970 con Yo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado, que se convirti\u00f3 en lectura habitual (y a veces censurada) y que le llev\u00f3 a ser una de las primeras mujeres negras en disfrutar de un gran \u00e9xito comercial.\n En 1993 ley\u00f3 su poema \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" en la primera inauguraci\u00f3n presidencial de Bill Clinton.  Su aplomo encant\u00f3 a Clinton e hizo del poema un best-seller y favorito de la cr\u00edtica.  12 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, ley\u00f3 su poema\"Amazing Peace\" en la ceremonia del encendido del \u00e1rbol de Navidad en la Casa Blanca para el presidente George W. Bush.\n En el comunicado de prensa dado a conocer en la cuenta de Twitter de la Casa Blanca, Obama y su esposa recuerdan que \"Maya fue muchas cosas: autora, poeta, activista por los derechos civiles, actriz, directora, compositora, cantante y bailarina.  Pero sobre todas estas cosas, era una contadora de historias, y sus mejores historias eran reales\".\n Obama afirm\u00f3 que la vida y obra de la escritora estadounidense inspiraron a su madre, Ann Dunham, a nombrar a su hermana Maya.\n Angelou era pol\u00edglota y public\u00f3 no s\u00f3lo poes\u00eda, sino libros de consejos, cocina, cuentos para ni\u00f1os, obras teatrales y guiones de cine.  Recibi\u00f3 una nominaci\u00f3n al premio Emmy por su actuaci\u00f3n en \"Roots\", y nunca perdi\u00f3 su pasi\u00f3n por la danza, el arte que consideraba m\u00e1s cercano a la poes\u00eda.\n Fue una mentora para Oprah Winfrey, de quien se hizo amiga cuando \u00e9sta era una reportera de televisi\u00f3n local, y a menudo apareci\u00f3 en su programa de tertulia.\n Su mismo nombre de adulta fue una reinvenci\u00f3n.  Angelou naci\u00f3 como Marguerite Johnson en San Luis y creci\u00f3 en Arkansas y California, entre las casas de sus padres y su abuela.\n Su vida tambi\u00e9n tuvo momentos tr\u00e1gicos: a los siete a\u00f1os fue violada por el novio de su madre y no pronunci\u00f3 palabra en mucho tiempo.  A los 17 tuvo un beb\u00e9 y era madre soltera.  De veintea\u00f1era bail\u00f3 en un bar nudista, oper\u00f3 un prost\u00edbulo, se cas\u00f3 y luego se divorci\u00f3.\n Barack y Michelle Obama agradecieron en el comunicado sus encuentros con Angelou y reconocieron que \"siempre les recordaba que todos somos hijos de Dios\".  En 2010, de la mano del primer presidente negro de EU, recibi\u00f3 la Medalla Presidencial de la Libertad, la concesi\u00f3n civil m\u00e1s prestigiosa del pa\u00eds junto con la Medalla de Oro del Congreso.  En 2013 fue condecorada con el Premio Nacional Honorario de Literatura.\n Al recibir la Medalla Presidencial de la Libertad, Angelou dijo en entrevista con la Oficina de Prensa de la Casa Blanca que \"si pudiera decidir, escoger\u00eda ser negra, estadounidense, mujer y haber nacido en el siglo XX.  \u00a1Y as\u00ed fue!  \u00a1Qu\u00e9 suerte la m\u00eda!\".",

Ten\u00eda 86 a\u00f1os.\n El hijo de Angelou, Guy B. Johnson, dijo que la autora falleci\u00f3 en su casa en Winston-Salem, Carolina del Norte, donde dio clases de estudios americanos en la Universidad de Wake Forest desde 1982.\n Alta y elegante, con una voz profunda y majestuosa, Angelou desafi\u00f3 toas las probabilidades y se convirti\u00f3 en una de las primeras mujeres negras que disfrut\u00f3 el \u00e9xito comercial como autora y en pr\u00e1cticamente todos los medios art\u00edsticos.  Fue la joven madre soltera que se ganaba la vida en clubes de estript\u00eds y luego recit\u00f3 el poema de juramentaci\u00f3n presidencial m\u00e1s difundido de la historia.  La ni\u00f1a v\u00edctima de violaci\u00f3n que escribi\u00f3 un best-seller con sus memorias, fue amiga de Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela y el reverendo Martin Luther King Jr., y actu\u00f3 en escenarios alrededor del mundo.\n Actriz, cantante y bailarina en las d\u00e9cadas de 1950 y 1960, debut\u00f3 como autora en 1970 con \"Yo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado\", que se convirti\u00f3 en lectura habitual (y a veces censurada), y que dio inicio a una autobiograf\u00eda de varias partes que continu\u00f3 por d\u00e9cadas.\n En 1993 caus\u00f3 sensaci\u00f3n al leer su cautelosamente esperanzador \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" (\"En el pulso de la ma\u00f1ana\") en la primera juramentaci\u00f3n presidencial de Bill Clinton.  Su aplomo encant\u00f3 a Clinton e hizo del poema un best-seller y favorito de la cr\u00edtica.  Para el presidente George W. Bush ley\u00f3 otro poema, \"Amazing Peace\", en la ceremonia del encendido del \u00e1rbol de Navidad en la Casa Blanca en el 2005.\n Fue una mentora para Oprah Winfrey, de quien se hizo amiga cuando \u00e9sta era una reportera de televisi\u00f3n local, y a menudo apareci\u00f3 en su programa de tertulia.  Domin\u00f3 varios idiomas y public\u00f3 no s\u00f3lo poes\u00eda, sino libros de consejos, cocina y cuentos para ni\u00f1os.  Escribi\u00f3 m\u00fasica, obras teatrales y guiones de cine, recibi\u00f3 una nominaci\u00f3n al premio Emmy por su actuaci\u00f3n en \"Roots\", y nunca perdi\u00f3 su pasi\u00f3n por la danza, el arte que consideraba m\u00e1s cercano a la poes\u00eda.\n Su mismo nombre de adulta fue una reinvenci\u00f3n.  Angelou naci\u00f3 como Marguerite Johnson en San Luis y creci\u00f3 en Stamps, Arkansas, y San Francisco, entre las casas de sus padres y su abuela.  Era inteligente y fresca al punto del peligro; su familia la despach\u00f3 a California tras hablarle descaradamente al encargado blanco de una tienda en Arkansas.  Otras veces no habl\u00f3: a los 7 a\u00f1os fue violada por el novio de su madre y no pronunci\u00f3 palabra por a\u00f1os.  Aprendi\u00f3 a leer, y a escuchar.\n A los 9 a\u00f1os ya escrib\u00eda poes\u00eda.  A los 17 era madre soltera.  De veintea\u00f1era bail\u00f3 en un bar nudista, oper\u00f3 un prost\u00edbulo, se cas\u00f3 (con Enistasious Tosh Angelos, el primero de sus tres maridos) y luego se divorci\u00f3.  By her mid-20s, she was performing at the Purple Onion in San Francisco, where she shared billing with another future star, Phyllis Diller.\n Angelou era poco conocida afuera de la comunidad teatral hasta \"Yo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado\", un libro ocasionalmente criticado por su contenido.\n En un ensayo publicado en 1999 por Harper's, el autor Francine Prose calific\u00f3 \"El p\u00e1jaro enjaulado\" como un melodrama \"manipulador\".  Entretanto, los pasajes de Angelou sobre su violaci\u00f3n y su embarazo adolescente lo han hecho un perenne en la lista de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Bibliotecas Estadounidenses de obras que atraen quejas de padres y educadores.\n \"Pens\u00e9 que era un libro leve.  No tiene profanidad\", dijo Angelou a la AP. \"Habla de supervivencia, y de verdad que no hace ogros de mucha gente.  Me impresion\u00f3 encontrar personas que realmente quer\u00edan prohibirlo, y todav\u00eda creo que la gente que est\u00e1 en contra del libro nunca lo ha le\u00eddo\".\n ___\nEl corresponsal de AP Michael Biesecker, en Raleigh, Carolina del Norte, contribuy\u00f3 a este despacho.",

Maya Angelou, poeta, activista y artista, ha fallecido a los 86 a\u00f1os en su casa en Winston Salem (Carolina del Norte), seg\u00fan ha confirmado su agente literaria, Helen Brann.  Autora de 30 libros, entre los que hay seis autobiograf\u00edas, ganadora de tres premios Grammy en categor\u00eda de palabra hablada y condecorada con la medalla de la Libertad por Barack Obama en el 2011, receptora de 30 t\u00edtulos honor\u00edficos de universidades y directora en cine, televisi\u00f3n y teatro, Angelou convirti\u00f3 su poes\u00eda en un l\u00edrico testigo de las aberraciones de la opresi\u00f3n racial y del poder humano de resistencia y superaci\u00f3n.\n 'Yo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado', que public\u00f3 en 1969, fue la primer autobiograf\u00eda de una autora negra con repercusi\u00f3n masiva.

Nacida el 4 de abril de 1928 en San Luis (Misuri) y criada tambi\u00e9n en el segregado Arkansas, Angelou fue violada a los siete a\u00f1os por el novio de su madre.  Despu\u00e9s de que lo denunciara, el hombre fue linchado por una masa enfurecida y Angelou entr\u00f3 en un periodo de seis a\u00f1os de silencio.  All\u00ed empez\u00f3 a descubrir la poes\u00eda.\n En su juventud empez\u00f3 a formarse en danza y drama poniendo en marcha una carrera que le llevar\u00eda a giras por Europa, Broadway, la compa\u00f1\u00eda de Alvin Ailey y pel\u00edculas y televisi\u00f3n.  Madre soltera desde los 17 a\u00f1os, y tras un breve matrimonio con un marinero, se cas\u00f3 con un activista surafricano de derechos civiles, Vusumi Make, y viaj\u00f3 a Egipto y Ghana, donde conoci\u00f3 a Malcom X, a quien se unir\u00eda en la lucha por la igualdad racial de regreso a Estados Unidos.  Fue tambi\u00e9n amiga de Martin Luther King, asesinado el d\u00eda del cumplea\u00f1os de Angelou.  \"Ret\u00f3 lo que se asum\u00eda sobre qu\u00e9 era posible para una pobre chica del sur y emergi\u00f3 como una figura de valor, honestidad y gracia\", ha declarado a The Washington Post Arnold Rampersad, cr\u00edtico literario y profesor em\u00e9rito de Stanford.  \"Puso en primer plano una comprensi\u00f3n de los dilemas y peligros y j\u00fabilos de la feminidad blanca m\u00e1s que ning\u00fan otro autobi\u00f3grafo en su tiempo\".\n En la investidura de Bill Clinton como presidente en 1993, con un poema propio, Angelou se convirti\u00f3 en la segunda poeta tras Robert Frost a la que se daba ese honor.  Aunque nunca se gradu\u00f3 en la universidad, era conocida popularmente como la Doctora Angelou y en 1981 la Universidad de Wake Forest le hizo miembro de por vida de la facultad.  En un discurso en 1990 a estudiantes de Louisiana, Angelou resumi\u00f3 todo el poder de su historia y de su ejemplo.  \"Miradme: negra, mujer, estadounidense y del sur.  Miradme y miraos a vosotros mismos.  \u00bfQu\u00e9 no pod\u00e9is hacer?\".",

Ten\u00eda 86 a\u00f1os.\n El hijo de Angelou, Guy B. Johnson, dijo que la autora falleci\u00f3 en su casa en Winston-Salem, Carolina del Norte, donde dio clases de estudios americanos en la Universidad de Wake Forest desde 1982.\n Alta y elegante, con una voz profunda y majestuosa, Angelou desafi\u00f3 todas las probabilidades y se convirti\u00f3 en una de las primeras mujeres negras que disfrut\u00f3 el \u00e9xito comercial como autora y en pr\u00e1cticamente todos los medios art\u00edsticos.  Fue la joven madre soltera que se ganaba la vida en clubes de estript\u00eds y luego recit\u00f3 el poema de juramentaci\u00f3n presidencial m\u00e1s difundido de la historia.  La ni\u00f1a v\u00edctima de violaci\u00f3n que escribi\u00f3 un best-seller con sus memorias, fue amiga de Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela y el reverendo Martin Luther King Jr., y actu\u00f3 en escenarios alrededor del mundo.\n Actriz, cantante y bailarina en las d\u00e9cadas de 1950 y 1960, debut\u00f3 como autora en 1970 con \"Yo s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado\", que se convirti\u00f3 en lectura habitual (y a veces censurada), y que dio inicio a una autobiograf\u00eda de varias partes que continu\u00f3 por d\u00e9cadas.\n En 1993 caus\u00f3 sensaci\u00f3n al leer su cautelosamente esperanzador \"On the Pulse of the Morning\" (\"En el pulso de la ma\u00f1ana\") en la primera juramentaci\u00f3n presidencial de Bill Clinton.  Su aplomo encant\u00f3 a Clinton e hizo del poema un best-seller y favorito de la cr\u00edtica.  Para el presidente George W. Bush ley\u00f3 otro poema, \"Amazing Peace\", en la ceremonia del encendido del \u00e1rbol de Navidad en la Casa Blanca en el 2005.\n Su mismo nombre de adulta fue una reinvenci\u00f3n.  Angelou naci\u00f3 como Marguerite Johnson en San Luis y creci\u00f3 en Stamps, Arkansas, y San Francisco, entre las casas de sus padres y su abuela.  Era inteligente y fresca al punto del peligro; su familia la despach\u00f3 a California tras hablarle descaradamente al encargado blanco de una tienda en Arkansas.  Otras veces no habl\u00f3: a los 7 a\u00f1os fue violada por el novio de su madre y no pronunci\u00f3 palabra por a\u00f1os.  Aprendi\u00f3 a leer, y a escuchar.",

Hija de una enfermera y conocida frecuentadora de clubes nocturnos y un portero y cocinero de la Fuerza Naval.\n Sus padres se divorciaron pronto y luego su madre, incapaz de hacerse cargo de dos hijos peque\u00f1os, envi\u00f3 a Maya y a su hermano Bailey Junior a vivir con su abuela a Arkansas.\n El nombre de \"Maya\" se lo puso su propio hermano.  Era la forma en que degener\u00f3 su infantil forma de decir \"mi hermana\".\n Angelou pas\u00f3 los siguientes diez a\u00f1os en una de las regiones m\u00e1s pobres de EE.UU. y vivi\u00f3 de primera mano la segregaci\u00f3n racial y los prejuicios, una experiencia que llev\u00f3 al primer volumen de su autobiograf\u00eda \"S\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado\", publicada en 1970.\n A los siete a\u00f1os, en una visita a San Luis, fue violada por el novio de su madre.  Cuando le cont\u00f3 a la familia lo que hab\u00eda pasado, el hombre fue arrestado, enjuiciado, liberado y, poco despu\u00e9s, asesinado, probablemente por los t\u00edos de Angelou.\n No habl\u00f3 durante los siguientes cinco a\u00f1os.  \"Fui una muda voluntaria.  Ten\u00eda voz, pero rechazaba usarla\", record\u00f3 m\u00e1s tarde.\n \"Cuando me enter\u00e9 del asesinato, pens\u00e9 que mi voz hab\u00eda matado a un hombre, as\u00ed que no era seguro hablar.  Al poco tiempo, ya no sab\u00eda por qu\u00e9 hab\u00eda dejado de hablar, simplemente no hablaba\".\n Aunque muda, le\u00eda de forma voraz.  Termin\u00f3 siendo convencida para volver a hablar por una amiga de su abuela que, al reconocer su pasi\u00f3n por la poes\u00eda, le dijo que para experimentarla en su plenitud ten\u00eda que recitarla en voz alta.\n Angelou despu\u00e9s la cit\u00f3 diciendo: \"Nunca vas a amar la poes\u00eda hasta que realmente la sientas pasar por tu lengua y atravesar tus dientes sobre tus labios\".\n M\u00e1s tarde, se fue a vivir con su madre a San Francisco.  Tambi\u00e9n recuper\u00f3 la relaci\u00f3n con su padre, que igualmente viv\u00eda en California.\n A los 15 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 trabajar en una de las compa\u00f1\u00edas de tranv\u00edas de San Francisco, convirti\u00e9ndose en la primera mujer negra conductora.\n A los 16 a\u00f1os naci\u00f3 su \u00fanico hijo despu\u00e9s de pasar una noche con un desconocido.  Despu\u00e9s, se embarc\u00f3 en una extraordinario deambular por distintos trabajos, incluidos momentos como bailarina, camarera, prostituta y proxeneta.\n Luego se convirti\u00f3 en actriz y cantante, grab\u00f3 un disco de calipso con el que debut\u00f3 en Broadway y viaj\u00f3 por Europa.\n En el camino tuvo dos o posiblemente tres maridos -siempre adoleci\u00f3 de algo de vaguedad en el recuento de datos concretos-, y se qued\u00f3 con el apellido del primero, un aspirante a m\u00fasico griego llamado Enistasios Angelos.\n En 1961, trabaj\u00f3 durante un tiempo como la coordinadora en el norte de la Conferencia de Liderazgo Cristiano del Sur de Martin Luther King.  Luego se uni\u00f3 al activista sudafricano Vusumzi Make en El Cairo, Egipto, donde se convirti\u00f3 en periodista.\n M\u00e1s tarde, se fue con su hijo a Ghana, donde conoci\u00f3 y entabl\u00f3 amistad con el activista por los derechos de los negros Malcolm X. Regres\u00f3 a EE.UU. en 1965 para trabajar con \u00e9l, pero fue asesinado al poco tiempo.  Luther King tambi\u00e9n fue asesinado.\n \"Junto con muchos j\u00f3venes de aquel tiempo, estaba desencantada y sent\u00eda mucha rabia, protestaba por la inequidad\", le dijo a la BBC en una entrevista al recordar sus tiempos con Malcolm X y Luther King.\n \"Pero hasta que apareci\u00f3 el movimiento de derechos civiles, no hab\u00eda una forma clara de enfrentarse a las injusticias\", agreg\u00f3.\n \"Estaba segura de que podr\u00edamos conseguir una tierra donde todos, de cualquier fe religiosa, todos los Adanes y Evas, tendr\u00edan una oportunidad para permanecer bajo el sol.  Cuando los mataron a los dos, quedamos golpeados y ciegos como topos.  Fue un desastre para los afroamericanos\", dijo.\n Fue durante ese tiempo que su amigo el escritor James Baldwin la convenci\u00f3 para trabajar en el que ser\u00eda el primer volumen de su autobiograf\u00eda.  Fue un \u00e9xito de ventas.  A lo largo de la d\u00e9cada siguieron otros seis vol\u00famenes.\n Angelou comenz\u00f3 a publicar poes\u00eda tambi\u00e9n, escribi\u00f3 un guion de cine, escribi\u00f3 y present\u00f3 una serie de televisi\u00f3n sobre m\u00fasica blues y la herencia afroamericana.  Tambi\u00e9n interpret\u00f3 a la abuela de Kunta Kinte en la serie Ra\u00edces, sobre la esclavitud.\n En los a\u00f1os 80, se convirti\u00f3 en profesora universitaria en Carolina del Norte, donde en paralelo cultiv\u00f3 otra de sus muchas habilidades: la cocina.\n Para entonces ya era probablemente la escritora negra m\u00e1s famosa y una de las afroamericanas m\u00e1s conocidas de EE.UU.\nEl expresidente Bill Clinton le pidi\u00f3 que leyera un poema en su toma de posesi\u00f3n en 1993.  Titulado \"El pulso de la ma\u00f1ana\", incluye una l\u00ednea que dice, en traducci\u00f3n libre, algo as\u00ed: \"Historia, pese a su dolor desgarrador no puede ser desvivida / Pero si es enfrentada con coraje, no necesita volver a ser vivida\".\n Ocho a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, Barack Obama le otorg\u00f3 la Medalla Presidencial de la Libertad.  Por entonces, record\u00f3 que Luther King en los a\u00f1os 60 hab\u00eda predicho que EE.UU. tendr\u00eda un presidente negro en 40 a\u00f1os.\n Como no hab\u00eda cre\u00eddo que fuera posible, apoy\u00f3 la candidatura de Hillary Clinton en las primarias del Partido Dem\u00f3crata (ambas eran viejas amigas).\n Durante su vida, fue una extraordinaria creadora de frases, ten\u00eda el don de la elocuencia, con su acento sure\u00f1o y su hablar caracter\u00edsticamente lento.\n Angelou fue una figura imponente.  De todos sus logros, tal vez el m\u00e1s impresionante fue su propio car\u00e1cter.  La vida, cre\u00eda, ten\u00eda que ser vivida.  \"Lo excitante es no limitarse a sobrevivir -dijo una vez- sino crecer y crecer con algo de pasi\u00f3n, algo de compasi\u00f3n, algo de humor y algo de estilo\".",

Pero es mi intenci\u00f3n destacar el mensaje m\u00e1s directo y universal de poemas como el mencionado, en el que una mujer se muestra orgullosa y feliz con sus rasgos y aspecto a pesar de no entrar en el supuesto \"canon\" de belleza de las modelos.\n Debido a la proximidad del verano, hace meses que nos bombardean con la famosa \"operaci\u00f3n bikini\" en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n; y llevamos a\u00f1os sufriendo los dictados de una moda inhumana que nos convierte en esclavos de nuestros propios cuerpos.  Hablo en primera persona porque en la actualidad ya somos hombres y mujeres las v\u00edctimas de unas directrices que salen no se sabe muy bien de d\u00f3nde.  La anorexia y la bulimia consecuentes ya no afectan s\u00f3lo a las mujeres, sino que los especialistas nos alertan del incremento de casos en varones.  Todo ello demuestra que no hemos aprendido mucho de las reivindicaciones liberadoras feministas, sino que, m\u00e1s bien al contrario, ahora reproducimos comportamientos y sometimientos que ya deber\u00edan estar superados.\n Maya Angelou nos habl\u00f3 de una mujer cuya seguridad en s\u00ed misma proyectaba una misteriosa belleza y un poder de atracci\u00f3n que no se basaba en su aspecto externo, sino en los signos que irradiaban sus movimientos y su expresi\u00f3n.  Adem\u00e1s, se\u00f1alaba que no necesitaba ni doblegarse ni imponerse, sino mostrarse tal y como era ante el mundo.  La televisiva Oprah Winfrey, que lleg\u00f3 a mantener una estrecha amistad con la autora, ha repetido en numerosas ocasiones que la lecci\u00f3n m\u00e1s importante aportada por Angelou ha sido la de aprender a aceptarnos y a juzgarnos a nosotros mismos no por lo que somos o fuimos, sino por lo mucho que nos queda por aprender para hacer las cosas mejor.  Es aqu\u00ed donde la obra po\u00e9tica y autobiogr\u00e1fica de Maya Angelou m\u00e1s nos puede aportar.  Sirvan estas l\u00edneas como reconocimiento a una gran mujer cuyo pensamiento nos ha acompa\u00f1ado y aleccionado durante a\u00f1os.",

Hija de una enfermera y conocida frecuentadora de clubes nocturnos y un portero y cocinero de la Fuerza Naval.\n Sus padres se divorciaron pronto y luego su madre, incapaz de hacerse cargo de dos hijos peque\u00f1os, envi\u00f3 a Maya y a su hermano Bailey Junior a vivir con su abuela a Arkansas.\n El nombre de \"Maya\" se lo puso su propio hermano.  Era la forma en que degener\u00f3 su infantil forma de decir \"mi hermana\".\n Trauma personal\nAngelou pas\u00f3 los siguientes diez a\u00f1os en una de las regiones m\u00e1s pobres de EE.UU. y vivi\u00f3 de primera mano la segregaci\u00f3n racial y los perjuicios, una experiencia que llev\u00f3 al primer volumen de su autobiograf\u00eda \"S\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 canta el p\u00e1jaro enjaulado\", publicada en 1970.\n A los siete a\u00f1os, en una visita a San Luis, fue violada por el novio de su madre.  Cuando le cont\u00f3 a la familia lo que hab\u00eda pasado, el hombre fue arrestado, enjuiciado, liberado y, poco despu\u00e9s, asesinado, probablemente por los t\u00edos de Angelou.\n No habl\u00f3 durante los siguientes cinco a\u00f1os.  \"Fui una muda voluntaria.  Ten\u00eda voz, pero rechazaba usarla\", record\u00f3 m\u00e1s tarde.\n \"Cuando me enter\u00e9 del asesinato, pens\u00e9 que mi voz hab\u00eda matado a un hombre, as\u00ed que no era seguro hablar.  Al poco tiempo, ya no sab\u00eda por qu\u00e9 hab\u00eda dejado de hablar, simplemente no hablaba\".\n Carrera extraordinaria\nAunque muda, le\u00eda de forma voraz.  Termin\u00f3 siendo convencida para volver a hablar por una amiga de su abuela que, al reconocer su pasi\u00f3n por la poes\u00eda, le dijo que para experimentarla en su plenitud ten\u00eda que recitarla en voz alta.\n Angelou despu\u00e9s la cit\u00f3 diciendo: \"Nunca vas a amar la poes\u00eda hasta que realmente la sientas pasar por tu lengua y atravesar tus dientes sobre tus labios\".\n M\u00e1s tarde, se fue a vivir con su madre a San Francisco.  Tambi\u00e9n recuper\u00f3 la relaci\u00f3n con su padre, que igualmente viv\u00eda en California.\n A los 15 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 trabajar en una de las compa\u00f1\u00edas de tranv\u00edas de San Francisco, convirti\u00e9ndose en la primera mujer negra conductora.\n A los 16 a\u00f1os naci\u00f3 su \u00fanico hijo despu\u00e9s de pasar una noche con un desconocido.  Despu\u00e9s, se embarc\u00f3 en una extraordinario deambular por trabajos, incluidos momentos como bailarina, camarera, prostituta y proxeneta.\n Luego se convirti\u00f3 en actriz y cantante, grab\u00f3 un disco de calipso con el que debut\u00f3 en Broadway y viaj\u00f3 por Europa.\n En el camino tuvo dos o posiblemente tres maridos -siempre adoleci\u00f3 de algo de vaguedad en el recuento de datos concretos-, y se qued\u00f3 con el apellido del primero, un aspirante a m\u00fasico griego llamado Enistasios Angelos.\n En 1961, trabaj\u00f3 durante un tiempo como la coordinadora en el norte de la Conferencia de Liderazgo Cristiano del Sur de Martin Luther King.  Luego se uni\u00f3 al activista sudafricano Vusumzi Make en El Cairo, donde se convirti\u00f3 en periodista.",

Esta semana la muerte de Maya Angelou me entristeci\u00f3 y tambi\u00e9n me inspir\u00f3.\n El poema m\u00e1s famoso de esta mujer fenomenal se titula Aun As\u00ed Me Levanto, ( And Still I Rise) y termina as\u00ed:\n\"De las barracas de la verg\u00fcenza de la historia, yo me levanto.\n Dejando atr\u00e1s noches de temor, de terror, me levanto.\n Me levanto a un amanecer maravillosamente claro, me levanto, me levanto brindando los regalos legados por mis ancestros.  Yo soy el sue\u00f1o y la esperanza del esclavo.\n En pocas y potentes palabras el poema de Angelou resume el tema de la columna de hoy.\n Recientemente estuve en Hait\u00ed para asistir a la inauguraci\u00f3n de una escuela construida por la organizaci\u00f3n Hands on Haiti.  El viaje desde Puerto Pr\u00edncipe por una carretera ca\u00f3tica dur\u00f3 dos horas y me permiti\u00f3 ver de cerca la persistente y aplastante pobreza.\n Las carpas azules y ra\u00eddas protegiendo edificios derrumbados; las mujeres fam\u00e9licas balanceado enormes bultos en sus cabezas; los ni\u00f1os desnudos chapoteando en las aguas sucias de riachuelos que son caldo de cultivo para la epidemia de c\u00f3lera que afecta a un 6 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n; un campo est\u00e9ril sin vegetaci\u00f3n porque hasta la \u00faltima rama se utiliza para cocinar lo poco que hay de comer.\n El terremoto del 2010 fue devastador.  Pero la miseria de Hait\u00ed data de mucho antes.  Mi primer viaje al sufrido pa\u00eds fue en 1986 para cubrir el fin de la era siniestra de los Duvalier.  Recuerdo que en la plaza central de Gonaives miles de haitianos agitaban banderas cantando \"Libert\u00e9, libert\u00e9\".  Yo tambi\u00e9n me emocione pensando que estaba presenciando el hist\u00f3rico amanecer de un futuro mejor.  Obviamente no fue as\u00ed y obviamente toda la ayuda internacional que ha llegado a Hait\u00ed a ra\u00edz del terremoto no ha logrado levantar al pa\u00eds.\n M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del poblado de Saint-Marc encontramos el oasis en medio del desierto de desesperanza, el Lycee Jean- Baptiste Point du Sable, en honor al haitiano que naci\u00f3 en Saint-Marc y es reconocido oficialmente como el fundador de Chicago.  En 1770 fue el primero en construir un campamento rustico a orillas del Lago Michigan.\n La escuela que lleva su nombre es un proyecto fundado por tres magnates internacionales y financiado con donaciones de empresarios exitosos, algunos de ellos de Miami como el cubanoamericano Benny Klepach.\n Los edificios del Lycee fueron construidos con materiales reciclados bajo normas antis\u00edsmicas y anticicl\u00f3nicas.  Las aulas son amplias y frescas y bien equipadas con libros, computadoras y pupitres.  La ultima adici\u00f3n es una flamante cancha de f\u00fatbol.  Los maestros son excelentes, exigentes y dedicados.  Renee Genivieve que ense\u00f1a a los preescolares naci\u00f3 y se crio en Washington DC donde trabajaba como maestra.  Nos dice que en el Lycee vive el sue\u00f1o de todo maestro, ensenar a ni\u00f1os que verdaderamente quieren aprender.\n Alrededor de 2,000 ni\u00f1os solicitan su ingreso al Lycee cada a\u00f1o.  Solo 50 son admitidos con base en sus m\u00e9ritos acad\u00e9micos y aptitudes.  La escuela no solo les abre las puertas de una educaci\u00f3n de primera, tambi\u00e9n les da desayuno y almuerzo cada d\u00eda, libros y uniformes que mantienen impecables y atenci\u00f3n medica que incluye la visita semanal de un pediatra.  All\u00ed tambi\u00e9n aprenden la importancia de conservar y purificar el agua y participan en un proyecto de reforestaci\u00f3n.  El \u00fanico requisito es que cuando se grad\u00faen del Lycee se queden en Hait\u00ed trabajando, ense\u00f1ando y ayudando a levantar al pa\u00eds.\n La fundaci\u00f3n invierte $5,000 al a\u00f1o en cada estudiante, una cifra astron\u00f3mica en Hait\u00ed, donde el ingreso per c\u00e1pita es de menos de $500 al a\u00f1o, y m\u00e1s de lo que el estado de la Florida aporta a cada estudiante en nuestras escuelas p\u00fablicas.  Cuando inaugur\u00f3 la escuela, el presidente Martelly dijo que lo \u00fanico que puede levantar su pa\u00eds son proyectos como \u00e9ste, profundos, bien pensados y financiados a largo plazo.  El costo creciente de mantener y ampliar la misi\u00f3n del Lycee va a requerir muchas m\u00e1s donaciones.  Y no hay que ser millonaria para ayudar.  Una donaci\u00f3n de $45 al a\u00f1o cubre el costo de los libros de un estudiante, $100 d\u00f3lares al mes es suficiente para las dos comidas diarias.\n En Miami Dade hay una escuela p\u00fablica que lleva el nombre de Maya Angelou.  En Hait\u00ed hay una escuela que no lleva su nombre pero que tambi\u00e9n encarna su esp\u00edritu invencible.  Cada uno de los 300 estudiantes del Lycee Jean-Baptiste Pointe du Sable es un poema que refleja al pie de la letra el mensaje trascendental de Angelou.\n Me levanto.  Me levanto.  Me levanto, a un amanecer maravillosamente claro.",

Maya Angelou naci\u00f3 el 4 de abril de 1928 en Saint Louis, Missouri, Estados Unidos, con el nombre de Marguerite Johnson.
