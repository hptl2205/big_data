                    "body": "Pavel Golovkin / APMoscow's new Otkrytie Arena stadium, home to Spartak Moscow, is due to host some 2018 World Cup matches.\n\nDoubts were cast Wednesday over Russia's legitimacy as the host nation for football's next World Cup as Swiss authorities launched an investigation into criminal mismanagement and money laundering linked to the 2010 decision by FIFA, football's governing body, to give the 2018 sporting event to Moscow.\n\nDocuments at the Swiss headquarters of FIFA were seized and the office of Switzerland's attorney general announced it would question 10 members of the organization's 2010 executive committee, which includes Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko.\n\n\"It is suspected that irregularities occurred in the allocation of the FIFA World Cups of 2018 and 2022. The corresponding unjust enrichment is suspected to have taken place at least partly in Switzerland,\" Switzerland's attorney general said in a statement.\n\nThe Swiss investigation was launched at the same time as nine FIFA officials were arrested in a five-star Zurich hotel on the request of the U.S. Department of Justice, which announced it was carrying out a broad investigation into racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering by FIFA employees.\n\nOfficials and commentators in Moscow were quick to condemn the investigations as politically motivated. FIFA denied that there would be any changes to the venue for the next World Cup, or the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the bidding for which is also being investigated.\n\nMutko and other members of the Russian delegation to Friday's FIFA congress were staying in the same hotel as the FIFA officials who were arrested in the raid carried out at dawn on Wednesday by Swiss police.\n\n\"They [the police] are here, in the hotel, it's an unpleasant situation. For the moment there have been no questions personally for me from the Swiss police. What will happen next, I don't know,\" Mutko said Wednesday morning, according to Russian news site R-Sport.\n\nMutko, a fervent supporter of current FIFA president Sepp Blatter and one of the 16 members of FIFA's executive committee, later denied media reports that he had been summoned for questioning.\n\nRussia was awarded the 2018 World Cup after a bidding campaign that was marred by allegations of bribe-taking, spying and vote-rigging. An investigation was carried out for FIFA by former U.S. Federal Prosecutor Michael Garcia into such allegations emanating from the bids of both Russia and Qatar. FIFA refused to publish Garcia's report, citing legal concerns. Instead, the organization released a ruling last year concluding that though examples of wrongdoing had emerged, nothing was found that would require a re-vote. Garcia rejected the ruling and resigned.\n\nConstruction work in Russia is already under way for the football tournament, which will take place between June 14 and July 15 in 11 cities.\n\nOfficials in Moscow were quick to accuse Swiss and U.S. prosecutors of playing politics, pointing out that the allegations and arrests came two days before Blatter was due to face an election to win a fifth term at the head of football's top body.\n\n\"This situation could be played against Russia and against the holding of the World Cup in Russia,\" Kirill Kabanov, the head of Russia's National-Anti Corruption Committee, was cited as saying by the Russian News Service on Wednesday.\n\nOthers were more blunt, alleging that the U.S. investigation into FIFA was a response to the situation in Ukraine and Russia's increasing international assertiveness.\n\n\"It is a political move by the Americans because of what is going on in the world,\" said Yevgeny Lovchev, a prominent Soviet footballer and former candidate to lead the Russian Football Union.\n\n\"Someone is always unsatisfied and starts talking about corruption. ... Anywhere there's big money, there's corruption,\" he added.\n\nSome Western officials have called for Russia to be deprived of the World Cup because of its 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist rebels in Ukraine. Hawkish U.S. senators John McCain and Bob Menendez released a statement Wednesday calling on FIFA to elect a president who will \"work to deny the Putin regime the privilege of hosting the 2018 World Cup.\"\n\nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has estimated that the World Cup will cost Russia $20 billion -- about double what then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin predicted when Russia won the games in 2010. But other estimates put the final figure at closer to $50 billion, approximately what Russia spent on the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Brazil spent $11 billion on the last World Cup.\n\nThe earmarked money is a key source of of investment, expected to stimulate infrastructure growth and create jobs, as Russia suffers from an expected economic recession this year. Russian stock markets dropped sharply and the ruble weakened against the U.S. dollar during Wednesday morning trading following news of the Swiss investigations.\n\n\"The 2018 World Cup is one of the main public investment projects for the next three years,\" analysts at the Bank of America in Moscow said in a note to investors Wednesday.\n\nBlatter, who was not arrested Wednesday but who is facing calls to step down, has visited Russia regularly in recent months to check on preparations for the World Cup.\n\nIn April, Mutko said that Blatter had given Russia \"five stars\" for its preparations.\n\nLarge infrastructure projects in Russia often suffer from corruption allegations, and the Sochi Olympics were heavily criticized for the scale of the alleged graft. The Investigative Committee said in a statement Monday that it was opening the first corruption case against World Cup construction projects, with a building company director accused of stealing 4 million rubles ($77,000).\n\nFIFA spokesman Walter de Gregorio told reporters Wednesday that Russia would not be deprived of the World Cup and that the competition will go ahead as planned.\n\nRussia has been a staunch supporter of Blatter, despite intense criticism of the long-serving football chief. Earlier this week, Mutko announced his intention to back Blatter against Jordan's Prince Ali bin Al Hussein in an election scheduled for Friday to determine who will next lead the organization.\n\n\"I support Blatter. I understand that it's possible some sort of changes are needed but I can say one thing: compared with other international federations, FIFA is one of the most transparent and open. ... I think that today there is no alternative to Blatter,\" Mutko said Tuesday, according to R-Sport.\n\nOthers have characterized Russia's support of Blatter's FIFA as a marriage between two graft-riddled entities. The relationship between the two is extraordinarily opaque, according Yelena Panfilova, deputy director of anti-corruption organization Transparency International, which has called for Blatter's resignation.\n\n\"We don't know anything about the relationship [between Russia and FIFA] because it is so closed. ... What actually goes on, how it is all arranged, is difficult to understand,\" she said.\n\nSome of FIFA's recent anti-corruption initiatives have been forward looking and could go some way to changing football's top body, she added. \"But they can't change the past.\"",

Mutko, the Russian sports minister, said in a telephone interview from Zurich, where officials from FIFA gathered for their annual meeting.\n\n\"There have already been many investigations\" into alleged corruption in the awarding of the World Cup, Mr. Mutko said, adding that Russia would comply with Swiss law in a new investigation into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups announced by Swiss prosecutors on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Mutko led a charm offensive in 2010 to secure the right to host the quadrennial tournament in 2018. Since then, there have been questions about the propriety of Russia's bid for the tournament, and the awarding of the 2022 tournament to Qatar.\n\nAlso, the United States and its European allies have sought to isolate Russia with sanctions after its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the conflict in southeast Ukraine. The World Cup has taken on added significance for Russians intent on projecting their international standing.\n\n\"If I thought about them canceling the World Cup, then I was a little bit worried about the political sanctions, that somehow they would interfere,\" said Viktor Gusev, one of the country's most famous soccer commentators. \"But because of a corruption scandal in FIFA? I did not imagine it.\"\n\nIt seemed that Russia was in the clear last November, when a FIFA investigation reaffirmed the country's right to host the World Cup after an investigation into allegations of corruption the bid process. (An investigator called the country's delegation \"highly uncooperative\" but Russia did not lose the right to host.)\n\nRussian state television, which consistently promotes hawkish political commentary, said on Wednesday that the indictment may be a United States plot to destroy Russia's World Cup dream.\n\n\"FIFA held an internal investigation into the vote over the hosting of the 2018 World Cup and did not find violations,\" a reporter said Wednesday on the Rossiya-24 channel. \"So American authorities decided to act using intimidation and blackmail.\"\n\nThe Rossiya-24 report also said the arrests in Zurich on an indictment in an American court were tied to demands by two United States senators, including John McCain, the Republican known in Russia for his animosity toward President Vladimir V. Putin, that Sepp Blatter be deposed as FIFA president because he awarded Russia the World Cup.\n\nMr. Mutko declined to assign a political motive to the United States investigation, calling it \"conjecture,\" but many other politicians took to the national airwaves to denounce Wednesday's arrests.\n\n\"The goal is much broader then just to take away the World Cup hosting from us,\" said Nikolai Levichev, a Russian lawmaker, on the channel NTV. \"They will try to smear and discredit Russia in the eyes of the world community.\"\n\nAs to Mr. Blatter, the embattled FIFA president, it turned out he also had friends in the Russian State Duma.\n\n\"It's probably not an accident that these arrests took place two days before the election of the FIFA president but I do not think they will affect the outcome,\" meaning a win for Mr. Blatter, said Igor Ananskikh, the head of the parliamentary committee on sport and physical education, according to the Interfax news agency. \"Under Blatter the federation has become stronger, many new members have joined, and profits have grown.\"\n\nA Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman on Wednesday protested United States law enforcement's actions in Switzerland. \"Without going into details about the accusations, we bring attention to this latest incident of the illegal, extraterritorial application of United States law,\" he said.",

Early that morning, police in Switzerland complied with a U.S. request to arrest nine senior officials at FIFA, the sport's governing body, as part of a far-reaching probe into decades of alleged bribe-taking and backroom deals.\n\nBut why, the Russians asked, would a nation as indifferent to soccer as the U.S. pursue a corruption probe at the heart of the game? Even more suspect to many in Moscow was the timing of the dragnet in Zurich: The next FIFA World Cup tournament is due to be held in Russia in 2018, and President Vladimir Putin has been overseeing the preparations personally.\n\n\"So there are clearly forces in America that are trying to turn anything positive that we have into a new channel of confrontation,\" Kirill Kabanov, who monitors corruption in Russia as a member of the Kremlin's council on civil society, told TIME on Wednesday. \"And even if there was bribery going on [at FIFA], why would the Americans only bring it up now, just after FIFA refused the demands of [U.S.] Senators to revoke Russia's right to host the champions?\"\n\nHis question referred to an appeal that 13 U.S. Senators sent last month to the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, asking him to move the 2018 World Cup to another country. After Putin decided last spring to invade and annex Ukraine's Crimea region, \"allowing Russia to host the FIFA World Cup inappropriately bolsters the prestige of the Putin regime at a time when it should be condemned,\" the Senators wrote in the letter, which was dated April 1.\n\nLess than three weeks later, Blatter met with Putin in the Russian resort city of Sochi and issued an apparent rebuttal to the appeals from Capitol Hill. \"If politicians are not too happy that we are taking the World Cup to Russia, I always say to them, 'Well, you can stay home, and in Russia we will hold the biggest world cup ever,'\" the FIFA chief told Putin on April 20, according to a transcript on the Kremlin website.\n\nPutin responded with a promise that day: \"We will at the very least achieve one objective and will organize this big event in Russia,\" he said. But the President had no comment on the unfolding firestorm in Switzerland on Wednesday. \"This is not our issue,\" the Kremlin said through a spokesman. And indeed, no Russian citizens were among the 14 people indicted by the Eastern District of New York, including two FIFA vice-presidents.\n\nThe acting U.S. Attorney in the case, however, made clear that the probe was far from over: \"This indictment is not the final chapter in our investigation,\" Kelly Currie told reporters in New York.\n\nSwiss authorities then gave another sign that Russia could yet become a target.\n\nAs part of a separate investigation, the Attorney General of Switzerland said investigators had also raided FIFA's headquarters in Zurich on Wednesday, seizing a trove of documents related to FIFA's decision in December 2010 to award Russia and Qatar the rights to host the next two World Cup tournaments. These files would be used as evidences in \"criminal proceedings against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 Football World Cups,\" the Swiss Attorney General said in a statement.\n\nAsked at a crowded news conference on Wednesday whether these tournaments could be under threat, FIFA's spokesman insisted that both would carry on as planned. \"Russia and Qatar will be played,\" said the spokesman, Walter de Gregorio. \"This is what is fact today. I don't go into speculation about what will happen tomorrow.\"\n\nIn the coming days, the Russian official most likely to face scrutiny over this scandal would seem to be Vitaly Mutko, Putin's Minister of Sport. In 2009, FIFA elected him to its main decision-making body, the Executive Committee, and the following year, Mutko became the driving force behind Russia's bid to host the 2018 World Cup.\n\nThe legality of that bid's success is now a key focus of the Swiss investigation. But as Mutko told reporters on Wednesday, \"We have nothing to hide.\" Despite media reports to the contrary, he said, Swiss investigators had not asked to question him in relation to their case: \"This is not related to the [Russian] campaign to host the world championships.\"\n\nBut some of Mutko's peers in Moscow were not so ready to profess Russia's innocence, at least not in any investigation where the U.S. plays a role. \"The Americans can investigate whatever and however they want,\" says Viacheslav Fetisov, the Russian hockey legend who served as Russia's top sporting official under Putin from 2004 until 2008. \"So we'll just have to see what they come up with,\" he tells TIME in a phone interview.\n\nEven more measured was the response from Vasily Shestakov, who was Putin's friend and sparring partner in the 1960s, when they were both teenagers studying judo at the same gym in Leningrad. Now a member of the Russian parliament's committee on sport, Shestakov admits that in the world of international soccer, \"There is very big money swirling around. Temptation is unavoidable.\" And in the upper echelons of FIFA, \"there may have been an element of corruption,\" he told Russia's state news agency on Wednesday.\n\nWhat bothers him, though, is the fact that the U.S. is pursuing this case against corruption now, of all times, just as Russia prepares to host the premier tournament of global sports. What if the roles had been reversed, he wondered. What if the U.S. had been chosen to host one of the upcoming World Cup championships? To Shestakov the answer seemed clear: \"There would never have been any of these arrests.\"\n\nSign up for THE BRIEF and more view example",

USA TODAY\n\n78 CONNECT 3 TWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin lashed out at the United States on Thursday, accusing it of meddling in global soccer amid an unprecedented corruption scandal.\n\nIn televised comments, Putin called the U.S. involvement in the FIFA investigation \"strange\" and said the country was overstepping its power amid growing concerns, especially that of Russia's, that the scandal could affect that country's hosting of the 2018 World Cup.\n\nCorruption charges were announced Wednesday in the U.S. against 14 FIFA officials and sports executives. Seven were arrested in Switzerland. The allegations include racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering and bribery, and relate to at least two generations of soccer officials who are accused of acquiring millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFIFA officials arrested on corruption charges\n\nSpeaking to journalists Thursday, Putin called the probe \"a clear attempt to keep Mr. (Sepp) Blatter from being re-elected as president of FIFA,\" according to an official statement on the Kremlin's website. Blatter is expected to win a fifth term Friday.\n\n\"This is a blatant violation of the principle of how international organizations function,\" Putin said. \"We are aware of the pressure that he was subjected to in relation to Russia holding the 2018 World Cup.\"\n\nPutin compared the United States' involvement in the case to the persecution of whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. He accused the U.S. of overstepping its \"jurisdiction,\" saying it was \"strange\" that Washington had requested the arrests when the crimes did not involve U.S. citizens and did not happen in the country.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIn Brazil, FIFA scandal met with sense of vindication\n\nHis comments were the latest example of growing tensions between the two nations, following Russia's annexation of Crimea last year and its backing of rebels in Ukraine.\n\nPutin's successes in securing Russia's bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup were seen as some of the top achievements of his administration among Russians.\n\nRussia's Foreign Ministry called the arrests of FIFA officials \"illegal\" and called on Washington to \"stop trying to hold court far beyond your own borders using your own legal norms and (instead) adhere to accepted international legal procedure,\" according to an official statement from Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich posted on the ministry's website.\n\nSwiss prosecutors said Thursday they planned to question 10 FIFA executive committee members who were with the organization in 2010, when voting took place that awarded Russia the World Cup in 2018 and Qatar the tournament in 2022.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSoccer fans not surprised: FIFA scandal is 'business as usual'\n\nRussia's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who is one of the members, said he did not receive any invitation for questioning, Russia's sports news agency, R-Sport, reported Thursday.\n\nMutko did however fly to Switzerland on Wednesday, but said it was not related to the case.\n\n\"The FIFA executive committee is here, the Congress is supposed to take place here, and the president of FIFA is going to be elected tomorrow. As a member of the executive committee I am involved in these events,\" Mutko said, according to Russia's RSN agency.\n\nAsked about the possibility of Russia losing its host status for the 2018 World Cup, he said there were no reasons for this to happen.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup is coming up too soon for Russia to likely lose its bid, local sports commentators say, but it is a possibility, particularly if Blatter is not re-elected.\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLax Swiss laws led to less scrutiny of FIFA\n\n\"Right now FIFA is saying that the World Cup will stay in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. But that could begin to look increasingly shaky if and when more revelations emerge,\" said Marc Bennets, a Moscow-based journalist and the author of Football Dynamo, a book about Russia's soccer culture.\n\n\"Putin certainly believes in a U.S.-led plot to harm Russia, and so it's not surprising that he has spoken out. He personally backed Russia's bid for the 2018 World Cup, and it would be seen as a big blow if Russia was to now lose it,\" he added.\n\nFor Russia to lose its bid, \"a court would have to order a new bidding process. But that would only be possible if there was overwhelming evidence of corruption involved with Russia's bid,\" Bennets said. \"Sepp Blater would be loath to do this though, but his position could be under real threat soon.\"\n\n78 CONNECT 3 TWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE",

It was all planned beforehand\" to coincide with Blatter's reelection effort.\n\nChukhry warned that the investigation could threaten Russia and Qatar's host status: \"After all, all the independent investigations that have been conducted in the last two years linked to accusations by the English, have also touched Russia.\"\n\n\"Looks like that's it,\" wrote \"Vsyo Plokho\" (Everything Is Bad):\n\n\"My reaction to the FIFA scandal,\" wrote Mysli Persidenta:\n\nRussian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny wrote simply, \"Oops,\" as it became clear the Swiss investigation would touch on Russia's 2018 championships:\n\nOthers bristled at the notion, mooted by, among others, United States Senator John McCain, that Russia's host status should be revoked.\n\nRussian-language Twitter user \"HigherCause\" reveled in a FIFA statement that appeared to affirm Russia would remain host of the 2018 event.\n\n\"FIFA sent McCain off on erotic travels with his requests to take WC-2018 from Russia\":\n\nIn comments carried by news agencies, Russian State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh said the investigation \"in no way concerns Russia directly. All the talk that Russia could lose its host status for World Cup 2018 is completely unfounded.\"\n\nBut the satirists were out in force, joking that Russia wasted its money on bribes to get the World Cup and had been found out.\n\nFake_MIDRF, a satirical account posing as the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote: \"The money we took from pensioners, orphans, the sick ndash; and gave to greedy bureaucrats at FIFA, was spent in vain.\":\n\n\"We protest against the brazen interference of the U.S. prosecutor in Russia's internal affairs in FIFA.\":\n\nPavel Chikov, the chairman of the Agora human rights association, on Twitter zeroed in on recent proposals from the State Duma that the country to build infrastructure at the World Cup.\n\n\"They got the soccer World Cup with a bribe, then forced prisoners to build the stadiums, and stole the money.\":\n\nMeanwhile, some Russians rallied around FIFA President Sepp Blatter despite a posted on May 26 which found that almost four out of five football fans believe he shouldn't seek reelection.\n\n\"America, don't touch Blatter. Whatever he's like, and he's family,\" Roman Trushechkin, a football commentator and sports journalist, wrote on Twitter:\n\n\"I hope that Blatter wins the presidential elections and almost don't doubt that he will manage now. These morons really don't know how to work.\":\n\nLawmaker Ananskikh joined the well-wishers: \"It is probably not a coincidence that the arrests have happened two days before the FIFA presidential elections, but, having said that, I don't think that they will influence the results of the elections. If Blatter takes part in them, he will of course win.\"\n\nOther Twitter users joined in the international criticism of Blatter.\n\n\"Joseph Blat,\" wrote Innostrany Agent (Foreign Agent), punning on Blatter's name and \"blat,\" the Russian word for crony connections:\n\nVsyo Plokho mocked Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko over his English-language skills after reports -- later denied by Mutko -- that he had been summoned for questioning in Switzerland.\n\n\"Ai dont nou enisink ebaut korapshan in FIFA.\":\n\nAn English-language parody account of Vladimir Putin alluded to how an inquiry in November into the awarding of the 2018 World Cup bid hit a dead-end after Russia it used for its bid and could not provide evidence.\n\nFIFA: the planned world championship in Russia will take place.

Not long after U.S. authorities announced their role in pursuing the arrest of seven FIFA officials in the Swiss city of Zurich, Russia's foreign ministry issued an angry statement.\n\n\"Without going into the details of the proposed charges, we would turn attention to the fact that this is another case of illegal extraterritorial application of US laws. We hope that this will in no way be used to tarnish the international football organization in general and its decisions, including personnel,\" read the statement, posted on the Russian foreign ministry's Web site.\n\n\"Once again, we urge Washington to stop trying to administer justice far beyond its borders under its legal regulations and to follow the generally accepted international legal procedures,\" it added.\n\nOn Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin echoed these comments, deeming the timing of the move \"odd\" and another sign of American methods to \"illegally persecute people.\"\n\n[Was Putin right about Syria?]\n\nMoscow, of course, has a long history of decrying American interventionism.\n\nBut in this instance, the expanding U.S. and Swiss investigations into FIFA hit rather close to home. Russia is set to host the 2018 World Cup, which it was awarded in controversial circumstances alongside Qatar's 2022 bid. The bidding for these tournaments are now apparently the subject of federal scrutiny, and there are even suggestions (perhaps more wishful than real) that subsequent revelations could lead to the tournaments' relocation.\n\nThis dovetails with an ongoing diplomatic feud between Russia and the West over the 2018 World Cup. Since Russia's annexation of Crimea last year, and continued meddling in eastern Ukraine, there's been a growing chorus of European officials calling for either a boycott of the tournament or for FIFA to reconsider its choice of Russia altogether.\n\nThat's been echoed across the Atlantic as well. Last month, 13 U.S. senators wrote a letter to FIFA, asking it to strip Russia off the World Cup because it \"inappropriately bolsters the prestige\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"regime at a time it when it should be condemned.\"\n\nThis was noted in Moscow, and was likely on the minds of some Russian officials on Wednesday. \"There are clearly forces in America that are trying to turn anything positive that we have into a new channel of confrontation,\" Kirill Kabanov, a member of the Kremlin's council on civil society, told Time magazine's Simon Shuster. \"And even if there was bribery going on [at FIFA], why would the Americans only bring it up now, just after FIFA refused the demands of [U.S.] Senators to revoke Russia's right to host the champions?\"\n\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter, now in the eye of the storm, has resolutely stood by the Russian and Qatari World Cup bids.

Not long after U.S. authorities announced their role in pursuing the arrest of seven FIFA officials in the Swiss city of Zurich, Russia's foreign ministry issued an angry statement.\n\n\"Without going into the details of the proposed charges, we would turn attention to the fact that this is another case of illegal extraterritorial application of US laws. We hope that this will in no way be used to tarnish the international football organization in general and its decisions, including personnel,\" read the statement, posted on the Russian foreign ministry's Web site.\n\n\"Once again, we urge Washington to stop trying to administer justice far beyond its borders under its legal regulations and to follow the generally accepted international legal procedures,\" it added.\n\n[Was Putin right about Syria?]\n\nMoscow, of course, has a long history of decrying American interventionism.\n\nBut in this instance, the expanding U.S. and Swiss investigations into FIFA hit rather close to home. Russia is set to host the 2018 World Cup, which it was awarded in controversial circumstances alongside Qatar's 2022 bid. The bidding for these tournaments are now apparently the subject of federal scrutiny, and there are even suggestions (perhaps more wishful than real) that subsequent revelations could lead to the tournaments' relocation.\n\nThis dovetails with an ongoing diplomatic feud between Russia and the West over the 2018 World Cup. Since Russia's annexation of Crimea last year, and continued meddling in eastern Ukraine, there's been a growing chorus of European officials calling for either a boycott of the tournament or for FIFA to reconsider its choice of Russia altogether.\n\nThat's been echoed across the Atlantic as well. Last month, 13 U.S. senators wrote a letter to FIFA, asking it to strip Russia off the World Cup because it \"inappropriately bolsters the prestige\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"regime at a time it when it should be condemned.\"\n\nThis was noted in Moscow, and was likely on the minds of some Russian officials on Wednesday. \"There are clearly forces in America that are trying to turn anything positive that we have into a new channel of confrontation,\" Kirill Kabanov, a member of the Kremlin's council on civil society, told Time magazine's Simon Shuster. \"And even if there was bribery going on [at FIFA], why would the Americans only bring it up now, just after FIFA refused the demands of [U.S.] Senators to revoke Russia's right to host the champions?\"\n\nFIFA had indeed refused those American demands. \"History has shown so far that boycotting sport events or a policy of isolation or confrontation are not the most effective ways to solve problems,\" a FIFA spokeswoman told the Associated Press last month, adding that the tournament \"can be a powerful catalyst for constructive dialogue between people and governments, helping to bring positive social developments.\"\n\nThat's a questionable assertion.

The stadium's interior will become a state-of-the-art space for 80,000 soccer fans, but the exterior will maintain its original appearance after renovation.\n\nHammering, digging, painting and pouring cement: work continues on the 221,000-square-meter area - a fact construction director Murat Ahmadiev is very proud of.\n\n\"This is where the heart of the World Cup will beat,\" he told DW, adding that he cannot imagine the project will be terminated because of the FIFA corruption scandal. \"Despite the troubles our country has, we are making good progress.

While the West demands consequences for FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who was re-elected on Friday, with regard to the football organization's current scandal, Russia's president suspects a US conspiracy against Russia and states.\n\n\"We know that he [Blatter] has been put under pressure to take the 2018 World Cup away from Russia,\" President Vladimir Putin said. \"This again, is obviously a US attempt to infiltrate other countries with its legal system.\"\n\nRussian Sports Minister and FIFA Executive Committee member Vitaly Mutko praised the world soccer governing body. The Russian newspaper \"Kommersant\" cited his confidence in FIFA as a \"good organization.\" The Russian Football Union fully supports Sepp Blatter and Russia is not under threat of losing the World Cup in three years, the paper reported.\n\nMutko himself was interrogated in Zurich but not on corruption allegations, as he asserted to the TASS news agency. According to Mutko, the arrests in Zurich were not related to the World Cup in Russia and that the country honestly earned the right to host the World Cup in 2018.\n\nFaithful Russian sponsor\n\nValery Fedoreev, a legal specialist for sports who heads the Russian office of the international law firm CMS, shared Mutko's view and said FIFA should expect a bill from Russia if the 2018 tournament were to be moved.\n\n\"I am sure that it is clear to FIFA if they cancel, they will receive an invoice for astronomical compensation demands, all of which are monetary sums that have already been spent to expand soccer infrastructures,\" Fedoreev told DW.\n\nAlthough the five main World Cup sponsors: Adidas, Coca Cola, Hyundai, McDonald's and Anheuser Busch have expressed concern about the investigations and a further cooperation, the Russian energy giant Gazprom remains devoted to the event. Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said FIFA's current problems would have no impact on sponsorship agreements.\n\nA football fete\n\nMany Muscovites seem indifferent to the news from Zurich and the comments their government and sport officials make. They only want one thing: a big soccer party in their country.\n\n\"I'm sure it could happen, but I really do not think anybody wants to take the World Cup away from us,\" a student called Sasha and said. \"After all, we are a peace-loving country and everyone should see that!\"\n\nSvetlana, a pensioner, added, \"This organizers' scandal has nothing to do with our country. They can't just cancel our party!\"\n\nAlmost 2,000 people continue working around the clock on the Luzhniki stadium site and hope their labor is not in vain.",

Russians can live without imported foods and Turkish vacations, but they may not tolerate being branded as a rogue nation not deserving a World Cup.\n\nFIFA, the international federation of soccer, chooses the venue of the quadrennial World Cup by a vote of its directors. Competition among applicants is intense, and the lobbying is extreme. Russia was selected as the 2018 host country by FIFA in December 2010 when a beaming Vladimir Putin and FIFA's four-term president, Sepp Blatter, congratulated each other.\n\nFIFA has valuable assets to peddle, but they come at a price. FIFA has a reputation for corruption and scandal as it allots venues for the various soccer cups, the most important being the World Cup. FIFA critics question why Russia (2018) and Qatar (2022), with their questionable human rights reputations, were selected, especially after experts rated their proposals as among the weakest. When Russia won the 2018 event, British tabloids complained that Britain had lost to a \"mafia state.\"\n\nThings may be changing.\n\nThe US Justice Department has ordered the arrest and extradition to the United States of fourteen defendants associated with FIFA, including two of its vice presidents, who are charged with racketeering and corruption. The Justice Department has pledged to end FIFA's \"corrupt practices,\" citing $150 million in bribes and kickbacks that have flowed through the US financial system. Swiss justice officials are coordinating with the US Justice Department. The European media are flooded with reports of bribes and under-the-table dealings of FIFA officers.\n\nThe Justice Department action has lent weight to the demand of thirteen prominent US senators, dated April 1, to FIFA president Blatter to relocate the 2018 World Cup from Moscow to a less controversial venue. A anti-FIFA documentary highlighted on German television discloses the criminal wheelings and dealings associated with Russia's successful bid for the World Cup, including a lucrative deal offered by Russia's Gazprom to a Cyprus businessman, who just happens to be one of FIFA's voting vice presidents, and its hiring of German soccer legend, Franz Beckenbauer, as its \"sports diplomat.\"\n\nKremlin propaganda has shifted into high gear. In an on-camera interview, Russia's World Cup representative expressed surprise that the \"armed conflict\" in Ukraine could be considered a reason to relocate the 2018 World Cup. He intoned disdainfully that Russia has no involvement in Ukraine and that the Minsk Peace accord, brokered by Russia, has ended the conflict. Thus, he said, Russia's only role in Ukraine is that of a peacemaker. Russia's sports minister rushed before the cameras to declare that \"Russia has nothing to hide.\" Blatter declared that \"there are no boycotts\" in international soccer and that \"football [soccer] is an instrument of peace.\"\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue",

But those two didn't actually vote for Russia. Could you explain who might be interested in that?\n\nAlexey Sorokin: The way we see it and the way we read it in the FIFA press release, first of all the indictment and these apprehensions have nothing to do with the bids, with the voting for host countries of 2018 and 2022. The people who are implicated were not the Executive Committee (ExCo) members at the time of the vote. So they could not possibly have anything to do with the host country selection process. This is a totally separate investigation. We don't see any involvement or any concern of the World Cup in general.\n\nRT: So the 2018 World Cup will not be in any way affected by this affair?\n\nAS: No, it won't be affected. There is another investigation that is going on in Switzerland as we lately understood. This investigation has to do with the voting process, with the process of selection of the host countries. But again we have no information about the progress of this investigation. We did cooperate with the last investigation done by [former US attorney Michael] Garcia, we cooperated, submitted all the information. We don't know how else we can help any investigator who is interested in that.\n\nREAD MORE: 'We are the damaged party': FIFA vows to go on with World Cup plans despite scandal\n\nRT: For fans who are anxious about the outcome of the 2018 World Cup and whether or not it will actually materialize - could you speak to the fears that it may not materialize because of this affair?\n\nAS: Not only could it materialize, it's materializing as we speak. We are very deep in the preparation process. FIFA is fully satisfied by the course of preparation. We have a very good level of cooperation with the FIFA administration. We don't know how anything that goes on around the world of football can affect the preparation.\n\nRT: Do you feel the reputational risk of this affair that is unfolding? Do you feel that the 2018 World Cup will be insulated from this reputational risk?\n\nAS: I don't think so. It's a classic legal matter, which should be addressed exactly as such. So we should separate the image of the organization... By the way FIFA is participating as an injured side in this investigation. Authorities should treat it as purely legal matter. I don't know what possible negative consequences it should have for us.\n\nRT: Do you have any fears about the politicization of FIFA and World Football?\n\nAS: FIFA as well as other sport organizations has always claimed that sport is beyond politics. I think we should adhere to this principle and as much as we adhere to that, it serves the benefit of any sport. The ideal situation is that we think about sport, athletes, results and not about politics.\n\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.",

Los Mundiales de F\u00fatbol de 2018 y 2022 se celebrar\u00e1n en Rusia y Catar, respectivamente, sedes que fueron elegidas en un ceremonia en Z\u00farich en diciembre de 2010, y que ya en su d\u00eda fueron rodeadas de pol\u00e9mica por sospechas de corrupci\u00f3n.\n\nLa Fiscal\u00eda ha informado de que el proceso penal se abri\u00f3 el pasado mes de marzo \"por sospechas de irregularidades cometidas durante la atribuci\u00f3n de las Copas del Mundo de f\u00fatbol de la FIFA de 2018 y 2022\".

Adem\u00e1s, la fiscal\u00eda indica que \"existen sospechas de blanqueo de dinero a trav\u00e9s de relaciones bancarias en Suiza\".\n\nEn el comunicado, la fiscal\u00eda deja claro que la FIFA ha colaborado esta ma\u00f1ana y ha entregado los documentos que se le han demandado sin oposici\u00f3n.
