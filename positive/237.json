                    "body": "The shape of the moon deviates from a simple sphere in ways that scientists have struggled to explain. A new study by researchers at UC Santa Cruz shows that most of the moon's overall shape can be explained by taking into account tidal effects acting early in the moon's history.\n\nThe results, published July 30 in Nature, provide insights into the moon's early history, its orbital evolution, and its current orientation in the sky, according to lead author Ian Garrick-Bethell, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nAs the moon cooled and solidified more than 4 billion years ago, the sculpting effects of tidal and rotational forces became frozen in place. The idea of a frozen tidal-rotational bulge, known as the \"fossil bulge\" hypothesis, was first described in 1898. \"If you imagine spinning a water balloon, it will start to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator,\" Garrick-Bethell explained. \"On top of that you have tides due to the gravitational pull of the Earth, and that creates sort of a lemon shape with the long axis of the lemon pointing at the Earth.\"\n\nBut this fossil bulge process cannot fully account for the current shape of the moon. In the new paper, Garrick-Bethell and his coauthors incorporated other tidal effects into their analysis. They also took into account the large impact basins that have shaped the moon's topography, and they considered the moon's gravity field together with its topography.\n\nEfforts to analyze the moon's overall shape are complicated by the large basins and craters created by powerful impacts that deformed the lunar crust and ejected large amounts of material. \"When we try to analyze the global shape of the moon using spherical harmonics, the craters are like gaps in the data,\" Garrick-Bethell said. \"We did a lot of work to estimate the uncertainties in the analysis that result from those gaps.\"\n\nTheir results indicate that variations in the thickness of the moon's crust caused by tidal heating during its formation can account for most of the moon's large-scale topography, while the remainder is consistent with a frozen tidal-rotational bulge that formed later.\n\nA previous paper by Garrick-Bethell and some of the same coauthors described the effects of tidal stretching and heating of the moon's crust at a time 4.4 billion years ago when the solid outer crust still floated on an ocean of molten rock. Tidal heating would have caused the crust to be thinner at the poles, while the thickest crust would have formed in the regions in line with the Earth. Published in Science in 2010, the earlier study found that the shape of one area of unusual topography on the moon, the lunar farside highlands, was consistent with the effects of tidal heating during the formation of the crust.\n\n\"In 2010, we found one area that fits the tidal heating effect, but that study left open the rest of the moon and didn't include the tidal-rotational deformation. In this paper we tried to bring all those considerations together,\" Garrick-Bethell said.\n\nTidal heating and tidal-rotational deformation had similar effects on the moon's overall shape, giving it a slight lemon shape with a bulge on the side facing the Earth and another bulge on the opposite side. The two processes left distinct signatures, however, in the moon's gravity field. Because the crust is lighter than the underlying mantle, gravity signals reveal variations in the thickness of the crust that were caused by tidal heating.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers found that the moon's overall gravity field is no longer aligned with the topography, as it would have been when the tidal bulges were frozen into the moon's shape. The principal axis of the moon's overall shape (the long axis of the lemon) is now separated from the gravity principal axis by about 34 degrees. (Excluding the large basins from the data, the difference is still about 30 degrees.)\n\n\"The moon that faced us a long time ago has shifted, so we're no longer looking at the primordial face of the moon,\" Garrick-Bethell said. \"Changes in the mass distribution shifted the orientation of the moon. The craters removed some mass, and there were also internal changes, probably related to when the moon became volcanically active.\"\n\nThe details and timing of these processes are still uncertain. But Garrick-Bethell said the new analysis should help efforts to work out the details of the moon's early history. While the new study shows that tidal effects can account for the overall shape of the moon, tidal processes don't explain the topographical differences between the near side and the far side.",

The crust solidified, but the moon's center was still largely molten.\n\nAccording to The New York Times: \"Efforts to pinpoint the moon's exact shape have long been stymied by the presence of large craters on its surface that formed after the crust solidified. There have also been inconsistencies between its measurements and what we know about its past.\"\n\nThe Times says:\n\n\"To overcome the crater problem, [Garrick-Bethell] and his colleagues used highly accurate maps of the moon's topography, made with a laser altimeter, then ran calculations to see what the surface could have looked like before the craters formed.\n\n\"The measurements that emerged help explain how the moon acquired its shape, the researchers say. Its squashed appearance is probably a result of the gravitational process called tidal heating or acceleration, which stretched the moon's crust as it was being formed. The equatorial bulge probably dates to a later period, when the moon was still spinning but was slowing down and moving away from earth, freezing a tidal surge in place.\"\n\nThe BBC says Garrick-Bethell and his team were inspired by similar research in a 2013 study by researchers from the University of Texas at Austin. They calculated how tidal heating caused by Jupiter's massive tug was causing warmer water under the ice crust on Europa.\n\nCopyright 2014 NPR.",

                    "body": "Researchers from UC Santa Cruz have finally solved the mystery behind the moon's changing shapes. Findings of the study provided significant insight into the moon's early history and orbital evolution.\n\nStudy leader Ian Garrick-Bethell, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, worked with colleagues to revisit the theory of \"fossil bulge\" and integrated tidal effects to see how the combination would affect the moon's overall shape. The team also factored in their analysis large impact basins known to alter the moon's topography.\n\n\"If you imagine spinning a water balloon, it will start to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator,\" Garrick-Bethell explained. \"On top of that, you have tides due to the gravitational pull of the Earth, and that creates sort of a lemon shape with the long axis of the lemon pointing at the Earth.\"\n\nScientists have struggled to study the moon's overall shape due to various impact basins on the moon. These craters have deformed the lunar crust and ejected large amounts of material resulting in variant pieces of research data.\n\nAfter careful analysis, researchers concluded that the changes in the moon's shape are caused by tidal heating on its poles and frozen tidal-rotational bulges on the remainder of the surface. Due to tidal heating, the poles of the moon become thinner, while the regions facing the Earth have become thicker.\n\nIn addition, the researchers observed a misalignment in the moon's overall gravity field and topography by 34 degrees.\n\n\"The moon that faced us a long time ago has shifted, so we're no longer looking at the primordial face of the moon,\" Garrick-Bethell said. \"Changes in the mass distribution shifted the orientation of the moon. The craters removed some mass, and there were also internal changes, probably related to when the moon became volcanically active.\"\n\nAuthors of the study admitted that further research is needed to outline the moon's early history and explain the topographical differences between the near and far sides of the moon.",

                    "body": "Earth's powerful gravity tugged the moon into its oddball shape long ago, shortly after both bodies formed, a new study suggests.\n\nTidal forces exerted during the early days of the solar system can explain most of the moon's large-scale topography, including its slight lemon shape, reports the study, which was published online today (July 30) in the journal Nature.\n\nThe new findings could help scientists tackle longstanding lunar mysteries, such as why the moon's near side is dominated by dark volcanic deposits, while the far side is not, researchers said. [How the Moon Formed: A Timeline (Gallery)]\n\n\"What is the origin of that asymmetry?\" study lead author Ian Garrick-Bethell, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said. \"Chipping away at this problem of the shape of the moon can give us insight into those types of fundamental geology problems,\" he told Space.com.\n\nA young, molten moon\n\nScientists think the moon formedfrom debris blasted into space when a mysterious planet-size body slammed into the young Earth about 4.5 billion years ago. The moon was born hot, and it came into existence quite close to our home planet. (The moon has been slowly spiraling away ever since.)\n\nThe newborn moon was thus primed to be sculpted by Earth's gravity, and that's exactly what happened, researchers say.\n\nIndeed, scientists have posited for more than a century that tidal forces helped shape the molten moon, causing bulges that froze into place when Earth's natural satellite cooled down and solidified. But the new study provides a much more detailed understanding of how this likely happened.\n\nGarrick-Bethell and his team studied topographic data gathered by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and information about the moon's gravity field collected by the agency's twin GRAIL (Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory) spacecraft. Though the researchers took a global view of the moon, they focused on areas outside of the body's biggest impact craters, which can complicate such analyses.\n\nThe data strongly implicate tidal effects as a key shaper of the moon, researchers said. For example, tidal forces pulled on the lunar crust, stretching it out and heating it up in places. This process thinned out the crust at the lunar poles and thickened it in the regions that lined up with Earth, helping sculpt the moon into a lemon with two small bulges (one on the side facing our planet, and one on the side directly opposite).\n\nSuch tidal heating could have occurred only when the moon's crust was floating on a sea of molten rock, largely decoupled from the rest of the body, Garrick-Bethell said.\n\n\"This happened a long time ago, when the moon was not completely solid,\" he said. \"This was in the first 100 to 200 million years of lunar thermal evolution.\"\n\nAlso contributing to the moon's overall shape were more straightforward tidal deformations, which Garrick-Bethell likened to squeezing the lemon with your hands, and rotational forces, which cause spinning bodies such as the moon to flatten at the poles and bulge out near the equator.\n\nWhen the moon cooled, the changes wrought by all of these processes were frozen in place.\n\nInterestingly, the long axis of the moon doesn't point directly toward Earth as it likely did long ago; instead, it's offset by about 30 degrees. This probably happened when volcanic activity, impact cratering and other events made the moon's interior a much less homogeneous place, researchers said.\n\n\"Internal density anomalies have formed, and they've kind of canted the moon,\" Garrick-Bethell said. \"At some point in lunar history, you have these events that took place that caused these density anomalies and shifted the density axis away from the shape axis.\"\n\nUnderstanding other moons and planets\n\nThe new results could have applications beyond the moon, potentially helping researchers better understand any celestial body strongly affected by tidal forces, Garrick-Bethell said.\n\n\"This idea was inspired by Europa,\" he said, referring to the huge moon of Jupiter. Europa is similar today to Earth's moon long ago, he added, in that it harbors a solid shell (of ice in Europa's case rather than rock) sitting atop an ocean layer (which consists of liquid water rather than magma).\n\nThe study could even yield insights about the evolution of faraway alien planets, Garrick-Bethell said.\n\n\"Tides are so ubiquitous; they're everywhere across the galaxy,\" he said. \"So understanding tidal processes is always important.\"\n\nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

                    "body": "When we look up at the night sky and see the moon, we see what we believe is a perfectly round object. However, scientists recently discovered that the moon is not spherical, but shaped more like a lemon.\n\nA new study suggests that this shape is due to the moon's spinning when it was younger, along with the tidal pull of the Earth, creating a specific gravitational effect that stretched out its core.\n\nIn their study, researchers used a laser altimeter to map out the surface of the moon with extraordinary detail. This allowed them to figure out the moon's topography, which then led them to the discovery that the Moon is lemon-shaped. Getting accurate measurements was problematic in previous studies because of the moon's rocky exterior.\n\nOnce researchers discovered the moon's shape, they were then tasked with discovering why it wasn't spherical like Earth and the other planets. This stumped the team, because from what we know, a celestial body's shape comes from its rotation. The moon's lemon shape suggests that it's rotating quickly, but that isn't the case.\n\n\"For the Earth and Mars and other bodies, we know that the dominant shape of the planet is due to its spin,\" said Garrick-Bethell, the lead researcher of the study. But the moon spins very slowly and is far from the Earth so it is not possible that current tidal pulls could be causing the moon's current shape.\n\nHowever, when the moon was forming after being flung from Earth after a large impact, it was spinning faster and was closer to Earth. This meant that the Earth's tidal pull on it was stronger than it is now. The moon started out as liquid rock, but after its surface cooled, a hard crust formed on its surface. The liquid, however, remained beneath that. Earth's strong tidal forces tugged at the liquid underneath the surface, creating a bulge. As the moon moved away from Earth and cooled, the bulge froze in place, creating the moon's existing shape.\n\n\"If you take a water balloon and start spinning it, it will bulge out at the equator, and on the Earth, we have something very similar to that,\" said Garrick-Bethell, the lead researcher of the study.",

Now, new research has solved the mystery of the bulge, finding that it formed from tidal effects early in the moon's development.\n\nUsually, this sort of bulge is an effect of rotation -- like \"a water balloon flattening out as you spin it,\" Ian Garrick-Bethell, an author of the new study, told The New York Times. The Earth itself has just such a bulge. But the moon barely spins, certainly not enough to fully account for its shape. And at a distance of 238,000 miles, the gravitational pull of the Earth isn't strong enough to explain it either.\n\nThe new research incorporated both of these effects, and looked at more subtle factors, including the moon's gravity field and the huge craters leftover from meteor impacts, according to a release. But the big culprit is a phenomenon called tidal heating.\n\nWhen the moon first formed more than 4 billion years ago, it started as a ball of molten rock with a thin crust floating on top. Tidal heating would have caused the crust at the poles to be thinner than the crust in regions aligned with the Earth, over time settling into the bulge shape we see now.\n\n\"Tides start to flex and pull on it,\" Garrick-Bethell told the BBC. \"And that's easy to do because the crust is just floating there. It's not attached to the rest of the moon.\"\n\nAlthough the lemon shape of the moon has been known for a long time -- the \"fossil bulge hypothesis\" explaining its shape was first posited in 1898, according to the release -- the moon's history of being slammed with meteors and other objects have complicated efforts to map its topography, making the answer elusive until now.\n\n\"The craters are like gaps in the data,\" Garrick-Bethell said in the release. \"We did a lot of work to estimate the uncertainties in the analysis that result from those gaps.\"\n\nThe research is published in the journal Nature.",

According to researchers from the University of California, a study that uses advanced laser technology to smooth over the stony surface indicates the satellite is distorted.\n\nThe moon has an equatorial bulge similar to the Earth's bulge. However, the moon's shape is flattened on the top and bottom. Planetary scientist Ian Garrick-Bethell summed it up as a \"lemon with equal with an equatorial bulge\". And unlike Earth's oblate spheroid nature than enables the planet to spin, the moon hardly spins at all.\n\nPrevious explanations for the moon's strange shape include the fact the moon is too far from Earth to be affected by tidal forces. Another theory is the lack of plate tectonics which could potentially mess up the Moon's surface. Garrick-Bethell and his team returned to the moon to find an explanation. The 'Big Splash' event occurred about 4.5 billion years ago. This was when an unknown body, which was roughly the size of Mars, collided into Earth and caused debris to coalesced which formed the moon to what it is today.\n\nAfter this incident, the moon's surface was actually was solid. It also means the moon would have been closer to our planet and spinning a lot faster than it is now. Garrick-Bethell combined all these factors together to explain the moon's current shape.\n\nThe moon has been a hot topic for scientists for a long time. It has also been the subject of other mysteries as well.

                    "body": "A variety of factors combine to give the moon its oblong shape\n\nThe moon, by all terrestrial appearances, is a big, perfectly round ball in the sky. Except, it's not - it bulges around its equator and flattens at its poles, making it shaped more like an heirloom tomato than a round ball of cream cheese. Scientists have known this since 1898, but have speculated as to why. Now, thanks to UC Santa Cruz researchers, the verdict is in: Tidal and rotational forces in the moon's infancy are to blame for its goofy shape.\n\n\"In 2010, we found one area that fits the tidal heating effect, but that study left open the rest of the moon and didn't include the tidal-rotational deformation. In this paper we tried to bring all those considerations together,\" said lead author Ian Garrick-Bethell, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nFour billion years ago, the moon began to cool and solidify after the collision that caused it to break off in the first place. Prior to that, in a more malleable state, Earth's gravitational pull combined with the moon's rotation to cause the warping. \"If you imagine spinning a water balloon, it will start to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator,\" Garrick-Bethell explained.\n\nThat doesn't tell the whole story, though, so the UCSC team dug deeper. In the new paper, they coauthors incorporated other tidal effects into their analysis. They also took into account the large impact basins that have shaped the moon's topography, and they considered the moon's gravity field together with its topography.\n\nBecause of those impact craters, it was impossible to analyze the moon using spherical calculations. Compensating for that, they found that early-stage tidal heating and varying thickness in the crust was responsible for most of the moon's major topographical features.\n\n\"In 2010, we found one area that fits the tidal heating effect, but that study left open the rest of the moon and didn't include the tidal-rotational deformation. In this paper we tried to bring all those considerations together,\" Garrick-Bethell said.\n\nThe rest of the features appeared to match up with the earlier \"fossil bulge\" theory, but this study is the first to establish multiple theories in combination.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the moon's gravitational field doesn't align with its shape, with the principal axis separated by about 34 degrees from the gravitational axis. Craters (and the mass that left with them) likely account for some of the shift, while internal changes are responsible for the rest.\n\nThe only mystery? The topographical differences between the near and far sides - tidal forces can't explain those.",

The study could also explain the satellite's origin as well as its orientation in space.\n\nPrevious research has shown that a relatively \"mild\" cosmic collision gave rise to Earth's moon some 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity molded a mass of ejected rock into the moon that we see today. But, the gravitational pull of our planet doesn't fully explain why the lunar surface has an odd shape.\n\nBack in 1898, scientists proposed an idea known as \"fossil bulge\" hypothesis to explain the bulge on the lunar surface.\n\n\"If you imagine spinning a water balloon, it will start to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator,\" said Ian Garrick-Bethell, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, according to a news release. \"On top of that you have tides due to the gravitational pull of the Earth, and that creates sort of a lemon shape with the long axis of the lemon pointing at the Earth.\"\n\nThe researchers involved in the current study said that the bulge hypothesis doesn't entirely explain the deformed shape moon. The team incorporated tide effects as well as accounted for large impact basins. The team even used data about moon's gravity and topography.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the moon probably got its squashed appearance due to a gravitational process called tidal heating. The tidal heating stretched the lunar surface; the bulge could have occurred at a later period when the moon was still spinning but had slowed down a bit. As the moon drifted away from earth, a tidal surge got frozen in place, The New York Times reported.",

They have discovered that the moon's shape is more or an out-of-shape lemon rather than round.\n\nThe moon was initially said to have been formed by the powerful tidal and gravitational forces influenced by the moon itself. However it was later re-shaped by the Earth's gravitational pull. This is what is said to have caused the shape of the moon to turn more lemon-like.\n\nThis is the first time a team was able to achieve an extremely accurate picture of the moon. They achieved this with the help of a device called a \"laser altimeter\". They unraveled, with the help of these images and the topography, that the moon is not a perfect sphere but has somewhat of an oval-shaped.\n\nThe re-shaping occurred when the moon was still in its initial stages of taking shape as per the lead researcher Ian Garrick-Bethell. Another crucial influencing factor was the manipulation of the Earth's gravitational force on the moon's axis. This caused it to shift a little.\n\nThe lead researcher, Ian Garrick-Bethell, explains this with a simple example. When a balloon spins out of control, we see it form a slight bulge at the center. This is the same phenomena that occurred with the moon when it was in its liquid formation stage.\n\nHe also explains that a collision which had happened around 4 billion years ago between the Earth and another planet-like body also influenced the present shape of the moon. As of now thought the moons shape is not influenced by its spinning or the tidal waves or even the gravitational force of the Earth. Also the fact that it spins a lot slower now than its formative years has no influence in shaping it further.",

The principal axis of the moon's overall shape (the long axis of the lemon) was now separated from the gravity principal axis by about 34 degrees.\n\nHowever, the details and timing of these processes were still uncertain but Garrick-Bethell said that the new analysis should help efforts to work out the details of the moon's early history.",

In fact, it's shaped like a lemon.\n\nNew research, published in Nature this week, reveals that the moon is less like a ball and more like squashed sphere, with a distinct lump. Ian Garrick-Bethell, one of the researchers involved in the new finding, claims that in fact it's \"like a lemon with an equatorial bulge.\" If that's hard to picture, imagine taking a water balloon and spinning on its axis: the rotation causes it to flatten out slightly, and that's how the moon looks.\n\nAll the measurements required to reach this finding were gathered using a laser altimeter to create maps of the moon's surface with unprecedented detail. From there, researchers were able to calculate the true topography of the moon, and understand its actual shape. Such attempts in the past have been hindered by the rough nature of the rocky satellite's surface.\n\nSo why is it that the moon isn't a perfect sphere? The researchers, from University of California, Santa Cruz, suggest that it's probably down to tidal heating which took place when the moon was much younger. Essentially, the orbital forces between Earth and moon could have generated friction in the moon's interior, causing it to deform into the shape it currently exhibits. As the moon's orbit grew larger, the forces reduced, but the shape remained. [Nature via NYT via TheVerge]\n\nPicture: NASA",

Researchers have now found that it is actually shaped like a lemon. According to reports in Nature shifts in the moon's crust have led to a lemon shape. Orbital forces have slowly shaped it into this new form that has an equatorial bulge. Of course this all happened long before even our ancestors were alive which means that our understanding of the moon's shape has been wrong for some time. Scientist Ian Garrick-Bethell, from the University of California, Santa Cruz performed the research with his team. He used a laser altimeter to create super-accurate maps of the moon's surface, before calculating its topography. As with any new findings researchers will have to check his facts. His paper makes a convincing case for this shape. He believes that there was once much more lunar water than what we have seen so far. Shifts in the crust due to tides which shifted then froze apparently contributed to this form if his theory is correct. While this discovery is unlikely to bring any sudden scientific advances it is vital for helping us understand how our Moon interacts with the Earth. Scientists have also discovered water on Jupiter's moon as well and this finding about our nearby body could improve studies later on.",

If going by its terrestrial appearances, the moon is no where closer to being a perfectly round figure, rather has flat bumps on the sides.\n\nThe study about the shape of the moon was conducted by Ian Gerreck Bethell who is the lead author of the study. Ian was quoted saying \"Early tides heated the Moon's crust in different places, and those differences in heating in different areas gave the Moon most of its shape\".\n\nAn astrophysicist at the University of California, Ian Bethell has been was further quoted saying \"Later on, those tides warped the outside of the moon while it was cooling, and it froze in that warped shape,\". His report excerpts have been printed in the Agence France-Presse.\n\nIn further study of the moon's shape, the researchers have revealed that approximately some 4 billion years ago, when the moon was still in its infancy as a hot solar body, the impacts of the gravitational pull of the Earth and other object's activities had given the moon its current shape.\n\nIn a contribution to the study a team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had created a model similar of the topography of the moon. The researchers tried to create an exact model of the moon as it was a few billion years ago. This model was further used for studying the impacts and how the bulges were created.\n\nResearcher Ian Garrick Bethell further elaborated the research by stating an example of the a water balloon as to how it starts to flatten up on the pole area and get bulged on the middle when it is on a rotation spin just like the moon.",

As the balloon spins, it will flatten at the poles and widen at the equator. The same holds true for the Moon.\n\nHowever, scientists noted that this did not add up, since the Moon barely spins and has no plate tectonics. The answer lies in a process known as tidal heating. Following the formation of the Moon, it was left with a thin crust and a molten interior. This remained the case for approximately 200 million years, but the gravitational forces inherent in the tidal heating process stretched the weak crust while it cooled atop the molten core.\n\nThis resulted in the Moon's compressed appearance. The equatorial bulge, however, came afterward, when the slowly rotating Moon shifted away from Earth. This move froze the tidal surges in place and ended the spinning of the celestial body.\n\nThe Moon possesses an off-center distribution of its mass, and this was likely created by massive volcanic eruptions that started approximately four billion years ago and lasted for nearly two billion years. The researchers noted that these episodes of volcanism altered the appearance of the Moon, just as the tidal processes had done before them.\n\nIn order to gather evidence for their theory, Garrick-Bethell and his team studied topographical maps of the Moon that were created through the use of a laser altimeter. They then ran a number of computer simulations in order to recreate the processes of the celestial body's evolution. According to Garrick-Bethell, the team found \"the exact ratios\" that they were expecting for each process involved in the Moon's transformation.",

Los cr\u00e1teres eliminaron algo de masa y tambi\u00e9n hubo alteraciones internas, probablemente relacionadas con cuando la Luna se vuelve volc\u00e1nicamente activa\", agrega.\n\nLos detalles y las fechas de estos procesos son todav\u00eda inciertos pero Garrick-Bethell cree que el nuevo an\u00e1lisis debe ayudar a trabajar en los detalles de la historia temprana de la Luna. Si bien el nuevo estudio muestra que los efectos de la marea pueden dar cuenta de la forma general de la Luna, los procesos de la marea no explican las diferencias topogr\u00e1ficas entre el lado m\u00e1s cercano y el m\u00e1s lejano.",
