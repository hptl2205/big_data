In what was presumed to be a candid moment, Ortiz snapped a picture of himself and Obama holding a personalized Red Sox jersey.\n What an honor!  Thanks for the #selfie, @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/y5Ww74sEID -- David Ortiz (@davidortiz)\nApril 1, 2014\nHowever, Samsung claimed that it helped set up the moment in an attempt to promote its Galaxy Note 3 phone, much like it did with Ellen DeGeneres selfie at the Oscars.  Ortiz signed an ad deal with Samsung just before the trip to become the \"MLB social media insider\" for Samsung, and this was that deal's first big get.  \"When we heard about the visit to the White House, we worked with David and the team on how to share images with fans,\" Samsung said to The Boston Globe.\n For his part, Ortiz denied that it was a promotion to reporters.  \"It wasn't anything promotional or anything like that,\" he said.  \"I mean, who knows that you're going to get a picture with the president, a selfie?  You can't guarantee that.\" \" And as the Journal notes, the White House objection has yet to translate into legal action.\n Ortiz's tweet, which was retweeted and promoted by Samsung, remains online.",

He was trying to promote Samsung.\n The White House honored the 2013 World Series champion baseball team on Tuesday.  Ortiz presented the Commander in Chief with a Red Sox jersey, featuring Obama's name and the number 44 on the back, then asked if he could take a photo with his cell phone.\n \"Oh, he wants to do a selfie,\" Obama said, according to CNN.  \"It's the Big Papi selfie.\" \"\nThen Ortiz tweeted the photo, and Samsung retweeted it to its 5.2 million followers.

Thanks for the #selfie, @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/3I7ckLjquf -- Samsung Mobile US (@SamsungMobileUS)\nApril 1, 2014\nOn Thursday, White House press secretary Jay Carney slammed Samsung for using the president's image to promote their product.  He added that Obama didn't know Ortiz had a promotional deal with Samsung.\n \"I can say that as a rule, the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes,\" he told reporters.  \"We certainly object in this case.\" \"\nThe Associated Press reports Carney didn't elaborate on whether Samsung had been asked to stop using the photo or if Ortiz had been asked to remove it from social media.\n The MLB star told the Boston Globe this week that the selfie was his idea.\n \"I wasn't trying to do anything,\" Ortiz said.  \"It just happened in that moment.  It was a fun thing.  I signed that deal with Samsung a few months ago.  They didn't know what would happen.  Nobody did.\" \"\nIt's the latest in a number of attempts by brands to get creative with advertising via social media.  Calvin Klein has enlisted celebrities like Fergie and Justin Bieber to post photos of themselves in their underwear on Instagram, and Ellen DeGeneres' record-breaking Oscars selfie was also used to promote Samsung.\n During last year's Super Bowl, Oreo didn't spend any money on expensive commercials but generated buzz when it posted a photo on Twitter during the blackout at the New Orleans Superdome.  \"You can still dunk in the dark,\" a photo said of the creme-filled cookie.",

I gave him the jersey, and the photographers were going to take their pictures and I thought, really at the last second, maybe I should snap a shot with my phone while I have the chance ...  It had nothing to do with no deals.\" \"\nSamsung hired Ortiz to be its \"social media insider\" on April 1.  Alex Radetsky, president and founder of Radegen Sports Management, the marketing firm that has represented Ortiz for 12 years, told Mashable that the deal doesn't require Ortiz to snap selfies with the President or anyone else.  \"It certainly was not part of the deal.  it was spontaneous on his part,\" said Radetsky.\n \"I hate to be clich\u00e9d, but it was just David being David.\" \"\nRadetsky said Samsung had been in talks with Ortiz since the end of last season.  The deal was consummated during spring training.  As late as March 27, Ortiz was using an iPhone to post messages and photos on Twitter, according to Echofon:\nOn April 1, he started using an Android phone to tweet.  A story in Sports Business Journal on March 31 predicted that \"when the Red Sox visit the White House this week to commemorate their World Series victory, 'Big Papi' will be tweeting and sending photos on Samsung's behalf.\" \"\nThat prediction proved accurate.  That day, Ortiz took a selfie with President Obama that has been retweeted more than 42,000 times:\nWhat an honor!  Thanks for the #selfie, @BarackObama pic.twitter.com/y5Ww74sEID\n-- David Ortiz (@davidortiz) April 1, 2014\nSince April 1, Ortiz has posted 11 photos on his Twitter feed at the time of this writing.  Samsung Mobile US later retweeted the photo as well.  A Samsung rep told The Boston Globe that \"We were thrilled to see the special, historic moment David Ortiz captured with his Galaxy Note 3 during his White House visit.  It was an honor to help him capture such an incredible and genuine moment of joy and excitement.  Similar to the selfie Ellen was able to capture during the Oscars, this was an opportunity for David to share the incredible moment with his fans.\" \"\nThe move came after Samsung's sponsorship of the Academy Awards broadcast in March.  That deal culminated with Ellen DeGeneres' star-studded selfie, which was retweeted more than 3 million times.  The Wall Street Journal reported later that the stunt was part of a sponsorship and ad pact between ABC and Samsung.  Samsung's media-buying firm Starcom MediaVest negotiated to have the Galaxy smartphone integrated into the show, according to the report.  DeGeneres' selfie was taken with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3.\n Samsung reps could not be reached for further comment.\n Two days after the photo circulated, White House Spokesman Jay Carney said the White House \"objected\" to the photo.  \"I can tell you that as a rule the White House objects to attempts to use the President's likeness for commercial purposes.  And we certainly object in this case,\" Carney said.\n It was unclear whether the White House planned to take any action.\n Ben Sturner, president and CEO of Leverage Agency, a sports marketing firm, said it's the norm these days for social media activity to be baked into athlete sponsorship deals.  \"It's smart of Samsung to say 'Use your phone wherever you can' as part of the deal,\" said Sturner.\n Sturner doubts the selfie was pre-planned.  \"I think it was a spur of the moment thing,\" said Sturner.  If every move is pre-determined \"you lose some authenticity,\" he said.",

As the Wall Street Journal notes, Samsung admittedly coordinated with Ortiz before the meeting, advising him on how to share images with his fans.  Whether or not this incident will have any consequences for either Ortiz or Samsung remains to be seen.\n But one thing is for sure: after this and the Oscar selfie by Ellen Degeneres, celebrities apparently snapping a harmless \"selfies\" will be viewed in a different light.

Win McNamee, Getty Images\nAnother celebrity selfie tied to Samsung is making a splash on social media, but this time the company is suffering a backlash it never expected.\n Samsung got lots of attention after the the star-studded selfie from Oscars host Ellen Degeneres became the most retweeeted tweet ever.  The company was excited to continue the momentum when it heard slugger David Ortiz was headed to the White House to meet President Obama.\n Samsung prepped Ortiz and the team on how to snap photos and share them, and sure enough Ortiz asked Obama if he could take a photo of the two on his phone.  \"He wants to do a selfie.  It's the Big Papi selfie,\" Obama joked, according to ESPN.  So selfie was shot and tweeted by Ortiz.\n But when Samsung retweeted the image, a controversy started to grow.  Did Samsung cross the line?  Did Ortiz line up that photo because of his endorsement deal with the company?\n The criticism poured in.  \"Duping the President of the United States into participating with your social media campaign has to be a new low for advertising,\" wrote Businessweek's Joshua Green.  \"It's flat-out shady.  And Ortiz should be embarrassed.\" \"\nOrtiz and Degeneres have killed the spontaneity of the selfie, writes Marc Weinreich in Sports Illustrated.  \"At the very least it should make us cognizant of the fact that many of these supposedly candid moments are in fact carefully calculated, paid advertisements sponsored by cell phone carriers.\" \"\nThe Obama administration wasn't pleased either.  \"As a rule the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes,\" spokesman Jay Carney told The Wall Street Journal.  \"And we certainly object in this case.\" \"\nTwitter users were outraged.  \"After the @Samsung selfie deception with Obama and the Oscar selfie, I will never buy a Samsung product,\" wrote one user.  \"Reminder: Nothing is real, everything is a lie, life is only a succession of hoaxes and promotional stunts,\" wrote Mark Berman of The Washington Post.\n Was anyone out there defending Samsung and Ortiz?  Well, yes: Samsung and Ortiz.  Samsung said it \"didn't know if or what he would be able to capture using his Note 3 device.\" \"\nOrtiz described the photo as a once-in-a-lifetime moment.  \"It wasn't anything promotional or anything like that,\" Ortiz told USA Today.  \"I mean, who knows that you're going to get a picture with the president, a selfie?  You can't guarantee that.\" \"",

The post got more than 40,000 retweets and 47,000 favorites, and was even featured on ESPN.\n What an honor!  Thanks for the #selfie, @BarackObama http://t.co/y5Ww74sEID --\nDavid Ortiz (@davidortiz) April 01, 2014\nIf anyone was more excited about the moment than Red Sox Nation, it was Samsung.  The company immediately picked up the selfie -- which, it pointed out, had been taken with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 -- and promoted it to its five-plus million followers.  \"We were thrilled to see the special, historic moment David Ortiz captured with his Galaxy Note 3 during his White House visit,\" Samsung told the Boston Globe.  \"It was an honor to help him capture such an incredible and genuine moment of joy and excitement.\" \"\nNot so genuine or spontaneous, actually.  It turns out that Ortiz had inked a new endorsement deal with the cellphone provider just one day earlier.  Now the White House is pushing back against the commercial use of the president's image by Samsung.\n \"As a rule the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes, and we certainly object in this case,\" Carney said in his Thursday news briefing.\n The incident is yet another example of the hidden social-media promotions that drive the Federal Trade Commission crazy.  The regulator is fighting an ongoing battle against advertisers that produce what it considers \"inauthentic content\" -- namely, ads that don't obviously look like ads.  Most recently, the FTC chastised Cole Haan for a Pinterest shoe contest that it felt was a deceptive form of marketing.\n For his part, Ortiz has denied orchestrating the stunt for Samsung's benefit.  He told the Boston Globe on Wednesday that the selfie was his own idea.  \"That was one of those things that just happened,\" he said.  \"I gave him the jersey, and the photographers were going to take their pictures and I thought, really at the last second, maybe I should snap a shot with my phone while I have the chance.  It had nothing to do with no deals.\" \"\nRelated",

Reportedly, the company provided Ortiz, who has an endorsement deal with Samsung, information on \"how to share images with fans\" prior to his visit.\n After taking the photo, Ortiz shared it to Twitter, where it was retweeted by the @SamsungMobileUS account and then used as a \"promoted\" tweet, meaning it will show against certain users' feeds as an ad.  The company did not ask permission from anyone at the White House to use the photo as advertising on its own Twitter feed.\n The White House made clear that it doesn't want the president's likeness to be used in ads.  \"As a rule, the White House objects to attempts to use the president's likeness for commercial purposes,\" White House press secretary Jay Carney told the Wall Street Journal.  The President famously enjoys a good selfie, though they are not typically co-opted for branding opportunities.\n It's not the first time Samsung co-opted the selfie for an ad.  During the Oscars, the company received some ridicule for having host Ellen Degeneres stage a photo op with a handful of other A-list celebrities.  The tweet with the photo was to be propelled to glory as the most-retweeted tweet of all time.\n But Samsung has proven over time to be a big fan of the brand-ambassador model.

Its arrival was presaged in an apparently spontaneous moment when Oscar host Ellen DeGeneres handed her big white Samsung Android to Bradley Cooper and got him to take a selfie of a group of pals whose combined net worth tops that of the gross domestic product of Djibouti.  Of course, little is spontaneous in the age of ubiquitous marketing.  Samsung was a sponsor of the Oscar broadcast and had product placement in its contract.\n And little was spontaneous at the White House this Tuesday when the World Champion Boston Red Sox paid a visit and slugger David Ortiz produced his Samsung to snap a shot of himself and President Obama.  In the background, one of his teammates sing-songed, \"Cha-ching!\" Ortiz, a paid Samsung endorser, had done Ellen one better by capturing himself with the Ruler of the Free World.\n The era of the selfie-razzi has arrived, and it is not likely to go away any time soon.  The Oscar selfie was tweeted over 30 million times.  The selfie Ortiz took with Obama was tweeted out within moments of its capture by Samsung.  As I write this, no doubt there are an army of agents at MCA on the phone negotiating selfie rights for their clients.\n Their clients, it appears, are only too happy to serve as their own paparazzi.  Heck, the punked prez himself unofficially endorsed the practice after his own selfie with comely Danish P.M. Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial service.  Celebs may gripe about paparazzi, but many cannot live without them.  Some, like Alec Baldwin and Sean Penn, even lump up the occasional photog to win the front page of the Enquirer or the New York Post.  Now, A-listers can snap away at their private lives with their soign\u00e9 buddies and get paid for their troubles.  Samsung has given them a way to cut paparazzi out of the picture.\n Clearly, then, this is a medium with nothing but upside.  It's easy, it's effective, and it's lucrative -- the celebrity triple play.  But there's a problem.  Unless the celeb taking the shot is doing so on a live TV program or in front of the White House or such, he or she needs a \"second shooter\" to photograph him or her taking the selfie, so as to get the Samsung logo on his or her phone in the frame.  That's the money shot.\n Therefore, I envision a selfie-razzi subclass forming among long-faded B-players.  We'll see tweets of Brad hoisting his Samsung over himself and Angelina in the hot tub, captured by Erik Estrada; Jay-Z and Beyonce in their private helicopter shot by Vanilla Ice; Harry Reid and Marco Rubio at the rifle range snapped by Jimmy Carter.\n The problem with this new marketing medium is that it's limited to a few manufacturers of cell phones.  But, if it takes off like I think it will, it's only a matter of time before we'll see phones shaped like Ford Fusions, Snickers bars, and Obamacare policies.",

United Biscuits is pumping \u00a310m into Jacob's as part of its biggest marketing campaign ever for the brand as it aims to grow the business by a fifth by 2016.  And Jack the Baker is the star of the show.\n Inspired by a real-life employee, he will star in a number of TV spots that will hero one Jacob's product.  The ads also introduce Jacob's new strapline \"Snack Happy\".\n The campaign aims to convince shoppers its savoury biscuits are a healthier snacking alternative and boost growth in the category to levels seen in markets such as the US and Australia.  United Biscuits will be hoping to recreate the success of its campaign for sister brand McVitie's, which has led to growth in the \"high single digits\" for its sweet biscuit products since it launched two months ago.\n The Government is to take action to make the intangible, err, tangible.  It is to launch a campaign to raise awareness of the value of brands among bankers after a report found the worth of such intangible assets was not being considered enough when financiers were determining the value of a company.\n The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) found the value of \"intangible assets\" - the value of a company's brand based on factors such as perception, trust, awareness and sentiment - grew 10 per cent to \u00a3137.5bn between 2009 and 2011.  Conversely, the value of tangible assets such as building and machinery fell to \u00a389.8bn.\n Nike has been fire-fighting this week after fans, The Sun, MPs and even the Prime Minister lined up to slam the price of its replica England shirts.  Nike is selling premium versions with all the bells and whistles of the shirts worn by players on the pitch for \u00a390 and the rest for \u00a360.\n Critics jumped on the maximum price as an example of how rampant capitalism has ripped the heart out of sport (or something) and cash out of pockets.\n The furore has damaged Nike's brand, with customers less likely to buy its products following news of the price hike, according to YouGov's BrandIndex.\n Ikea has embarked on an interior transformation tour across the US with the launch of a new home improvement show.  Tips on how to furnish homes using the retailer's products are dished out by the \"Ikea Home Tour Squad\" in the ongoing YouTube series.  The group will revamp two apartments in four cities - Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York - while also interacting with fans on Twitter and Instagram.  The team of five will also be dishing out advice to urbanites at local events in each city.  Those hoping to take part in the realty-TV show need to submit a video online explaining how Ikea can help improve their home.\n Heineken creates posters with stories\nHeineken has partnered with a non-profit organisation for the first time for its \"Legends\" campaign.  The brewer's Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam-created drive charts how a host of artists and entertainers created a series of one-off posters in support of Reporters Without Borders.  The posters can be viewed on a Tumblr page and will be auctioned off later this month (13 April).  A video (see above) documents how some of the images were created.\n ONE TO WATCH\nKeen to ride the wave of appearing in the \"Oscar selfie\" that went viral last month, Samsung used President Obama in its latest stunt.  It retweeted a selfie taken by brand ambassador, baseball player David Ortiz, with the president to its 5.2 million followers.  But Samsung's hijack of what was a formal visit has not gone down well inside the White House.  It released an official statement slamming the stunt, which has since been retweeted more than 40,000 times.  It objected to the phone maker's attempt to use the president's face for commercial purposes.  Ortiz has reportedly denied that Samsung paid him any money for taking the photo.\n TWEETS OF THE WEEK\n@andynairn - founding partner of Lucky Generals ad agency\non form with his punning\n\"Kettle chips are always a bit disappointing.
