It was 16 feet (5 metres) tall and 36 feet (11 metres) long, weighing seven tons, with a duckbill on its head and a hump-like sail on its back. Throw in those killer claws, tufts of feathers here and there, and no teeth -- and try not to snicker.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, it ate like a giant vacuum cleaner.\n\nThat's Deinocheirus mirificus, which means \"terrible hands that look peculiar.\" It is newly reimagined after a full skeleton was found in Mongolia and described in a paper released Wednesday by the journal Nature. Some 70 million years old, it's an ancestral relative of the modern ostrich and belongs to the dinosaur family often called ostrich dinosaurs.\n\n\"Deinocheirus turned out to be one the weirdest dinosaurs beyond our imagination,\" study lead author Yuong-Nam Lee, director of the Geological Museum in Daejeon, South Korea, said in an email.\n\nWhen scientists in 1965 found the first forearm bones -- nearly 8 feet long -- many of them envisioned \"a creature that would strike terror in people,\" said University of Maryland dinosaur expert Thomas Holtz Jr, who wasn't part of the study. \"Now it's a creature that would strike bemusement, amazement.\"\n\nAnd yes, he said, \"it's pretty goofy.\"\n\nThe find is tremendous but is a cautionary tale about jumping to conclusions without enough evidence, said University of Chicago dinosaur expert Paul Sereno, who wasn't part of the discovery.\n\nIt also reminds us that evolution isn't always what we think, Sereno said.\n\n\"This is evolution in a dinosaur -- not a mammal -- world,\" Sereno said in email. \"The starting point is a two-legged animal looking somewhat like a fuzzy-feathered ostrich. Now you want to get really big and suck up lots of soft vegetation. In the end you look like a goofy Michelin ostrich with fuzz and a tail -- not a cow.\"\n\nLee figures the tilted wide hips and massive feet show that Deinocheirus was a slow mover and probably grew so big to escape from being regularly feasted on by bigger dinosaurs.\n\nIt had a beak that could eat plants, but it also had a massive tongue that created suction for vacuuming up food from the bottoms of streams, lakes and ponds, Lee wrote.\n\nOriginally Lee's team couldn't find the dinosaur's skull, but a tip from another researcher led them to recover it from the private market in Germany.\n\nSome kids will soon adopt this dinosaur as their favourite, Holtz said, \"and those are kids with a sense of humour.\"\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nNature: http://www.nature.com/nature\n\n___\n\nSeth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears",

Efe\n\nDos nuevos f\u00f3siles de esqueletos parciales del misterioso dinosaurio Deinocheirus Mirificus han revelado que este ter\u00f3podo gigante \"casi tan grande como un Tyrannosaurus Rex\" era un ornitomimosaurio, similar a las avestruces modernas, seg\u00fan un estudio publicado hoy en la revista \"Nature\".\n\nLos expertos han podido recopilar casi la totalidad de los huesos de este dinosaurio, que vivi\u00f3 durante el Cret\u00e1cico en lo que hoy es el sur de Mongolia.\n\nEste hallazgo \"permite entender mejor la ecolog\u00eda de Mongolia hace 70 millones de a\u00f1os\", afirm\u00f3 a Efe el ge\u00f3logo coreano Yuong-Nam Lee, del Instituto de Corea de Geociencia y Recursos Minerales (KIGAM).\n\nLos primeros f\u00f3siles de este dinosaurio \"fueron descubiertos en los a\u00f1os 60 por las expediciones polaco-mongolas\", seg\u00fan el paleont\u00f3logo estadounidense Thomas Holtz, de la Universidad de Maryland.\n\nHoltz describe al Deinocheirus como un ter\u00f3podo con cierto parecido a un \"dinosaurio con pico de pato\", de cabeza peque\u00f1a y con unas caderas y piernas hechas m\u00e1s para \"soportar su enorme peso que para correr\".\n\nSe trataba de un dinosaurio b\u00edpedo con unas extremidades anteriores que med\u00edan 2,4 metros de largo, incluidas unas garras de m\u00e1s de 20 cent\u00edmetros.\n\nEl enorme tama\u00f1o de este reptil gener\u00f3 m\u00faltiples especulaciones durante d\u00e9cadas tras el hallazgo de los primeros f\u00f3siles, ya que se pod\u00eda tratar del \"mayor ter\u00f3podo jam\u00e1s encontrado\".\n\nEn 2009, un equipo coreano-mongol volvi\u00f3 a la cantera mongola y consigui\u00f3 reconstruir casi la totalidad del esqueleto.\n\nEstos hallazgos revelaron que se pod\u00eda tratar de un dinosaurio con una dieta vegetariana o mixta, m\u00e1s que de un depredador.\n\nSin embargo, faltaba por encontrar el cr\u00e1neo para responder a muchas de esas dudas.\n\nAfortunadamente, indica Holtz, el cr\u00e1neo y los pies de uno de estos ter\u00f3podos se encontraban en una colecci\u00f3n privada y el paleont\u00f3logo belga Pascal Godefroit convenci\u00f3 en 2009 a los propietarios para ponerlos a disposici\u00f3n de los investigadores.\n\nEn los nuevos f\u00f3siles estudiados ahora por el equipo estadounidense y coreano se han hallado escamas y huesos de peces de peque\u00f1as dimensiones, \"lo que confirma que ten\u00edan una dieta amplia en peces, peque\u00f1os animales y plantas\", detalla Holtz, y que pertenec\u00edan a la familia de los ornitomimosaurios.\n\nAntes de este hallazgo, los cient\u00edficos no pod\u00edan confirmar si era un omn\u00edvoro o un depredador, pero ahora el paleont\u00f3logo asegura que, \"si se tratara de un depredador, habr\u00eda sido uno de los m\u00e1s grandes de todos\".\n\nEste descubrimiento ayuda a responder a casi todas las dudas sobre este ter\u00f3podo gigante, aunque, tal y como concluye Holtz, \"a\u00fan quedan por resolver algunas cuestiones, como saber la manera en la que interactuaba con otros dinosaurios de su entorno\".",
