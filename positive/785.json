All-Star forward Blake Griffin has improved his all-around game, and Paul is perhaps the league's best point guard.\n \"This team runs at a high level, they pass the ball up the floor at a high level,\" Durant said.  \"They advance the ball, they have athletic guys and shooters all around.  Our defense is going to be tested.\" \"\nDurant is the league's scoring champion, and point guard Russell Westbrook is one of the NBA's best athletes.

Durant struggled through much of the series against Memphis before returning to form in the final two games.  In the first five games, he averaged 28 points and shot 40 percent from the field.  In the last two games, he averaged 34.5 points and shot 56 percent.\n Memphis guard Tony Allen, who had success defending Durant, said the rest of the league could be in trouble.\n \"Should be easy for him, a lot easier for him now that I ain't got to harass him,\" Allen said.\n \u25a0 Paul's hamstring: Paul has been dealing with a sore right hamstring, a bad problem to have against Oklahoma City's speed.  Memphis' Mike Conley entered Game 7 with a strained hamstring, and Westbrook finished with a triple-double.\n Paul had 22 points and 14 assists in 42 minutes against Golden State on Saturday.\n \u25a0 Griffin vs. Ibaka: Griffin ranked sixth in the league with 24.1 points per game in the regular season.  He is usually the dominant athlete in his matchups, but Ibaka, who led the NBA in total blocks in the regular season and was fourth in the Defensive Player of the Year balloting, might be his match.\n Thunder coach Scott Brooks said defending Griffin is different than it once was.\n \"His mid-range jump shot -- you can't give him that anymore,\" Brooks said.  \"He can make that, and he knocks that down, and he shoots it with confidence, and they look for him.\" \"\nWILL WESTBROOK PASS?  For much of the first five games against Memphis, Westbrook shot 34 percent from the field and averaged 25.4 points on 25.6 shot attempts as his team fell behind 3-2.  In the final two games, he shot 51 percent from the field, averaged 26 points on 18.5 shots per game and added 10.5 assists as the Thunder rolled to two blowout wins.\n \"He's an attack player,\" Brooks said.  \"He wants to get to the lane and finish around the paint.  There's always a balance, and I think he's done a good job the last two or three games of finding that.\" \"\n\u25a0 Do the Clippers have anything left?  The Clippers have acknowledged that the Sterling situation has taken its toll.  They played a tough seven-game series against the Warriors and follow it with Game 1 on the road two days later against a team that had the league's second-best home record at 34-7.\n The Clippers defeated the Thunder in Oklahoma City 125-117 on Feb. 23, though under much different circumstances.\n \"It's tough to win in OKC,\" Clippers forward Matt Barnes said.  \"These playoffs aren't going to be easy, but we've won there this season, and we're looking to go up there and get one.\" \"",

                    "body": "The Los Angeles Clippers' second season started with a loss to the Warriors, increased in attention with an incredible audio tape featuring team team owner Donald Sterling and wound down with a hallway shouting match following a thrilling Game 7 victory over the Golden State Warriors.\n On Monday, the Warriors are ancient history.\n Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder are fresh off their own seven-game series against the Memphis Grizzlies.  Had Zach Randolph not lost his mind for a moment and thrown a punch, perhaps the Thunder would not have survived the opening round.  However, the Thunder made it through.\n Both the Clippers and the Thunder still have a great deal to prove before reaching the conference finals, as neither was dominant in the first round of the playoffs.  However, both teams overcame unforeseen adversity and seemed to bond over off-court distractions.\n After the Sterling mess and the commissioner's subsequent ban, the shouting match outside the locker rooms following Game 7 on Saturday was a minor footnote in the Clippers' postseason.  Physically, the Clippers may be hurting, but emotionally, the owner's ill-advised comments appear to have strengthened the team's bond inside the locker room.\n For the Oklahoma City Thunder, newspaper headlines stirred the pot and lit a flame under the team.  A \"Mr. Unreliable\" headline aimed at Kevin Durant in a local Oklahoma City newspaper resulted in widespread criticism from the national media.\n On the court, Durant and his teammates appeared to gain greater focus following the bad press.  Durant averaged 34.5 points and 9.0 rebounds over the final two games of the first round series -- both wins for the Thunder.\n Marc Stein of ESPN.com reported that the reliable Durant was expected to be presented the NBA's Most Valuable Player award on Tuesday, which is the off-day in between Game 1 and Game 2 in the series.\n The team may be most identifiable by Durant's no. 35 jersey, but former UCLA Bruin Russell Westbrook, arguably the most explosive player in the NBA, plays an important role for the Thunder.  Westbrook averaged 25.6 points, 9.7 rebounds and 8.0 assists per game in the opening round, but his 4.9 turnovers per game were far too high for a point guard -- or any other position, really.\n For those counting lines to figure out who the Thunder's leading actor is, Westbrook attempted 165 shots in the first round and Durant threw up 166 field goal attempts in the opening round.  Adding in free throw attempts, Durant attempted 60 free throws against the Grizzlies, which were 10 more than the Thunder's aggressive point guard.\n Durant may be the leading actor, but Westbrook's role is equally important to the success of the Thunder at this point in the season.  In Game 7 against the Grizzlies, Westbrook put up 27 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds.\n For the Clippers, Chris Paul's hamstring limited the veteran point guard offensively against the Warriors.  Paul averaged 17.4 points and 9.0 assists per game in the opening round, and those numbers were roughly a couple points and a couple assists shy of his regular season marks.  More troubling than the slight dip in his statistics, Paul's movement and mannerisms on the court have been concerning.\n Guarding Westbrook would be a serious challenge for any fully healthy point guard, and Paul's ability to slow down Westbrook and match the former Bruin's production are points of interest in this series.\n Another point of interest is Blake Griffin.  With Durant accepting due praise as the top performer in the NBA this season, Griffin has the ability to steal the spotlight from the NBA's MVP.  Griffin's level of production on this stage can elevate the Clippers' former no. 1 overall pick into a new category of elite player.  For the Clippers to be successful, Griffin, who is an Oklahoma City native, needs to consistently perform at a high level.\n Monday's Game 1 will not win the series, but it should set the tone.\n The Thunder will be the home team for the first two games, but the Clippers did manage a win in the hostile environment of Oklahoma City during the regular season.  The Clippers and Thunder split the regular season series 2-2, and both teams managed a road win.\n For the Clippers, a road win is required to win the series, and a win in Game 1 would be a great way to start a series that promises to be a classic.",

                    "body": "(SportsNetwork.c com) - Two teams in the headlines will do battle in the Western Conference semifinals when the Oklahoma City Thunder, the No. 2 seed, meet the Los Angeles Clippers, who are ranked third.\n For the Thunder, \"Mr. Unreliable\" became something of a rallying cry.  The Oklahoman ran that headline describing Kevin Durant, who will probably be handed the league's MVP award before a home game during this series.\n Durant responded with 36 and 33 points in the final two games against the Memphis Grizzlies, both double-digit victories for OKC and both were elimination games.\n \"He's one of the best players on the planet,\" Oklahoma City head coach Scott Brooks said of his superstar.  \"He's going to continue to help us win games and move us forward, not only with his shot-making, but his playmaking.\" \"\nSadly, the Clippers' headlines were of a much more serious tone.\n Their owner, Donald Sterling, was caught on tape making racist comments.  It affected the team in its Game 4 loss, then, before Game 5, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life and prompted the Board of Governors to force Sterling to sell the team.\n Through this tumultuous time, the Clippers hung on for a Game 7 win over the Golden State Warriors in the first round.\n \"I just wanted us to win the game,\" said Clippers head coach Doc Rivers.  \"Not because of all of this stuff, but this team just needed this win.  I thought our guys fought.  The adversity, they went through it.  It drained them and they found enough energy to find a way to win the game.\" \"\nBoth teams needed seven games to dispatch their foes, but that was not a negative.  The balance and depth of the Western Conference is outstanding and these two teams exemplify that.\n The Clippers finished as the highest-scoring team during the regular season, while the Thunder came in fifth.  Oklahoma City ranked 12th in opponents' scoring, while LA was two spots worse.\n During the season, the two squads were evenly-matched.  The Thunder have won five of the last seven meetings, but the two sides split four meetings this season.  Each team won a road game during the four matchups in the 2013-14 campaign.\n \"These playoffs aren't going to be easy, but we've won there this season, and we're looking to go up there and get one,\" said Clippers forward Matt Barnes.\n The Clippers went 1-2 on the road against the Warriors, but were 3-1 at the Staples Center.  The Thunder struggled a bit at Chesapeake Energy Arena, going 2-2 versus Memphis.  Conversely, OKC was 2-1 in Memphis.\n Both teams have very little turnaround time.  Both won their series-clinchers on Saturday night and Monday evening, they'll be back at it.\n \"We already passed the books out, so they have all the Oklahoma books in their locker, I asked them to go home and read tonight.  That's their homework,\" Rivers said after the Game 7 win.\n Oklahoma City had a tougher trek getting to this point against the physical Grizzlies.  The Thunder had to win two elimination games, including one on the road.  While no one would confuse what the Clippers went through with anything associated with on-court issues, the Thunder did have to battle to advance to the semifinals.\n \"I know that they're going to keep fighting,\" Brooks said.  \"I know that we have a resilient group that loves to compete.  We don't like to lose.  We always try to figure out ways to get better.  We're not mistake-free, but our effort is right on.  I love coaching this team because of that.\" \"\nMATCHUPS:\nBACKCOURT: Russell Westbrook is a superstar.  Is he a true point guard?  Probably not in the conventional sense since he's score-first, not pass-first.  He did average 25.6 points in the Grizzlies series, but he took 23 shot attempts a game, which was the same number as Durant.  Westbrook shot 38 percent from the field and committed 4.9 turnovers per game.  He is dynamic and carry the team.  He rose to the occasion Game 7 with a triple-double.  Brooks took Thabo Sefolosha out of the starting lineup in favor of Caron Butler.  The move was made to provide an offensive spark and Butler averaged 11 points in his two starts.\n Chris Paul is the best point guard in the sport.  His Game 7 performance of 22 points, 14 assists and just two turnovers was sensational.  Paul is a dual threat who can really wreak havoc on the defensive end.  For the series against Golden State, Paul averaged 17.4 ppg and 9.0 assists per game.  J.J. Redick played moderately well against the Warriors.  He posted 14.3 ppg and shot 39 percent from deep.\n EDGE: CLIPPERS\nFRONTCOURT: Durant will win the league's MVP very soon according to reports (and common sense).  He averaged 29.9 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.6 blocks against the Grizz.  Granted, Durant shot 44 percent and 32 percent from 3-point range, which are low numbers by his standards.  But, after the fateful headline, Durant's shooting percentage vaulted up to 56 percent.  Serge Ibaka is an underrated piece of the puzzle.  He average 13.0 points, 8.9 rebounds and 2.6 blocks against the awesome front line of the Grizzlies.  Ibaka is an elite defensive player.  Kendrick Perkins was needed against Memphis to bang around with Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph.  He will be tasked with trying to keep DeAndre Jordan off the glass.\n Blake Griffin has become a serious star.  Griffin will likely finish third behind Durant and LeBron James in MVP voting because his game evolved and became complete.  He ran into foul trouble against the Warriors, but still averaged 23.3 points.  Jordan was massive versus Golden State.  His per-game numbers were 12.1 points, 15.1 rebounds and 4.0 blocks.  That's staggering production.  Barnes is out there primarily for defense.\n EDGE: THUNDER\nBENCH: Reggie Jackson was a Sixth Man of the Year candidate and averaged 12.1 points against the Grizzlies.  He was absent in quite a few games though.  Derek Fisher provided steady backup point guard play and Steven Adams and Nick Collison are high-motor bigs.  Sefolosha went from starting to not playing a single minute.\n According to reports, Jamal Crawford has won the prestigious sub award.  He's really like a starter in terms of minutes and production.  Crawford averaged 16.7 points against the Warriors in just 24 minutes.  Darren Collison, Glen Davis and Danny Granger also contributed in the previous series.\n EDGE: CLIPPERS\nCOACHING: Scott Brooks is a former Coach of the Year whose lost an NBA Finals.  His team loves him, he loves them.  Brooks' decision regarding Sefolosha is odd, but the Thunder are 2-0 with him earning DNP-CDs.\n Doc Rivers is a championship-winning coach and his stewardship during this ugly episode was nothing short of amazing.  He instantly improved the Clippers' defense and the play of Jordan and Griffin.  Rivers was acquired from the Boston Celtics for a first-round pick and this is where the Clippers need his tutelage.  If LA is to make its first Western Conference Finals ever, Rivers will need to show them how it's done.\n EDGE: CLIPPERS\nPREDICTION: Do the Clippers still have anything left in the tank after dealing with the Sterling incident?\n Do the Thunder still have anything left in the tank after dealing with the Memphis Grizzlies?\n Those are the two biggest questions associated with this series.  The teams are very evenly matched, so it might come down to the little things.\n The Thunder believe they had a chance to make the NBA Finals, or, at the very least, the Western Conference Finals, last season.  Westbrook injured his knee in the first round against Houston and the Thunder were done.  They are healthy now.\n Rivers was brought to LA for situations like this.  The talent has been there since Paul become a Clipper.  Vinny Del Negro couldn't get them past certain road blocks.  Rivers is an easy guy to have faith in because he's done it in the past and always gotten the most out of his Boston teams, especially in the postseason.\n SPORTS NETWORK PREDICTION: CLIPPERS in SIX\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",

                    "body": "The Thunder and Clippers are set to renew their physical rivalry in round two of the Western Conference Playoffs.\n Here we go.  Round two.  While this is certainly the matchup that most anticipated in the second round of the Western Conference, the way that both teams got here was far from most expectations.  The Oklahoma City Thunder were pushed to the brink by an extremely tough Memphis Grizzlies team, forced to win two straight elimination games to move on.  The Los Angeles Clippers, meanwhile, became embroiled in the Donald Sterling racism case, but were still able to focus on basketball and down the Golden State Warriors in seven games.\n So here we find ourselves with two Western Conference powerhouses ready to do battle.  If the season series is any implication, this should be another fantastic series.  The teams split their four meeting, with the Thunder only outscoring the Clippers by four points in total.  Looking forward to Saturday's Game 1, let's take a look at the matchups that we will see.\n Point Guard\nRussell Westbrook (OKC, Player Efficiency Rating in Playoffs: 21.4) vs. Chris Paul (LAC, PER: 20.2)\nWestbrook found a rhythm during the end of the Memphis series, notching two triple-doubles, including an impressive 16 assists in Game 7.  If he can be that kind of facilitator for the entire series against the Clippers, he and Paul should be about even in terms of play.  Paul himself is a nightly threat for 10+ assists.  Both players have been injured for long stretches this season, but have bounced back in great form.  Westbrook is more athletic and a better scorer, but Paul can score effectively, is an elite distributer and is not as inconsistent as Westbrook.  However, Westbrook seems to be in the zone, and with no extra rest he should be able to pick up right where he left off.  Paul had a nice opening series, but it was Westbrook with the more impressive stats and the triple-doubles to show for it.\n After Game 5 against Memphis, Scott Brooks did something that he hadn't done since 2009: change his starting lineup for reasons other than injury.  Replacing the innefective Thabo Sefolosha with the veteran Butler, a former Clipper, proved a great move, as he averaged 10.5 points and proved a huge threat from deep.  Redick has been a deep threat his entire career, making a name for himself based on his ability to shoot the three.  It is unsure if Brooks will make the change back to Sefolosha, who did not play at all in Games 6 or 7, or stick with Butler, but neither of them are a better than Redick.  Put simply, while Butler and Sefolosha both have their skills, Redick would start at the 2 guard over both of them if he was on the Thunder.\n No debate here.  Durant was Mr. Reliable for the Thunder when they needed him most, scoring at will in Games 6 and 7.  While Barnes is a serviceable veteran who has played well for the Clippers, this is the MVP we're talking about.\n Ibaka is a fantastic defender and about as excellent of a third scoring option in the NBA, but Blake Griffin is playing on another level this season.  He was the undeniable MVP for the Clippers this season, leading them during Chris Paul's injury stint.  If there was a second MVP award that LeBron James and Kevin Durant were not eligible for, I would put my money on Griffin winning it.  He is a pure athletic force.  To be fair, Ibaka is a much better defender than David Lee, who was tasked with stopping Griffin in the first round.  The two also have a history together, having gotten in a few skirmishes during games.  While the individual matchup will be fantastic, this Clippers are becoming Griffin's team, and he is stepping up his play to prove it.\n Kendrick Perkins (OKC, PER: 8.4) vs. DeAndre Jordan (LAC, PER: 20.2)\nI have been one of Kendrick Perkins' harshest critics, but he actually played a very effective series against the Grizzlies.  He made 12 of his 17 shots, including the buzzer-beating putback that sent Game 2 into overtime.  He also combined with Serge Ibaka to make things tough for Zach Randolph all series.  That being said, he can still be a liability.  DeAndre Jordan, in the meantime, is not.  Jordan was the Clippers X factor in the first round.  Always a double-double threat, Jordan has the ability to score 20 points and pull down 20 rebounds on any given night.  If he brings the toughness and physicality on the boards that he had in the first round, Perkins is in for a rough series.\n Thunder - Reggie Jackson, Nick Collison, Derek Fisher, Jeremy Lamb, Steven Adams, Thabo Sefolosha, Perry Jones, Andre Roberson, Hasheem Thabeet\nClippers - Jamaal Crawford, Darren Collison, Glen Davis, Danny Granger, Hedo Turkoglu, Willie Green, Jared Dudley, Ryan Hollins, Reggie Bullock\nWow.  What a mismatch.  Of the nine players listed for the Thunder above, only five of them (Jackson, Nick Collison, Fisher, Adams and Sefolosha) saw playing time during meaningful minutes.  Sefolosha lost his starting job and, evidently, any role in the rotation, sitting on the bench for all of Games 6 and 7.  Nick Collison also seems to have lost his playing time to Steven Adams, sitting all of Game 7 himself.  Jackson has been great, and Fisher has been effective, but look at this Clippers bench.  They all know their roles and are extremely effective at them.  Led by Sixth Man of the Year Crawford, the Clippers bench is the deepest in the league.\n Brooks has been great in Oklahoma City, but he does have his flaws.  As previously stated, the Butler start was his first lineup change since he put Russell Westbrook into the starting lineup in 2009.  He has his team and front office's support, but he is no Doc Rivers, who is the staple for coaching success in today's NBA.  He already has a championship on his resume and is one of the best in the league.  I mean, the Clippers traded for him.\n Advantage: Clippers\nOverall: Honestly, I am more scared of the Clippers than I am of either the Spurs or the Trail Blazers.  The Thunder need to make sure that the Clippers role players don't get hot scoring like they let Mike Miller, Tony Allen and Courtney Lee do against Memphis.  If they can force the Clippers to run through Paul and Griffin, along with contributions from Jordan and Crawford, they should be in good shape.  But ultimately, this series will come down to turnovers.  Both teams thrive in transition.  The Thunder committed a lot of uncharacteristic turnovers against Memphis, and the Clippers will be quick to pounce on those opportunities should they arrive.  Likewise, the Thunder are very adept at turning lose balls into fast break points.  The matchups may not all go their way, but if the Thunder can limit their turnovers and force some on defense, along with limit the amount of consistent scorers for the Clippers, they should advance to the Western Conference Finals.\n Prediction: Thunder in 7 (Game 1 - Thunder, Game 2 - Clippers, Game 3 - Clippers, Game 4 - Thunder, Game 5 - Thunder, Game 6 - Clippers, Game 7 - Thunder)\nRead more Thunder rumors, news and opinion on our Oklahoma City Thunder page",

                    "body": "Fresh off of a pair of game sevens, the Clippers and Thunder are finally set to tip off on a playoff matchup that has been brewing even since Los Angeles acquires Chris Paul.  You have CP3 returning to the city he once called home in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Blake Griffin returning to his actual home and a building full of Sooner fans that have turned their backs on him and two of the most exciting offensive teams in the league.  It has all of the makings for yet another classic series in what has already been an incredible post-season, and here's what the Clippers will have to focus on if they want to punch their ticket to the Western Conference Finals.\n For three years running the Memphis Grizzlies have provided a solid blue print on how to stop the Thunder.  With a Defensive Player of the Year in Marc Gasol anchoring their defense downlow, they've pestered Kevin Durant to no end, often forcing Russell Westbrook to jack up tough shots in hero mode.  Watch the tape and it's clear that the Grizzlies' sole focus on defense is to make sure that Durant does not beat them.  It's easy to say, but this is the team that has had the most sustained success in doing so.\n It's easy to look at how much Durant and Westbrook struggled in round one and be optimistic about slowing them down in this series, but there is a big problem for the Clippers here: They don't have Tony Allen.\n Allen is some unnatural combination of brute strength, genius instincts, clairvoyant anticipation and perpetual peskiness.  If there was one purpose for Allen to be in the league, it would be to guard Durant, a scrawny lightweight that can't fight him off and isn't assertive to demand the ball.  Many would refer to Matt Barnes as a pest, but he's nowhere close to the defender that Allen is, at least in the context of guarding Durant.  Barnes is long and decently athletic, but he's just not capable of locking down Durant in the way that Allen has.\n The Clippers simply don't have the individual personnel to guard Durant.  Barnes is going to guard him for most of the series and I'm sure Danny Granger will get a shot at some point as well.  Doc Rivers may even want to try and buy a couple of minutes with Reggie Bullock guarding Durant, as he seemed to have a little bit of success during a brief stint against KD during the regular season.  Or perhaps it is Jared Dudley that gets inserted back into the rotation to give Durant a different look.  While it's nice to have options, none of these guys are going to shutdown Durant like Allen did.\n What's more, the Clippers don't really have a second serviceable wing defender that can take on the responsibility of guarding Russell Westbrook like Courtney Lee did for Memphis.  Chris Paul did a masterful job of chasing Steph Curry around against the Warriors, but unlike Curry, who Paul could attach himself to in hopes that Curry would head towards the rim, a place where he was made uncomfortable by DeAndre Jordan's size, getting into Westbrook's hip is a recipe for disaster, because he's got the size and athleticism to finish at the rim.  Throw in the fact that Paul is dealing with a hamstring issue and we may end up with Darren Collison guarding Westbrook for stretches in this series, which I'm sure would lead to a lot of Bruin-on-Bruin crime.\n So what can the Clippers do?  Well, they have to follow Memphis' gameplan as best they can.  They have to do everything that they can make Durant and Westbrook into facilitators, even though Durant is likely to shoot a far better percentage than he did in round one.  Los Angeles will have to make sure they sag off of every non-shooter that the Thunder have, abandoning Thabo Sefolosha, Kendrick Perkins and Reggie Jackson to pack the paint and throw extra bodies at Durant and Westbrook.  One interesting thing to watch is whether or not Scotty Brooks stays with his new starting line-up - Caron Butler in for Sefolosha at the two guard - or if Sefolosha gets back into the rotation to guard Chris Paul.\n The Clippers will also have to do the best they can at keeping the pressure off of DeAndre Jordan.  As good as he was against the Warriors, Oklahoma City's two stars will relentlessly attack the rim unlike Golden State's best players because they know they'll get bailed out by the whistle.  Jordan will have to be an animal on the backline of the defense for LA to win, but the Clippers also must make sure that he isn't defending every shot at the rim because they can't survive for long with their back-up bigs on the floor if he gets into foul trouble.\n One way to make Jordan's job easier is to stop having Griffin show hard on high screen-and-rolls.  This has been a big part of the Clippers' pick-and-roll defense all season long, but if Griffin doesn't properly deter Westbrook from turning the corner and if Paul doesn't recover quick enough, it can open up the lane for him to drive right at Jordan.\n Westbrook threw up a wild shot here, but you can see how this could hurt the Clippers.  Not only does Westbrook go right at Jordan, which presents a good chance of a foul being called if he takes it to Jordan's body, but Ibaka is also in pretty good rebounding position on the miss. Instead, Los Angeles could have Griffin sag to the free throw line to contain the dribble and entice the pull-up jumper, something the Grizzlies did expertly.  Baiting Westbrook into mid-range shots is one of the key things in beating the Thunder because not only is it an efficient shot, it's keeping him from getting anyone else involved or drawing fouls at the rim.\n Of course, if they are going to use that strategy, they'll have to make sure that their help defenders don't lose track of Durant.  Digging down or watching the ball for even a split second can be a deadly mistake against him.\n The key to this series for the Clippers will be defending as a team anytime that Durant or Westbrook has the ball and sending loads of help their way to make sure Oklahoma City's questionable supplemental players are relied on heavily.  At some point, Durant and Westbrook will abandon their trust in their teammates and they'll start to try to takeover themselves, and so long as the Clippers are working together to throw them out of rhythm, Los Angeles has a great shot to take them down.\n We've talked about how important it is to make Oklahoma City's role players beat you, but inevitably any game against the Thunder winds up being 2-on-5 at some point.  Against an offensively challenged team like Memphis, OKC had just enough to get by, but against the more well-rounded Clippers, they may struggle to keep up.\n That's why it is important for guys like J.J. Redick, who struggled mightily from the field against the Warriors up until his strong game seven, Barnes, Granger, Collison and Crawford to come up big to make sure the Clippers have enough firepower to outscore Durant and Westbrook.  You'd feel a little bit better about relying on the supporting cast if Paul was 100% healthy, as he'd be able to take on a sizable scoring load, but with his hamstring bothering him and the possibility of a longer defender like Sefolosha picking him up, there's a good chance that Los Angeles will need at least two of those five guys to have strong games for the Clippers to win, and maybe even three in Oklahoma City's home building.\n What's good is that the Thunder aren't quite as troublesome defensively as the Warriors were.  During the middle of the series, Golden State stopped caring about who was guarding who and just switched everything no matter who was involved.  They often would up with their shooting guard guarding DeAndre Jordan or some other wacky matchup and it worked because Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are a sublime defensive trio.  While the Thunder have a great defensive scheme, they aren't quite as flexible as the Warriors were in the first round and their weaknesses can easily be exploited if the Clippers' shooters play well.\n The Thunder pack the paint defensively and go out of their way to have their wings drop into the paint to clutter the lane.  This philosophy led to OKC surrendering the third most three-point attempts in the league this season, but they may be fine with the tradeoff seeing as opponents only shot 56.6% in the restricted area against them, the second best mark in the league behind the Pacers.  It's up to the Clippers to make sure they take advantage of this strategy by knocking down their open looks when they get them.\n Crawford may be the guy the Clippers need to step up the most.  He torched Oklahoma City during the regular season with a 36-point outing on top of a pair of good games and his ability to shoot off dribble and the catch is big against the Thunder.  If he gets going not only can he force the Thunder to stop sagging off of him, which would open up the lane a bit, he can also get Scott Brooks to put Sefolosha on him instead of CP3.  On the other end, Crawford is unreliable, but the Thunder usually offer opponents a couple of non-threats to hide poor defenders on like Sefolosha, Butler or Derek Fisher.  Crawford is coming off a pretty good showing in the Warriors series, and 18-20 points a game from him in this series could be the difference.\n Redick is a huge factor as well.  The Clippers love to run him off of screens and Redick has become very good at getting into pick-and-rolls when he receives the ball rather than just shooting all of the time.  That ability for the Clippers to essentially run rotating pick-and-rolls on different sides of the floor can extend Oklahoma City's big men and create some space under the basket.  It's also important, of course, for Redick to knockdown the shots he gets, particularly in transition, as this is sure to be an up-and-down series.\n Honestly, if Crawford and Redick play well for most of this series, anything the Clippers get from Collison or Granger will be gravy.  Obviously, they need them to do something so that the offense doesn't die when Griffin or Paul need a break, but the Thunder aren't going to get much from their role players, so there is not a huge responsibility for the Clippers to get great performances from everyone on the roster.  What the Clippers need is their shooters to adequately space the floor so that they can exploit Oklahoma City's biggest weakness, and if Crawford can consistently be a third scorer, then Los Angeles will have an important advantage over the Thunder.\n The whole season has been building to this point.  Ever since Paul went out with his shoulder injury, the Clippers have relied more and more on Griffin.  Now that a gimpy Paul is in for his second straight series of dealing with long and athletic defenders, Los Angeles has never needed Griffin to step and become a superstar more than now.\n It starts with Griffin as a scorer.  In the first round, the Thunder single covered Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph in the post, allowing the two Grizzlie bigs to attack Kendrick Perkins and Serge Ibaka one-on-one without sending help.  I imagine it will be more of the same in this series against Griffin.  The only reason Perkins is still employed by the Thunder is so that he can guard post players, and he did a great job against Randolph in the first round.  Griffin will have to use his speed to render Perkins' superior size and strength moot, and once Serge Ibaka is switched onto him, he'll have to make sure he muscles his way deep into the paint to negate Ibaka's shotblocking ability.\n Admittedly, it's tough to ask Griffin to dominate this series with his post scoring, so it's a good thing that he can shred Oklahoma City's defense in another way.  Because the Thunder like to pack the paint, Griffin can use their aggressiveness to his advantage on pick-and-rolls by drawing the second big away from the rim and getting any easy pass to Jordan for a lob or dunk.\n With Ibaka busy preventing Redick's dribble penetration at the foulline, Steven Adams must step up to guard Griffin on the roll.  Because Ibaka has contained Redick, there's no reason for Durant to drop down, at least until Adams leaves Jordan to guard Griffin.  But at that point, a rotation by Durant would mean very little because Griffin has already lobbed the ball up for a dunk.  And had Durant been there in time to keep Jordan from getting the easy bucket, Griffin has proven to be capable of making that pass to the corner to Dudley for three.\n Griffin can also use a trick called \"shorting\" on pick-and-rolls that allows him to slip from the top of the key without ever setting a screen, creating a two-on-one mismatch in the paint for the Clipper bigs.  Yet again we see Adams step up, leaving the rim unprotected for Jordan to attack.\n Mixing in pick-and-rolls and getting Griffin good looks in the post, preferably in semi-transition where Blake is able to get good position and make a quick move against an unset defense, will allow Griffin to pick apart the Thunder's interior defense.  Expecting him to be an efficient scorer all throughout this series may be a bit much, but he's definitely got the ability to be effective downlow even against good post defenders.  And should the Thunder ever chose to go small in this series, then Griffin can start going to work on Oklahoma City's perimeter defense by drawing help and kicking it out to shooters.\n 100% or not, Chris Paul is definitely going to have a huge impact on this series, but it's unlikely that he'll be able to carry a massive scoring load.  This puts a big burden on Griffin, but if this entire season has been any indication, he'll be up for the challenge and then some.",

                    "body": "If you thought the first round of these NBA playoffs have been spectacular, just wait until the conference semifinals begin on Monday night.\n In a stacked Western Conference, the second-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder will meet the third-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference Semifinals.\n It will be a matchup between two of the top five offenses in the NBA.  The Clippers (107.9 PPG) were the top scoring team during the regular season while the Thunder ranked fifth (106.2 PPG).\n Both teams are coming off seven game series in the first round.  The Clippers were able to keep their emotions in check and focus on winning during a controversy involving team owner Donald Sterling that revealed itself last week, ultimately leading to Sterling's lifetime ban from league by new commissioner Adam Silver.\n The teams split the season series 2-2.  The Clippers won the first game in November 111-103, with Griffin showcasing his overall skills, finishing with 22 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists and three steals.  Durant had 33 points for the Thunder.  For the second game in Oklahoma City, Durant scored when he wanted to and created for others at will as the Thunder won by 14.\n In the third matchup, Durant scored 42 points and had 10 assists but the Clippers were able to overcome that thanks to Jamal Crawford, who started in place of the injured J.J. Redick and scored 36 points.  Westbrook was the MVP of the final matchup scoring 30 points, snatching 11 rebounds and dishing out six assists in a Thunder win.\n Griffin vs. Ibaka- Here's a quick video of what Ibaka did to Griffin last season.  Ibaka is one of the few power forwards who can match Griffin's physicality and athleticism inside.  Griffin has played at an MVP caliber level this season, averaging 24.7 PPG in the four games this season against the Thunder.  He will need to attack Ibaka early and often to try and get him into foul trouble.  The Thunder have other bodies to throw at Griffin like Nick Collison, Steven Adams and at times Durant.  Griffin's effectiveness could be the key to the series.\n Paul vs. Westbrook- Two of the top five point guards in the game.  Paul is a master of controlling the tempo and creating shots for others in the flow of the offense while Westbrook is an explosive athlete who can take over a game in transition and play above the rim.  Both guards are very good defenders but Westbrook has the size advantage and will look to post up the smaller Paul.  Against Memphis, Westbrook switched from being a scorer and became a facilitator, and the Thunder won the last two games because of it.  If he plays the role of facilitator, the Thunder will be in prime position to win the series.\n Prediction- Thunder in six games.  Durant will be the difference maker and the overall matchups are more favorable for the Thunder than the Clippers.",

The Oklahoman ran that headline describing Kevin Durant, who will probably be handed the league's MVP award before a home game during this series.\n Durant responded with 36 and 33 points in the final two games against the Memphis Grizzlies, both double-digit victories for OKC in elimination games during the first round.\n \"He's one of the best players on the planet,\" Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks said of his superstar.  \"He's going to continue to help us win games and move us forward, not only with his shot-making, but his playmaking.\" \"\nSadly, the Clippers' headlines were of a much more serious tone during the first round against Golden State.\n Their owner, Donald Sterling, was caught on tape making racist comments.  It affected the team in its Game 4 loss, then, before Game 5, NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life and prompted the Board of Governors to force Sterling to sell the team.\n Through this tumultuous time, the third-seeded Clippers hung on for a Game 7 win over the Warriors.\n \"I just wanted us to win the game,\" said Clippers coach Doc Rivers.  \"Not because of all of this stuff, but this team just needed this win.  I thought our guys fought.  The adversity, they went through it.  It drained them and they found enough energy to find a way to win the game.\" \"\nEach team features two superstars.\n For the Thunder, Durant averaged 29.9 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.6 blocks against the Grizz.  Granted, Durant shot 44 percent and 32 percent from 3-point range, which are low numbers by his standards.\n Russell Westbrook averaged 25.6 points in the Grizzlies series, but he took 23 shot attempts a game, which was the same number as Durant.  Westbrook shot 38 percent from the field and committed 4.9 turnovers per game.\n For LA, Chris Paul is the leader and scored 22 points and handed out 14 assists in the Game 7 victory.  Blake Griffin blossomed into a well-rounded offensive machine.\n And special mention to Clippers big man DeAndre Jordan, who averaged 12.1 points, 15.1 rebounds and 4.0 blocks against the Warriors.\n During the season, the two squads were evenly matched.  The Thunder have won five of the last seven meetings, but the two sides split four games this season and each team managed a win on the road.\n The Thunder were eliminated in this round last season by the Grizzlies when Westbrook got hurt in the first round against the Houston Rockets.\n The Clippers have never advanced past the second round in franchise history.",

Westbrook and Durant can only be matched by one duo in the NBA, the Clippers' Paul and Griffin.  But the Thunder play much better defense.  The matchups for the Clippers will be difficult, too.  They have no answer for Durant, and while Paul can frustrate opposing point guards, he risks being run over by his bigger, faster and stronger counterpart.  There's also the lingering factor of the Donald Sterling scandal, which could distract the Clippers but also could galvanize them.\n Why Los Angeles will win: The best offense in the NBA can get scary.  Center DeAndre Jordan's pairing with Griffin should make it difficult for the Thunder to regularly use their smaller lineups, and neither Steven Adams nor Kendrick Perkins offers much on offense.  Paul has a long history of stepping up his games against other elite point guards and would relish the opportunity to expose Westbrook's inconsistencies.  Westbrook and Durant both have to carry huge loads, while the Clippers are more balanced.  Finally, Doc Rivers is a proven championship-caliber coach, while Scott Brooks has drawn a lot of heat lately for misusing his stars.\n Did you know?

                    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Clippers just barely escaped a storm that threatened to pull them under because of all that swirled around them while they were in the midst of the forces.\n And now the Clippers are about to enter the face of an even stronger storm in the form of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n It took seven games for the Clippers to get by the Golden State Warriors, the final game Saturday a classic for its intensity and pressure-filled moments in the win-or-go-home contest at Staples Center.\n But the Clippers survived, winning the series, 4-3.  And they even survived, for now, the ongoing drama that is the Donald Sterling controversy of him being banned by the NBA and being forced to sell his team because of disparaging remarks about African-Americans.\n Next up for the Clippers will be playing Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Thunder in Oklahoma City on Monday night.\n The two teams split the four-game regular-season series, both winning a game on the other's home court.\n The Thunder also survived a first-round seven-game series with the Memphis Grizzlies, winning Game 7 at home.\n \"It'll be interesting to see what kind of pace the game will be on Monday, I think for both teams,\" Clippers guard J.J. Redick said.  \"But we'll get our rest and we'll figure it out.\" \"\nHere is a matchup breakdown of the two teams:\nStarting guards: Chris Paul and Redick against Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook and Caron Butler.  Paul is considered the best point guard in the NBA and Westbrook the most athletic point guard in the league.  Redick and Butler both are at their best moving without the basketball.\n EDGE: Even.\n Starting forwards: Blake Griffin and Matt Barnes against the Thunder's Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka.  It'll be fun to watch the reportedly soon to be NBA most valuable player in small forward Durant and MVP candidate in power forward Griffin.  Durant led the league in scoring during the regular season, averaging 32.0 points per game.  He averaged 29.9 points per game in seven playoff games against Memphis.  Ibaka is a really good defender and shot blocker.  Barnes will have the task of trying to slow down Durant.\n EDGE: Thunder.\n Starting centers: DeAndre Jordan and Kendrick Perkins.  Both are really good defenders, though they do it differently.  Jordan is active, blocking and altering shots.  And he rebounds and runs the floor better than most centers.  Perkins uses his strength and smarts to defend players down low.\n EDGE: Clippers\nBenches: Jamal Crawford, the NBA's sixth-man-of-the-year winner, and Darren Collison were the only productive reserves for the Clippers against the Warriors.  Oklahoma City has gotten good work from Reggie Jackson, Nick Collison, Steven Adams and Derek Fisher.\n EDGE: Even.\n Coaches: Doc Rivers won an NBA championship in Boston in 2008 and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals.  Plus, he has guided the Clippers during their most difficult time in dealing with the Sterling saga.  Thunder coach Scott Brooks took the Thunder to the 2012 NBA Finals, where it lost to the Miami Heat.\n EDGE: Clippers\nIntangibles: Paul's health.  He has been dealing with a sprained left thumb and an injured right hamstring; Westbrook.  Will he defer some to Durant or take volume shots?",

                    "body": "1.  Who is the x-factor in this series?\n Seth Partnow, (@WhrOffnsHppns): I have to say Chris Paul's health.  Westbrook is a physically punishing player under the best of times, and if you're coming into a seven-game series already hurting, that's less than ideal.\n Law Murray, (@1maddskillz): Jamal Crawford, the Sixth Man of the Year.  No one on Oklahoma City's roster is trying to check him, as he dropped 20, 18, and 36 points in the games he played against the Thunder this season.  Two of those games came in November, when Doc Rivers was still figuring things out with his personnel.  He didn't play in OKC's win in L.A. last month.  It's a damn shame, by the way, that these games are going to be in Oklahoma City, not Seattle.  I wonder how Jamal will feel about that...\n Andrew Han, (@andrewthehan): De.  An.  Dre.  Jor.  Dan. He was a terror for much of the first round, punishing the mobile and agile Golden State Warriors on the glass.  If he can do the same against the Thunder and also continue to alter shots at the rim, it allows the Clippers' wings to play the tighter, more aggressive brand of defense needed to contain the likes of Durant and Westbrook.\n Fred Katz, (@FredKatz): Thunder minutes distribution.  If Scott Brooks decides to give major minutes to Derek Fisher and Kendrick Perkins, it'll allow the Clipper guards to score like crazy along with letting DeAndre Jordan man the paint on the defensive end.  If Brooks goes small, however, that makes things a little harder for the Clippers.\n Patrick James, (@patrickmjames): The Clippers' outside shooters.  OKC is both susceptible to allowing threes and less than fantastic when it comes to shooting them.  If Redick, Crawford, Barnes, and others knock down shots at a good clip, it could help swing the series.  We've talked all year about how the team almost never loses when they make nine or more threes -- let's see whether that holds up this week.\n Seerat Sohi, (@DamianTrillard): Kendrick Perkins, or better yet, Scott Brooks.  He improved upon norms over the last few games of the Memphis series but Brooks' adamancy to use Perkins ahead of the Thunder's smaller, more potent lineups -- or even seven-foot rookie rebounding machine Steven Adams -- has spelt the Thunder's demise in more than a few instances.  If Perkins plays less than 20 minutes per game, Oklahoma wins.  If not, well, they're still really good.  But it's not a guarantee they'll be successful.\n Jovan Buha, (@jovanbuha): Matt Barnes.  It goes without saying that his defense on Kevin Durant will likely determine this series.  But the Clippers have struggled with inconsistent rebounding and three-point shooting all season, and Barnes has the ability to tilt both categories in their favor.  With him on the floor against OKC, the Clippers had a +6.0 net rating this season.  When he moved to the bench, their net rating dropped to -5.0.  That's an 11-point swing per 100 possessions.  In the words of Andrew Han, the Ciippers need 2013 Matt Barnes.\n 2.  The Clippers win if...\n Partnow: I have to cop out of answering this one.  There are so many moving parts on both teams that pointing to any one thing as key beforehand is foolish.  Things that CAN'T happen for the Clips include Barnes foul trouble and Blake getting caught up in any nonsense with Steven \"The Ruckus\" Adams.  I think I just made up his MMA name, and I like it.  Prediction: Thunder in six.\n Murray: ...they are good at the line.  Not trying to be cheap about it, but these games project to be high-scoring, close contests.  The biggest difference between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Los Angeles Clippers is at the free-throw line.  While the Grizzlies attempted the second-fewest in the league this past season, the Clippers attempted the second-most.  All of Oklahoma City's big men, in particular, will give up some fouls.  This is big for Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  They should get plenty of free throws.  They need to make a respectable percentage of them, because Oklahoma City will.  Prediction: Clippers in seven.\n Han: ...their three-point shooters hit career averages in percentage.  The Thunder have had a notable weakness all season: they're not very good at defending the long ball.  If the Clippers' shooters can even get to their norm, it will spread the floor in outrageous ways for Paul and Griffin to exploit.  It's also easier to set up a defense when the other team is taking the ball out of the hoop.  We'll know after the first game whether it's Clippers in six or Thunder in seven.  Prediction: Clippers in six.\n Katz: ...G Griffin, Paul and Jordan outplay Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka.  Of course, the complementary players make a difference, but it's going to be hard for Griffin to average 6.3 rebounds per game in another series and get a Clippers win.  Conversely, if Kevin Durant plays like he did against Tony Allen (unlikely, by the by), the Thunder may not be able to pull it out.  In its simplest form, the Clippers' big three has to outplay that of the Thunder.  Prediction: Thunder in seven.\n James: ...C Chris Paul defends like he did in Round 1.  Without an elite one-on-one wing defender like Tony Allen, it's unlikely that the Clippers will shut down Kevin Durant.  But if Chris Paul can frustrate Russell Westbrook and the team can force turnovers, then the Clippers can play to their strengths in transition.  It goes without saying that Westbrook is a different cover than Steph Curry, but Paul's success against Curry shouldn't be ignored.  Prediction: Clippers in six.\n Sohi: ...if Kendrick Perkins plays over 20 minutes per game.  On a serious note, Blake Griffin needs to revert to fringe MVP, rim-destroying, playmaking savant or the Clippers don't have a chance.  That and Chris Paul has to be healthy.  DeAndre Jordan and the funnelling powers of the perimeter will do what they can to stop Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, but if the Clippers want to come out victorious, they need to fight fire with fire.  Should be a fun series.  Prediction: Thunder in seven.\n Buha: ...their Big 3 matches or outplays the Thunder's Big 3.  Few teams can match the star power of the Thunder mano-a-mano -- the Clippers are one of them.  While the role players will certainly play a major factor in this series -- J.J. Redick and Barnes' defense and 3-point shooting, especially -- it'll probably come down to Blake Griffin and Chris Paul negating the offensive production of Durant and Russell Westbrook, and DeAndre Jordan winning the paint war against Serge Ibaka.  Prediction: Clippers in 6.",

                    "body": "Russell Westbrook (0) and Chris Paul offer a contrast in styles, but are two of the best point guards in the NBA.  Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder survived a grueling seven-game first-round series with the Memphis Grizzlies, advancing with a 120-109 win Saturday night.  They go on to face the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference Semifinals after the Clippers survived their own Game 7 Saturday night 126-121 over the Golden State Warriors.  Game 1 is Monday night in Oklahoma City.\n This will be the first-ever playoff meeting between the Thunder and the Clippers, whether it be the Seattle SuperSonics, San Diego Clippers or their predecessor, the Buffalo Braves.\n Perhaps the key adjustment of the first round was Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks sitting down Thabo Sefolosha for the final two games of the series against Memphis and inserting Caron Butler into the starting lineup.\n Butler didn't have overwhelming stats in his two starts -- averaging 11 points and four rebounds and shooting 33.3 percent overall and from 3-point range in 34.8 minutes per game.\n But the Thunder were 2-0 with Butler in the starting lineup, winning by an average of 15.5 points per game.  Contrast that with the first five games of the series, when Oklahoma City was 2-3 and outscored the Grizzlies by 1.3 points per game.\n The Thunder shot 54.9 percent over the final two games of the series, including 45 percent from deep, after shooting 39.7 percent and 28.6 percent from long range in the first five games.\n Looking ahead to the matchup with the Clippers, the teams split the season series 2-2, with each team picking up a road win.  L.A. won at OKC on Feb. 23, 125-117, and the Thunder won in Los Angeles 107-101 on April 9.\n The teams split two games in November, each winning at home.\n In those four games, the Thunder were led by -- who else? -- Kevin Durant.  He shot .441/.292/.837 in the four meetings, averaging 32.5 points, eight assists, 4.5 rebounds and 1.8 steals.  Russell Westbrook had a .397/.235/.727 line, averaging 18.5 points, 6.8 assists, 6.5 rebounds and 1.5 steals, as he appeared in all for meetings against the Clippers.\n Serge Ibaka was very good against L.A., averaging 16.3 points, five rebounds and 2.3 blocks while shooting 65.9 percent.  Butler only played in the April 9 matchup after signing with the Thunder on March 1, playing 20 minutes and scoring four points on 2-of-5 shooting.\n Reggie Jackson didn't have his best performances against the Clippers, averaging 8.5 points in 26 minutes per game with a .353/.364/.750 shooting slash line.\n For the Clippers, Blake Griffin averaged 24.7 points, 10.3 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.3 steals on .493/.500/.706 shooting (he was 1-for-2 from 3-point range).  Chris Paul played in all four meetings and averaged 18.5 points, 12 assists, 6.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals on .455/.333/.850 shooting and DeAndre Jordan checked in with 11.8 points, 11.3 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and 1.3 steals while shooting 64.3 percent overall, but just 40.7 percent (11-for-27) from the foul line.\n The potential X-factor for the Clippers is perennial Sixth Man of the Year candidate Jamal Crawford, who in three games against the Thunder, lit them up for 24.7 points per game on .551/.455/.769 shooting.  On the other hand, J.J. Redick struggled in three games against OKC, shooting 29 percent overall and just 22.2 percent from long range, averaging nine points a game.\n Westbrook vs. Paul is always a fun battle to watch, given the contrasting styles of the two players.\n The Clippers dominated the glass in the four games, 46.8-41.3, and neither team took particularly good care of the basketball, with the Clippers averaging 16.5 turnovers per game to the Thunder's 15.3.\n Shooting wise, the Thunder were at .466/.318/.771 in the four meetings; the Clippers were at .449/.310/.680.\n At the end of the day, this is a matchup between teams who finished with the second- and third-best records in the NBA, respectively (the Thunder were 59-23, the Clippers 57-25).  It's a heavyweight fight and it wouldn't be a surprise if the series played out like one -- expect this to go six or seven games before it's decided.",

                    "body": "The Los Angeles Clippers prevailed through an emotional series and don't get any time to recuperate as they open the Western Conference semifinals against the host Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.  Los Angeles dealt with anger over racist comments spewed by now-banished owner Donald Sterling while fighting off the Golden State Warriors in a hard-fought series that ended Saturday.  The Thunder also went seven games in the opening round, claiming the final two to oust the Memphis Grizzlies.S Second-seeded Oklahoma City was tested mightily by Memphis through five games before the Thunder easily won the final two contests as forward Kevin Durant rediscovered his shooting stroke and Russell Westbrook excelled as an all-around force.  \"We always try to figure out ways to get better,\" Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks told reporters after Saturday's clinching win.  \"We're not mistake-free, but our effort is right on.\" \" The Clippers were somehow able to keep much of their focus on basketball despite the chaos caused by the Sterling situation.  \"It's been a crazy ride for us,\" center DeAndre Jordan told reporters.  \"I commend our guys for sticking with it.  It's been a roller coaster, but we came out and had a job to do and we did it.\" \"TV: 9:30 p.m. ET, TNTABOUT THE CLIPPERS: Jordan was a difference-maker in the middle against Golden State by averaging 12.1 points, 15.1 rebounds and four blocks, and his 106 rebounds surpassed Bob McAdoo's franchise mark (94 for the Buffalo Braves in 1975) for a playoff series.  Power forward Blake Griffin was strong on the scoring front (23.3) but grabbed just 6.3 boards and will be expected to increase that effort while being matched against Oklahoma City's Serge Ibaka.  Point guard Chris Paul (17.4 points, nine assists in the postseason) is bothered by a hamstring injury so it is likely that valuable reserve Darren Collison will find himself defending Westbrook at times to keep Paul from being taxed.  Shooting guard Jamal Crawford and J.J. Redick provide the outside artillery and small forward Matt Barnes has his moments.A ABOUT THE THUNDER: Westbrook put together a contest for the ages with 27 points, 16 assists and 10 rebounds on Saturday to join Boston's Rajon Rondo as the only players with a triple-double in two different Game 7s.  He struggled with his shot for much of the series despite averaging 25.6 points while Durant also found himself under scrutiny while averaging 29.9 points with five 30-point outings.  Durant is expected to be named MVP early this week but that didn't stop the Oklahoma City newspaper from dubbing him \"Mr. Unreliable\" after a couple subpar shooting performances.  Ibaka (13 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.6 blocked shots) is a consistent performer but Oklahoma City will need some better efforts from a supporting cast that includes guard Reggie Jackson and forward Caron Butler.B BUZZER BEATERS 1.  The teams split four regular-season meetings and each team won once on the other's home floor.2.  Durant averaged 32.5 points against the Clippers this season.3.  Jordan, who led the NBA with a 67.6 field-goal percentage in the regular season, shot 75.7 percent against Golden State.P PREDICTION: Thunder 111, Clippers 109",

Oklahoma City won once in Los Angeles, the Clippers won once on the Thunder's home floor.  They've met only once since Feb. 23, and that was the Thunder winning on the road 107-101 in a game that helped Oklahoma City lock up No. 2 in the West.\n Story line: For the Clippers, maybe this series will have some sort of sense of normalcy.  After the unbelievable roller-coaster of Round 1 - a fierce series with Golden State, the lifetime ban of the team's owner over racist comments - dealing with the widely presumed MVP in Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant might actually seem like a welcome change of pace.\n Key matchup I: Russell Westbrook vs. Chris Paul.  Westbrook is as explosive as can be, and Paul is physically banged up with who-knows-how-many injuries along with a certain emotional toll over the Donald Sterling mess.  When these guys go 1-on-1 in this series, the highlight reels will fill quickly.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul has never been to a conference finals, and it's a safe bet that's weighing at least somewhat on his mind.\n Key matchup II: Durant vs. Everybody.  No one person can successfully guard Durant, and Clippers coach Doc Rivers won't disagree.  It's going to take a collective effort, of course, but this is why Rivers went to the Clippers - to find a way to take championship-caliber parts and turn them into a championship team.\n X-factor: Jamal Crawford.  He scored 36 points in a win at Oklahoma City back in February, and comes in riding high after scoring 22 points in the Clippers' Game 7 victory over Golden State.",
