In turn, Obama ribs Galifianakis right back, comparing a third term to a third Hangover movie (\"It just doesn't work\") and praising Bradley Cooper's acting in the movies, saying that actor really \"carried\" those movies to Galifianakis' (fake) chagrin.\n It's hard to imagine the bit wasn't scripted, but even if it was, it showed again that the president understands a punch line, even if it's awkwardly paced.

It didn't really work out very well, did it?\"\nHe then praised Galifianakis' previous interviews, especially one featuring his Hangover co-star Bradley Cooper, which ended with the pair slapping each other.\n \"That was a great show.  He probably carried that movie didn't he?\" said Mr Obama.\n The Between Two Ferns series, which began in 2008, has become a cult hit online.\n A typical recent video, which featured Galifianakis whipping singer Bieber with a belt for his bad behaviour, was watched by 16 million people.\n The comedian's most memorable questions have included:\nGalifianakis and Mr Obama sparred for three-and-a-half minutes before the president revealed his real motive for appearing on the show, asking \"Have you heard of healthcare.g gov?\".\n The comedian replied under his breath \"here we go\", before adding: \"OK, let's get this out of the way, what did you come here to plug?\"\nMr Obama went on to explain why he felt it was important for young people to sign up for health insurance in the US, before the deadline on 31 March.\n The interview ended with President Obama hitting a panic button, which prompted the standard black set to drop to the ground and reveal a room that appeared to be in The White House.\n \"Thanks for letting me shoot my show here all these years,\" said Galifianakis, claiming former President George Bush had given him clearance to film in the Diplomatic Room.",
