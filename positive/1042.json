Television images showed the jet on the runway as fire trucks and ambulances waited nearby.\n\nGatwick said several passengers suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe incident caused major disruption to travelers. Gatwick said the airport's only runway would be closed until at least 6 p.m. (1 p.m. EST) as the Virgin plane was inspected. No flights were departing, and inbound flights were being diverted to other airports.\n\nThe airline said the plane undertook \"a non-standard landing procedure\" because of \"a technical issue with one of the landing gears.\"\n\nThe airport said the flight, VS43, took off at about 11:45 a.m. Monday. Flight-tracking websites show it circled off the coast of southwest England before turning back to Gatwick, south of London. It circled near the airport, and photos appeared to show a set of wheels on its right-side landing gear had not fully descended.\n\nEmergency services were on standby for the landing -- standard procedure when a plane has to land with a technical problem. The plane's emergency chutes were not deployed and passengers disembarked by stairs.\n\nPassenger Mike Kaufman said the crew remained calm and professional throughout the four-hour crisis.\n\n\"Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed,\" he told Sky News from the plane.",

He said: 'A lot were worried, some crying. They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.'\n\nBut the terrified passengers then cheered and applauded the hero pilot - named only by passengers as 'Dave' - after he landed the jumbo jet safely with only a few on board suffering minor injuries.\n\nTerrified passengers who had endured a nerve-racking few hours circling above the south coast after the problem was identified spoke of their relief as the pilot of Flight VS43 managed a 'textbook' landing.\n\nPassengers, many heading for a New Year break in Las Vegas, adopted the brace position and emergency services were on standby as the giant aircraft, packed with 447 passengers and 15 crew, came into land.\n\nAnd there was spontaneous applause as the pilot pulled off the delicate landing without a hitch and the jet rolled safely to a stop.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was 'anxious, a lot were worried, some crying.

Our priority now is to look after our passengers and crew'.\n\nChief Executive of Virgin Atlantic, Craig Kreeger, said: 'I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans.\n\n'We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\n\n'I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response.

You want to have as little fuel as possible on board because fuel burns so you get rid of it.\"\n\nUsing up fuel also makes the plane less heavy, which Mr Learmount said would reduce the risk of gear collapse.\n\nMr Learmount compared a gear fault to a mechanical problem on an ironing board: \"You're putting up your ironing board and you find that when you put the leg round against the stop, the stop is loose and so the ironing board is not stable, so one of the components which provides a mechanical lock to keep it down or up is not doing the job it's supposed to do.\"\n\n6:17 pm 'Zero chance of getting hurt'\n\nThe crew would not have known there was a problem with the gear before they set off, he explained.\n\n\"If you knew before you set off, you wouldn't set off, but I suspect that the first time that they knew about it was after take off when they tried to pull the gear up and something didn't work exactly as it should do,\" he said.\n\nMr Learmount said pilots are trained to be able to deal with this sort of fault.\n\nHe said: \"There was no real risk. A few times a year a plane lands with one gear leg not extended or something like that, and sometimes they say it is worse to do that and land lopsided than land with all the gears up.\"\n\nHe added: \"The chances of this happening are pretty low and if it does the chances of you getting hurt are almost zero, even if the gear fails completely.\"\n\nAsked how frequently this sort of fault occurs, Mr Learmount said: \"I should think a couple of times a year for all the airlines in the UK.\"\n\n6:21 pm Virgin chief exec praise\n\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said: \"I am very pleased to confirm that all customers and crew have now disembarked the VS43 flight to Las Vegas, which returned to Gatwick airport this afternoon following a problem with one of the landing gear.\n\n\"I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans. We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\"\n\nHe went on: \"I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response. I understand that people have already been phoning our contact centre - from the plane - to make sure that they are booked on tomorrow's special flight to Las Vegas.\n\n\"I want to reassure them that we'll make sure there's a seat for everyone and we really look forward to making sure they're in Vegas for an amazing New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I would like to thank all of the Virgin Atlantic crew and colleagues, who responded with the absolute professionalism and care for our customers that we would expect.\"\n\n6:36 pm Brace position\n\nPassenger Hardeek Desai told BBC News that the passengers were told the fault was \"hydraulic\", that fuel would be coming out of the right wing, and that this was a normal procedure.\n\nHe said passengers were told 10 to 15 minutes in advance that they would have to adopt the brace position on landing.\n\n\"For my mind, personally, I was a bit worried, thinking what's going to happen. It doesn't really seem normal that fuel is coming out of the wing. I was slightly worried but just trying to keep calm and listen to what the staff were telling us.\n\n\"Around 30 seconds before we actually hit the ground, we were told to adopt the brace.\n\n\"At that stage it was literally just everyone shouting 'brace' and people just screaming and shouting. Everyone was a bit worried about what was going on.\n\n6:58 pm Balpa chairman praise\n\nBalpa chairman Captain Brendan O'Neal said: \"These pilots have had to put into practise their years of training and experience to keep their aircraft and passengers safe today. They did a very professional job in difficult circumstances.\n\n\"Pilots across the UK and across all airlines know that although incidents like this are rare, they could happen to any of us, and we have huge respect for the crews who fly with such skill and professionalism when it is needed.\n\n\"On behalf of the British Airline Pilots' Association, I want to pay tribute to the crew for keeping the passengers on this flight safe.\"\n\nHe said he was confident the cause of the landing gear failure would be identified quickly and resolved.\n\n7:13 pm Live coverage concluded\n\nOur live coverage of the Virgin Atlantic mid-air drama has now come to an end.\n\nAfter five hours in the air, passengers were relieved to have landed at Gatwick safely.\n\nTheir flight had been travelling to Las Vegas from London Gatwick when it developed problems with the landing gear.\n\nAfter several hours of circling over the south of England and fuel burning, the plane attempted an emergency landing at the airport it had left from.\n\nPassengers have described how afraid many of the more than 400 people on board were as the staff told them to assume the brace position.\n\nFortunately though, the skilled pilot was able to bring the plane down in what was described as a 'textbook landing'.",

Virgin said it had been \"fantastic flying\".\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane as it was circling, passenger Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nMr Crane, who is with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nPassenger Mike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been \"textbook\".\n\nInterviewed for Sky News, he went on: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm, experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem.\n\n\"The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.\"\n\nFrom the back of my camera the state of VIR43Es undercarriage on its fly. pic.twitter.com/HDWhwReMG1 -- Samuel Pilcher (@SamPilcher)\n\nDecember 29, 2014\n\nMr Kaufman continued: \"People got used to the idea that we were going to have to land back at Gatwick. The crew were very calm and that made the passengers calm.\"\n\nAsked what was going through his mind, Mr Kaufman said: \"People in the row with me were saying 'We want this over and done with'. We thought we'd be fine but you're never sure.\n\n\"Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now\n\n\"We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nA spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: \"There appears to have been a technical problem with the landing gear but the pilot seems to have done a very professional job in getting the plane down safely.\n\n\"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"",

Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nA spokesman for Gatwick airport said that all the passengers had disembarked from the plane and that \"some minor injuries\" had been reported. Virgin Atlantic could not confirm that there had been any injuries.\n\nThe runway at Gatwick was closed until at least 6pm with incoming flights diverted and departing ones delayed.\n\nEmergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft, with 447 passengers and 15 crew aboard, came into land.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nMr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nMike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been \"textbook\".\n\nInterviewed for Sky News, he went on: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem.\n\n\"The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.\"\n\nMr Kaufman told Sky News: \"Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now.\n\n\"We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nA spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: \"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"\n\nThe jet turned back soon after taking off late this morning and circled as it lost fuel ahead of what Virgin described as a \"a non-standard landing procedure\".\n\nDramatic photographs showed the jumbo jet landing with the right-side wing landing gear not deployed.\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said some passengers suffered minor injuries and the runway was closed until at least 6pm.\n\nHe said: \"Virgin Atlantic flight VS043 has landed safely after returning to Gatwick due to a technical fault. Following the emergency landing, passengers have disembarked the aircraft via stairs. At this time, only minor injuries have been reported.\n\n\"The runway has been closed until the aircraft can be removed from the runway and, based on current predictions, it is not expected to reopen until at least 6pm.\n\n\"Currently no flights are departing Gatwick and inbound flights are being diverted to other airports. We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter.\"\n\nSussex Police Chief Superintendent Martin Walker said: \"Our co-ordinated partnership response is part of a well-rehearsed emergency procedure.\n\n\"We are delighted that the plane has landed safely and we will continue to support the operation where we're needed.\"\n\nPassenger Holly Jackson said the crew tried to \"deliberately bounce\" the plane to get the faulty landing gear back into position.\n\nShe told Sky News: \"They said this was a precautionary procedure, or something like that . But it didn't work and we were told we would have to get into the brace position for a landing and it was then that everybody did start to get scared.\"\n\nShe said thoughts went through her mind that, in situations like this, either \"everybody is safe or no one is\". But she added: \"The captain did amazingly. You would not have even known there was something wrong with the plane from that landing.\"\n\nAsked if she still planned to go on to Las Vegas, she replied: \"I'm giving that up.\"\n\nPassenger Hardeek Desai told BBC News that the passengers were told the fault was \"hydraulic\", that fuel would be coming out of the right wing, and that this was a normal procedure.\n\nHe said passengers were told 10 to 15 minutes in advance that they would have to adopt the brace position on landing.\n\n\"For my mind, personally, I was a bit worried, thinking what's going to happen. It doesn't really seem normal that fuel is coming out of the wing. I was slightly worried but just trying to keep calm and listen to what the staff were telling us.\n\n\"Around 30 seconds before we actually hit the ground, we were told to adopt the brace.\n\n\"At that stage it was literally just everyone shouting 'brace' and people just screaming and shouting. Everyone was a bit worried about what was going on.\n\n\"No one knew what was going on because we all had our heads down, and we didn't know whether the plane was going to be balanced or not because we were told that one of the wheels wasn't going to come out.\"\n\nHe added: \"As soon as they started to shout 'brace', everyone more or less panicked.\"\n\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said: \"I am very pleased to confirm that all customers and crew have now disembarked the VS43 flight to Las Vegas, which returned to Gatwick airport this afternoon following a problem with one of the landing gear.\n\n\"I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans. We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\"\n\nHe went on: \" I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response. I understand that people have already been phoning our contact centre - from the plane - to make sure that they are booked on tomorrow's special flight to Las Vegas.\n\n\"I want to reassure them that we'll make sure there's a seat for everyone and we really look forward to making sure they're in Vegas for an amazing New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I would like to thank all of the Virgin Atlantic crew and colleagues, who responded with the absolute professionalism and care for our customers that we would expect.\"\n\nBalpa chairman Captain Brendan O'Neal said: \"These pilots have had to put into practise their years of training and experience to keep their aircraft and passengers safe today. They did a very professional job in difficult circumstances.\n\n\"Pilots across the UK and across all airlines know that although incidents like this are rare, they could happen to any of us, and we have huge respect for the crews who fly with such skill and professionalism when it is needed.\n\n\"On behalf of the British Airline Pilots' Association, I want to pay tribute to the crew for keeping the passengers on this flight safe.\"\n\nHe said he was confident the cause of the landing gear failure would be identified quickly and resolved.\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said: \"The runway at Gatwick airport reopened at 7.03pm following the earlier emergency landing of Virgin Atlantic flight VS43.\n\n\"The airport is now facilitating inbound and outbound flights but it will take some time for normal service to resume. We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter.\n\n\"We are working with our airline partners to provide food, drink and welfare facilities for those passengers whose flights may either have been delayed or cancelled. Gatwick staff and volunteers are being made available throughout the airport to offer passengers advice and the latest information.\"",

Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.'\n\nMeanwhile, Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger met with Mr Williams and the rest of the on board staff to thanks them for their heroics.\n\nThe drama unfolded yesterday after the flight took off from Gatwick airport.\n\nFor several hours, the jumbo jet had circled the airport and made several low-altitude passes so engineers could inspect the landing gear problem, leaving some passengers distraught.\n\nThe plane finally landed with only three quarters of its landing gear down after a set of wheels on the starboard wing refused to drop.\n\nThe person who filmed the drama inside the aircraft later wrote online 'took off from Gatwick and now back at Gatwick, the plane just made an emergency landing with 2 wheels, not a clue how he did it', before describing it as 'crazy'.\n\nToday, Jean Lightman, a close neighbour of Mr Williams, said the pilot was a very 'quiet and unassuming man' who would not want any fanfare about yesterday's incident.\n\nShe told MailOnline: 'He would probably think he's just doing his job. He's a very private sort of guy. He's very unassuming.\n\n'We knew him for a while before we even knew he was a pilot. That's the kind of man he is. We've known him as a neighbour for quite some time.\n\n'He always says hello when we see him out and about, he's a very nice man, a family man. I'm very pleased it all ended well, I would have expected him to be very calm and collected.'\n\nShe said his children were all of school age.\n\nHer husband added: 'We'll have to crack open the bubbly now that we have a hero living next door.'\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Mr Williams is a captain with Virgin Atlantic. It says he has previously worked for Monarch Airlines between 1994 and 1998.\n\nThe profile also states that he was educated at Shebbear College, a boarding school in north Devon.\n\nAfter the landing, terrified passengers - who had endured a nerve-racking few hours circling above the south coast after the problem was identified - spoke of their relief.\n\nPassenger Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said the mood before the landing was 'anxious'. He said: 'A lot were worried, some crying. They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.'\n\nMr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: 'They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.'\n\nDavid Gillespie, 28, and new wife Sandra, from Belfast, were flying to Las Vegas for their honeymoon. Mrs Gillespie, 27, praised Mr Williams and his cabin crew for keeping everyone calm.\n\n'I was terrified. I just thought 'I don't know if we are going to get out of this alive',' she said. 'It was very scary. I'm so glad to be back, we're very relieved.'\n\nPlumber Dean Turner and wife Stacy told how they sent texts with their final goodbyes to relatives as the cabin crew shouted 'brace, brace'. They'd planned the holiday as a treat for their daughter who just had major spinal surgery.\n\nMrs Turner, of Haverigg, Cumbria, said: 'We text our final goodbyes on the plane to family saying we didn't know if we would survive. Me and my husband just looked at each other and thought 'this is it'. It was horrific.'\n\nThe family including Khenya, 16, Ellie, 13, and Maisie, four, had booked a holiday to New York for New Years, but when there were no hotel rooms available they swapped for the \u00a36,500 Las Vegas trip.\n\nMrs Turner said: 'Khenya had major surgery in the summer because she had scoliosis and had to have spinal fusion. This was supposed to be a treat for her.\n\n'She has a heart defect and previously had open heart surgery and survived meningitis. And now with this too, we think we must have a guardian angel watching us. She's blessed.\n\nOf the landing she said: 'He went extremely fast from one side to the other four or five times and that freaked people out.\n\n'We knew he was going to do it but it was horrific. It didn't work so he told us he was going to put on full throttle and drop. It was like zero gravity. It was so quick. It was like being on the world's worst roller coaster.\n\n'People were being sick and people had nosebleeds. There were a lot of scared people. Ellie thought she was going to die. She was screaming on the plane.\n\n'The shaking didn't work so the pilot said he was going to have to burn fuel by flying round and round to make the plane lighter.\n\n'He then told us we were going to do an emergency landing.\n\n'At this point we were terrified. We had to get into the bracing position and the plane went deadly silent. They shouted 'brace, brace' brace' and then 'head down, feet back' over and over again.\n\n'But when we landed it was really smooth, just like any other flight and everybody cheered. The cabin crew and pilot were brilliant. I couldn't fault them.\n\n'They had clean clothes and dinner waiting for us. They offered us another plane but we were all traumatised. They've offered counselling and a course to help us get over our fear of flying now. If we get on a plane again it will have to be a very short flight.\n\n'We've watched things like this on the news but we never thought it would happen to us. My dad was tracking the plane and friends were watching the news.\n\n'Maisie slept through most of it. She had no idea what was going on when I told her to put her head down. Then when we got off the plane she said to me 'is this Las Vegas?''\n\nMike Kaufman, who was on the plane, said it would go down as one of the 'greatest emergencies in history'.\n\nHe said: 'When we landed you can imagine the relief. We were told the plane had a hydraulic problem but were not told that it was the wheels.\n\n'We were told about the brace position around two hours before we landed and ran through it several times before we landed. The crew were calm and that made us calm.\n\n'The landing was smoother than others I've had. It was probably less dramatic on board than it was watching it on TV.\n\n'It is going to go down as one of the greatest emergency landings in history'.\n\nThis morning, passengers from yesterday's grounded flight who wished to continue their journey flew out from Gatwick on a specially-arranged flight at 11am, a Virgin spokesman said.\n\nJust 415 of the original 447 passengers chose to fly today.\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said there had been seven flight cancellations so far today as a knock-on effect of yesterday's incident and that there was an average 20-minute delay across flights.\n\nHe said most services were operating as normal, but he advised passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight before travelling. .\n\nThe flight had left the Sussex airport at 11.44am for Las Vegas in the US, but had to turn back towards London over the Devon coast less than 30 minutes after taking off for America, just before midday.\n\nThe jet landed at Gatwick at 3.45pm where it was met on the runway and surrounded by the emergency services.\n\nFurther footage showed how five fire engines and ground staff raced to the aircraft for safety precautions as it rolled to a stop. There was no immediate evacuation.\n\nNewly-wed website user Alexia posted a picture of her and her husband as they went to board the flight, next to the message: 'We are on our way.'\n\nBut she later tweeted: 'Yup, that's my plane on the BBC News right now! #vegas #v043 will I ever get to Vegas??\n\nAfter the plane landed, she wrote: 'Despite what we've just been through, we actually would quite like to get on another plane #VS43\n\n'Biggest round of applause I've ever heard for a pilot landing. He's kept us informed the whole time of everything #VS43'\n\nOther passengers also took to Twitter after touching down to thank the flight crew.\n\nKelly Coates tweeted: '#VS43 currently on board the Virgin Atlantic Flight VS43. Massive thank you to all of the crew for keeping everyone calm and safe ??'\n\nFate Swan wrote: '@virginatlantic the cabin crew and the pilot have been absolutely amazing and have been keeping us all calm and informed #VS43'\n\nAnother posted: 'Top marks to Dave the pilot and all the excellent Virgin cabin crew for bringing us back to Earth safe and sound. #vs43'.\n\nA spokesman added today that all airplanes have daily maintenance checks, including work on the undercarriage and hydraulic system, and that an investigation had been launched to find out what happened.\n\nThe spokesman refused to comment on whether that particular aircraft had had a faulty landing gear previously.\n\nShe said: 'All aircraft have daily maintenance and regularly undergo checks in the hangar. Work on the undercarriage and hydraulic systems form part of this.\n\n'Virgin Atlantic has now launched an internal investigation to understand the cause of the failure of one of the landing gear systems on the Boeing 747 which operated the VS43 on 29th December. At this stage, until that assessment is complete, it is too early to comment further.'\n\nToday at Gatwick, flights were rearranged and delayed due to yesterday's events. Four arriving flights from Tripoli, Las Vegas, Jakarta and Fort Worth airport were cancelled, while three departing flights to Tripoli, Jakarta and Banjul were also cancelled.\n\nYesterday, after the jet had landed, a Gatwick Airport spokesman said: 'Virgin Atlantic flight VS043 has landed safely after returning to Gatwick due to a technical fault.\n\n'Following the emergency landing, passengers have disembarked the aircraft via stairs. At this time, only minor injuries have been reported.\n\n'The runway has been closed until the aircraft can be removed from the runway and based on current predictions it is not expected to reopen until at least 18.00. Currently no flights are departing Gatwick and inbound flights are being diverted to other airports. We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter.'\n\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesman added: 'We can confirm that flight VS43 has landed safely back at Gatwick. Our priority now is to look after our passengers and crew'.\n\nChief Executive of Virgin Atlantic, Craig Kreeger, said: 'I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans.\n\n'We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\n\n'I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response. I understand that people have already been phoning our contact centre - from the plane - to make sure that they are booked on tomorrow's special flight to Las Vegas. I want to reassure them that we'll make sure there's a seat for everyone and we really look forward to making sure they're in Vegas for an amazing New Year's Eve.'\n\nBefore it landed, the plane made at least one low-level pass over the London Gatwick so engineers could observe the problem.\n\nOthers who saw the jet circling around the airport said the pilot was 'tipping the wings' to try to use gravity to drop down the final part of the landing gear.\n\nAmbulances and fire-and-rescue crews had been on standby as the plane circled the airport in the hours after it took off for the United States.\n\nBefore the successful landing, Virgin announced that the plane would be carrying out a 'non-standard landing procedure' at Gatwick airport.\n\nIn November 1997 a Virgin Atlantic captain Tim Barnby won praise for safely landing a Virgin Atlantic Airbus plane at Heathrow after a landing-gear problem.\n\nThe plane, flying in from Los Angeles carrying 98 passengers and 16 crew, managed to touch down using three instead of four sets of landing gear.",

The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nMr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nMike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been \"textbook\".\n\nInterviewed for Sky News, he went on: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem.\n\n\"The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.\"\n\nMr Kaufman told Sky News: \"Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now.\n\n\"We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nA spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: \"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"\n\nThe jet turned back soon after taking off late this morning and circled as its lost fuel ahead of what Virgin described as a \"a non-standard landing procedure\".\n\nDramatic photographs showed the jumbo jet landing with the right-side wing landing gear not deployed.\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said some passengers suffered minor injuries and runway was closed until at least 6pm.\n\nHe said: \"Virgin Atlantic flight VS043 has landed safely after returning to Gatwick due to a technical fault. Following the emergency landing, passengers have disembarked the aircraft via stairs. At this time, only minor injuries have been reported.\n\n\"The runway has been closed until the aircraft can be removed from the runway and, based on current predictions, it is not expected to reopen until at least 6pm.\n\n\"Currently no flights are departing Gatwick and inbound flights are being diverted to other airports. We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter.\"\n\nSussex Police Chief Superintendent Martin Walker said: \"Our co-ordinated partnership response is part of a well-rehearsed emergency procedure.\n\n\"We are delighted that the plane has landed safely and we will continue to support the operation where we're needed.\"\n\nPassenger Holly Jackson said the crew tried to \"deliberately bounce\" the plane to get the faulty landing gear back into position.\n\nShe told Sky News: \"They said this was a precautionary procedure, or something like that . But it didn't work and we were told we would have to get into the brace position for a landing and it was then that everybody did start to get scared.\"\n\nShe said thoughts went through her mind that, in situations like this, either \"everybody is safe or no one is\". But she added: \"The captain did amazingly. You would not have even known there was something wrong with the plane from that landing.\"\n\nAsked if she still planned to go on to Las Vegas, she replied: \"I'm giving that up.\"\n\nVirgin Atlantic president Sir Richard Branson said on Twitter: \"Well done @VirginAtlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of #VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"",

Before the successful landing, Virgin announced that the plane would be carrying out a \"non-standard landing procedure\" at Gatwick airport.\n\nEast Sussex Fire and Rescue Service were on standby at Gatwick following the alert. However, at about 4pm, television pictures showed the plane at a halt safely on the runway.\n\nThere was apparently no need for an immediate response by emergency crews, although within a few minutes the flashing lights of emergency vehicles could be seen close to the plane.\n\nPictures posted earlier on Twitter of the aircraft circling Gatwick showed damage to the landing gear of the aircraft.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that the jet was flying at a relatively low altitude and that the pilot appeared to be trying to shake the landing gear down. The aircraft circled repeatedly between Gatwick and the South Coast apparently to burn off fuel.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, one of the five landing gears on the Boeing 747 jumbo jet had failed to deploy.\n\nVirgin said: \"Virgin Atlantic can confirm that the plane has landed safely at Gatwick.

Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nA spokesman for Gatwick airport said that all the passengers had disembarked from the plane and that \"some minor injuries\" had been reported.

But it didn't work and we were told we would have to get into the brace position for a landing and it was then that everybody did start to get scared.\"\n\nShe said thoughts went through her mind that, in situations like this, either \"everybody is safe or no one is\". But she added: \"The captain did amazingly. You would not have even known there was something wrong with the plane from that landing.\"\n\nAsked if she still planned to go on to Las Vegas, she replied: \"I'm giving that up.\"\n\nPassenger Hardeek Desai told BBC News that the passengers were told the fault was \"hydraulic\", that fuel would be coming out of the right wing, and that this was a normal procedure.\n\nHe said passengers were told 10 to 15 minutes in advance that they would have to adopt the brace position on landing.\n\n\"For my mind, personally, I was a bit worried, thinking what's going to happen. It doesn't really seem normal that fuel is coming out of the wing. I was slightly worried but just trying to keep calm and listen to what the staff were telling us.\n\n\"Around 30 seconds before we actually hit the ground, we were told to adopt the brace.\n\n\"At that stage it was literally just everyone shouting 'brace' and people just screaming and shouting. Everyone was a bit worried about what was going on.\n\n\"No one knew what was going on because we all had our heads down, and we didn't know whether the plane was going to be balanced or not because we were told that one of the wheels wasn't going to come out.\"\n\nHe added: \"As soon as they started to shout 'brace', everyone more or less panicked.\"\n\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said: \"I am very pleased to confirm that all customers and crew have now disembarked the VS43 flight to Las Vegas, which returned to Gatwick airport this afternoon following a problem with one of the landing gear.\n\n\"I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans. We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\"\n\nHe went on: \" I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response. I understand that people have already been phoning our contact centre - from the plane - to make sure that they are booked on tomorrow's special flight to Las Vegas.\n\n\"I want to reassure them that we'll make sure there's a seat for everyone and we really look forward to making sure they're in Vegas for an amazing New Year's Eve.\n\n\"I would like to thank all of the Virgin Atlantic crew and colleagues, who responded with the absolute professionalism and care for our customers that we would expect.\"",

In 1997, the landing gear on one their Airbus A340-300 jammed and the plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Heathrow.\n\nThe company is 51 percent owned by its founder, British billionaire Richard Branson and 49 percent owned by US carrier Delta Air Lines. It operates from the UK to North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nThe Boeing 747 is generally regarded to be a safe aircraft, although because it has been in such wide use all over the world for over 40 years there have been 49 serious incidents involving the plane.

In a Twitter posting, he said: \"Well done Virgin Atlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nEmergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft came into land. Eyewitnesses reported that the jet was flying at a relatively low altitude, as the pilot appeared to be trying to shake the landing gear down.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying.

Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience\n\n-- Richard Branson (@richardbranson) December 29, 2014\n\nThe passengers' ordeal began four hours previously, when Flight VS43 left for Las Vegas at 11.44am with 447 passengers and 15 crew onboard. However, it hit problems before it reached the edge of UK airspace. The pilot had identified a problem with the landing gear, a technical issue that meant one of the five wheel sets would not descend. Instead of completing its transatlantic journey, the plane would, the captain announced, be turning back.\n\nThe vagaries of landing one of the world's biggest passenger jets meant that fuel had to be dumped en route, to bring it down to the target weight for a safe return. But the pilot was also attempting another part of what Virgin Atlantic termed a \"non-standard landing procedure\"- hoping the movement of the plane could shake down the landing gear where automation had failed. So began hours of circling around Gatwick and the South Downs, tracing a dense, bright green circle on flight tracking websites and alerting a small army of plane spotters.\n\nAt the airport, there came the relatively routine statement that emergency services were on standby \"purely as a precaution\". But passengers reported that the mood on the aircraft had changed when the announcement came that there would, after all, be an emergency landing, and that they would have to adopt the brace position. Crane said some passengers had cried.\n\nPassenger Mike Kaufman, speaking to Sky News from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing at just before 4pm had been \"textbook\". But, he admitted: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss, because it had been such a calm experience. It was probably less dramatic than watching it on the TV.\"\n\nHe said: \"The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.\"\n\nHe added: \"We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. That is off the menu now.\"\n\nA spokesman for the British pilots' trade union, Balpa, said: \"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"\n\nChief Superintendent Martin Walker of Sussex police said: \"Our co-ordinated partnership response is part of a well-rehearsed emergency procedure. We are delighted that the plane has landed safely and we will continue to support the operation where we're needed.\"",

                    "body": "Terrified passengers applauded a hero pilot after he landed a Virgin Atlantic jumbo jet safely at Gatwick airport after a major landing-gear fault.\n\nTravellers who had endured a nerve-racking few hours circling above the south coast after the problem was identified spoke of their relief as the pilot of Flight VS43 managed a \"textbook\" landing despite one of the plane's five sets of landing gear not deploying.\n\nPassengers, many heading for a New Year break in Las Vegas, adopted the brace position and emergency services were on standby as the giant aircraft, packed with 447 passengers and 15 crew, came into land.\n\nAnd there was spontaneous applause as the pilot pulled off the delicate landing without a hitch and the jet rolled safely to a stop.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nMr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nMike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been \"textbook\".\n\nInterviewed for Sky News, he went on: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem.\n\n\"The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.\"\n\nMr Kaufman told Sky News: \"Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now.\n\n\"We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nA spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: \"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"\n\nThe jet turned back soon after taking off late this morning and circled as its lost fuel ahead of what Virgin described as a \"a non-standard landing procedure\".\n\nDramatic photographs showed the jumbo jet landing with the right-side wing landing gear not deployed.\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said some passengers suffered minor injuries and runway was closed until at least 6pm.\n\nHe said: \"Virgin Atlantic flight VS043 has landed safely after returning to Gatwick due to a technical fault. Following the emergency landing, passengers have disembarked the aircraft via stairs. At this time, only minor injuries have been reported.\n\n\"The runway has been closed until the aircraft can be removed from the runway and, based on current predictions, it is not expected to reopen until at least 6pm.\n\n\"Currently no flights are departing Gatwick and inbound flights are being diverted to other airports. We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter.\"\n\nSussex Police Chief Superintendent Martin Walker said: \"Our co-ordinated partnership response is part of a well-rehearsed emergency procedure.\n\n\"We are delighted that the plane has landed safely and we will continue to support the operation where we're needed.\"",

                    "body": "A Virgin Atlantic plane carrying 447 passengers was forced to make an emergency landing at Gatwick after landing gear problems hit a US-bound flight.\n\nHundreds of holidaymakers applauded in relief after their pilot returned the Boeing 747 to base safely following an unconventional journey that included dumping fuel at sea and flying low over the Gatwick control tower twice so that air traffic controllers could scrutinise the main undercarriage with binoculars.\n\nA spokesman for Gatwick airport said that all the passengers had disembarked from the plane - originally headed to Las Vegas - and that \"some minor injuries\" had been reported.\n\nThe runway at Britain's second largest airport was closed for several hours, with incoming flights diverted to alternative airports and departing aircraft delayed as the drama affected the travel plans of thousands of passengers.\n\nSir Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic president, praised the crew of flight VS43. In a Twitter posting, he said: \"Well done VirginAtlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nEmergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft came into land.\n\nEyewitnesses reported that the jet was flying at a relatively low altitude, as the pilot appeared to be trying to shake the landing gear down.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and [we were] just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nFellow passenger Holly Jackson said the crew tried to \"deliberately bounce\" the plane to get the faulty landing gear back into position.\n\nShe told Sky News: \"They said this was a precautionary procedure, or something like that. But it didn't work and we were told we would have to get into the brace position for a landing and it was then that everybody did start to get scared.\"\n\nThe passengers' ordeal began four hours previously, when Flight VS43 left for Las Vegas at 11.44am with 447 passengers and 15 crew on board. However, it hit problems before it reached the edge of UK airspace. The pilot had identified a problem with the landing gear, a technical issue that meant one of the five wheel sets would not descend. Instead of completing its transatlantic journey, the plane would, the captain announced, be turning back.\n\nThe vagaries of landing one of the world's biggest passenger jets meant that fuel had to be dumped en route, to bring it down to the target weight for a safe return. But the pilot was also attempting another part of what Virgin Atlantic termed a \"non-standard landing procedure\" - hoping the movement of the plane could shake down the landing gear where automation had failed. So began hours of circling around Gatwick and the South Downs, tracing a dense, bright green circle on flight tracking websites and alerting a small army of planespotters.\n\nAt the airport there came the relatively routine statement that emergency services were on standby \"purely as a precaution\". But passengers reported that the mood on the aircraft had changed when the announcement came that there would, after all, be an emergency landing, and that they would have to adopt the brace position. Crane said some passengers had cried.\n\nPassenger Mike Kaufman, speaking to Sky News from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing at just before 4pm had been \"textbook\". But, he admitted: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss, because it had been such a calm experience. It was probably less dramatic than watching it on the TV.\"\n\nHe said: \"The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.\"\n\nHe added: \"We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. That is off the menu now.\"\n\nA spokesman for the British pilots' trade union, Balpa, said: \"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"\n\nChief Superintendent Martin Walker of Sussex police said: \"Our co-ordinated partnership response is part of a well-rehearsed emergency procedure. We are delighted that the plane has landed safely and we will continue to support the operation where we're needed.\"",

At this time, only minor injuries have been reported,\" a Gatwick spokesman said.\n\nVirgin Atlantic said the plane had been forced \"to implement a nonstandard landing procedure\" due to \"a technical issue with one of the landing gears.\"",

We're delighted that they have landed in Las Vegas in time for New Year's Eve.\"\n\nPassengers yesterday applauded with relief after their stricken Virgin Atlantic jumbo jet landed safely at the West Sussex airport and praised the aircraft's pilot.\n\nTravellers, who had had to get into the brace position, spoke of a \"textbook landing\" and praised the calmness of the cabin crew and the cockpit crew who had got the Las Vegas-bound plane down safely despite one of the aircraft's five sets of landing gear not deploying.\n\nSir Richard Branson added to the heartfelt thanks expressed by terrified passengers to the crew of the stricken Boeing 747.\n\nThe Virgin president said on Twitter: \"Well done VirginAtlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nA spokesman for Gatwick airport said that \"some minor injuries\" had been reported. Virgin Atlantic could not confirm that there had been any injuries.\n\nThe runway at Gatwick was closed until 7pm, with incoming flights diverted and departing ones delayed.\n\nThe 447 passengers were taken to the Hilton hotel at Gatwick Airport overnight before they took off again today.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane yesterday, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nThe jet turned back soon after taking off late yesterday morning and circled as it lost fuel ahead of what Virgin described as a \"a non-standard landing procedure\".\n\nDramatic photographs showed the jumbo jet landing with the right-side wing landing gear not deployed.\n\nTrevor Stirling, who was travelling to Las Vegas with his wife Catherine and four other friends to mark a number of 40th birthdays, said: \"The crew were almost chanting at us 'heads down, feet back' over and over throughout the landing.\n\n\"Once it was over everyone burst into spontaneous applause. There was just palpable relief.\"\n\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said last night that he understood this had been a \"very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family\".\n\nHe added: \"I would like to thank all of the Virgin Atlantic crew and colleagues, who responded with the absolute professionalism and care for our customers that we would expect.\"\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said it would take some time for normal service to resume and advised passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight.\n\nCaptain Brendan O'Neal, chairman of British pilots' organisation Balpa, said: \"These pilots have had to put into practise their years of training and experience to keep their aircraft and passengers safe.

The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.'\n\nMr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: 'They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.'\n\nMike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: 'This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.'\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been 'textbook'.\n\nInterviewed for Sky News, he went on: 'We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem.\n\n'The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.'\n\nMr Kaufman told Sky News: 'Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now.\n\n'We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.'\n\nA spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: 'Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.'\n\nDramatic photographs showed the jumbo jet landing with the right-side wing landing gear not deployed.\n\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said: 'I am very pleased to confirm that all customers and crew have now disembarked the VS43 flight to Las Vegas, which returned to Gatwick airport this afternoon following a problem with one of the landing gear.\n\n'I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans. We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.'\n\nHe went on: 'I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response. I understand that people have already been phoning our contact centre - from the plane - to make sure that they are booked on tomorrow's special flight to Las Vegas.\n\n'I want to reassure them that we'll make sure there's a seat for everyone and we really look forward to making sure they're in Vegas for an amazing New Year's Eve.",

The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nPraising the crew, the 24-year-old added: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nHe later posted photos from inside the stricken plane on his Twitter account, writing: \"Props to the pilot, not a clue how he landed that plane\".\n\nPassenger Hardeek Desai said he saw fuel being dumped out of the wing and revealed passengers were \"screaming and shouting\" as the plane touched down.\n\nHe said: \"The staff were trying to keep everyone calm but a few passengers were a bit panicky.\n\n\"One of the captain crew came out into the actual seating area to tell everyone that it was going to be OK.\n\n\"The staff were giving out drinks and water to make sure everyone was OK, but generally the mood was pretty good, until we hit the brace position.\n\n\"For my mind, personally, I was a bit worried, thinking what's going to happen? It doesn't really seem normal that fuel is coming out of the wing.\n\n\"I was slightly worried but just trying to keep calm and listen to what the staff were telling us. Around 30 seconds before we actually hit the ground, we were told to adopt the brace.\"\n\n\"At that stage it was literally just everyone shouting 'brace' and people just screaming and shouting,\" he continued. \"Everyone was a bit worried about what was going on.\n\n\"No one knew what was going on because we all had our heads down. As soon as they started to shout 'brace', everyone more or less panicked.\"\n\nPassenger Nick Hughes, 38, from Staffordshire, told the Mirror of his lucky escape from flight VS43.\n\nHe had to reassure worried partner Tracy Devlin, 48, when the crew revealed the plane had a serious problem.\n\nNick told the Mirror: \"The flights were a birthday present from Tracy who is a fairly nervous flier.\n\n\"I was trying to keep Tracy calm so I kept telling her everything was going to be okay.\n\n\"When the cabin crew announced we were going to land one or two people on the plane did get upset.\n\n\"I just looked out of the window at the view. There was a beautiful sunset and I was thinking 'Is this the last one I'm going to see?'\n\n\"The pilot was trying everything to open the landing gear correctly,\" Mr Hughes continued.\n\n\"He was tilting the plane from left to right, wing to wing. He also tried gaining altitude before suddenly dropping a few feet.\n\n\"The crew couldn't have done anything more. They were absolutely brilliant.\"\n\nFlight VS43 left Gatwick at 11.44am for Las Vegas' McCarran Airport but turned around before it had left British airspace after a landing gear warning lights went off.\n\nThe jumbo circled around the south coast and dumped fuel into the English Channel to minimise the risk of fire in a forced landing.\n\nDramatic photographs taken from the ground showed the right-side wing landing gear - one of four under the wings - had failed to deploy.\n\nPassenger Holly Jackson said the flight crew tried to \"deliberately bounce\" the plane to get the faulty landing gear back into position.\n\nShe said \"They said this was a precautionary procedure but it didn't work and we were told we would have to get into the brace position for a landing.\n\n\"It was then that everybody did start to get scared.\"\n\nAfter the landing passengers broke out into spontaneous applause for the hero pilot, named online only as 'David'.\n\nTwitter user @alexia_g88 posted: \"Biggest round of applause I've ever heard for a pilot landing. He's kept us informed the whole time of everything\".\n\n@JPDoy 100% the staff were amazing the whole way through. We've actually said thank you face to face -- Alexia (@alexia_g88)\n\nDecember 29, 2014\n\nPassengers were then taken off the plane 70 at a time to make sure it remained stable before being checked over by Hazardous Area Response paramedics.\n\nA spokesman for Gatwick Airport said several passengers suffered \"minor injuries\" in the landing but did not require hospital treatment.\n\nThe dramatic incident forced the closure of Gatwick's only runway, with dozens of flights diverted to other airports.\n\nVirgin boss Sir Richard Branson tweeted: \"Well done @virginatlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of #VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience\".\n\nWell done @virginatlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of #VS43.

The travellers, who had had to get into the brace position, spoke of a \"textbook landing\" and praised the calmness of the cabin crew and the cockpit crew, who had got the Las Vegas-bound plane down safely despite one of the aircraft's five sets of landing gear not deploying.\n\nSir Richard, the Virgin president, said on Twitter: \"Well done VirginAtlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nA spokesman for Gatwick airport said that all the passengers had disembarked from the plane and that \"some minor injuries\" had been reported. The runway at Gatwick was closed until at least 6pm with incoming flights diverted and departing ones delayed.\n\nEmergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft, with 447 passengers and 15 crew aboard, came in to land. Describing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Worcestershire, said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and we were just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nCrane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nMike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\"\n\nHe praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been \"textbook\".\n\nInterviewed for Sky News, he went on: \"We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem. The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm.\"\n\nA spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: \"Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.\"",

It stopped on the runway and was surrounded by fire-engines.\n\nPrior to landing it circled off the west coast, burning off fuel before heading back inland.\n\nThe plane also made two low level passes over Southampton airport which enabled officials to see the landing gear through binoculars.

About 13 of the passengers went on holiday as crew companions and obviously that original crew weren't travelling any more.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman said it was standard procedure for a new crew to operate a flight if there is an incident or delay.\n\nHundreds of passengers had applauded in relief after Williams returned their airliner to base safely on Monday following an unconventional journey that included dumping fuel at sea and flying low over the Gatwick control tower twice so that air traffic controllers could scrutinise the main undercarriage with binoculars.\n\nThe runway at Britain's second largest airport was closed for several hours, with incoming flights diverted to alternative airports and departing aircraft delayed as the drama affected the travel plans of thousands of passengers.\n\nRichard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic president, said on Twitter: \"Well done VirginAtlantic pilots & team for safe & skillful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nThe 447 passengers were taken to the Hilton hotel at Gatwick overnight before they took off again.\n\nDescribing the mood on the plane on Monday, one passenger said it was \"anxious, a lot were worried, some crying\".\n\nDan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, added: \"The mood was quiet and [we were] just waiting for the captain's next announcement.\"\n\nThe passengers' ordeal began four hours before the emergency landing, when Flight VS43 left for Las Vegas at 11.44am with 447 passengers and 15 crew on board. However, it hit problems before it reached the edge of UK airspace.\n\nWilliams identified a problem with the landing gear, a technical issue that meant one of the five wheel sets would not descend. Instead of completing its transatlantic journey, the plane would, he announced, be turning back.",

The airport's single runway is expected to be closed for at least two hours after a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 returned to the Sussex airport for a \"non-standard landing procedure\".\n\nThe Jumbo jet, flight number VS43, had taken off at 11.44am for the 5,200-mile flight to Las Vegas, with an estimated 450 passengers on board. It is believed that the flight crew became aware of a problem with the landing gear soon after take-off. The aircraft flew circuits over southern England while burning fuel to reduce its weight, and made two low-altitude passes over Gatwick for visual inspection of the undercarriage.\n\nThe aircraft landed safely shortly before 4pm, with emergency vehicles in attendance. Passengers disembarked via steps after about half-an-hour.\n\nNick Hughes, a passenger on the aircraft, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"They gave every opportunity for the landing gear to open, but unfortunately it never did.\n\n\"Initially they didn't reveal everything to the passengers. After we'd circled a few times you got the sense things weren't quite right.\n\n\"The actual landing was one of the softest landings I'd ever had. The crew were exemplary.\"\n\nThe airport tweeted: \"Virgin flight VS043 landed safely, the aircraft is being reviewed and passengers are disembarking. Check with your airline for flight delays.\"\n\nThe aircraft was being inspected on the ground before being towed away. The runway will also be checked for debris. A spokeswoman said it was unlikely to re-open until 6pm.\n\nGatwick is the busiest single-runway airport in the world, with up to 900 departures and arrivals per day. It is the busiest base for easyJet, Britain's biggest airline by passenger numbers. The airline told waiting passengers: \"Due to the emergency landing of a Virgin aircraft in London Gatwick this afternoon, the airport is currently closed. A number of our flights will be delayed as a result. Some of our flights that are airborne will divert to nearby airports and our customers will be taken to London Gatwick by coach.\"\n\nThe first flight to be diverted was a British Airways Airbus A320 from Algiers, which is currently on the ground at Bournemouth along with an aircraft from Nice. An arrival from Rome landed in Southampton. Other BA flights are being held at airports in Europe for the runway to be cleared.\n\nTen BA departures to and from Gatwick have so far been cancelled. Flights from Marrakech, Naples and Malaga are showing three-hour delays.\n\nThe first easyJet arrivals to be diverted were from Milan and Vienna. They are currently on the ground at Stansted. Other aircraft were diverted to Luton.\n\nA full complement of passengers are waiting at Las Vegas for the flight that they were expecting to take to be back in Britain tomorrow.\n\nWhile no cash compensation is due to passengers, because the event counts as an \"extraordinary circumstance\", the airlines have a duty of care to passengers - providing meals and, if necessary, overnight accommodation. Hotel rooms in the Gatwick area are likely to be in short supply tonight.\n\nIn November 1997, a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 made an emergency landing at Heathrow after a flight from Los Angeles when part of the undercarriage failed to deploy. Of the 114 passengers and crew on board, nine needed treatment for minor injuries sustained in the evacuation.",

It was very smooth.\"\n\nAlex Starkie, 25, from Bristol, said the pilot took the aircraft to 10,000ft and then dropped sharply in a bid to dislodge the trapped wheel.\n\n\"The pilot said there were guys with binoculars looking at the bottom of the plane, and then he started manoeuvres, going up and down to try and jolt it,\" he said.\n\n\"It was like a roller-coaster, going up to 10,000 feet and down to try to dislodge it. Obviously people were screaming a bit and getting upset.\"\n\nAnton Scoltock, 28, from Romford, Essex, said: \"There were lots of shouts and screams when we were going up and down.\"\n\nBen Coleman, 26, from Wickford, Essex, said some passengers were sick during the manoeuvres but praised the efforts of the crew.\n\n\"It was quite relaxed, to be honest\", he said.\n\nFlight VS43 took off from Gatwick at 11.44am - with most passengers planning to take in the New Year in Las Vegas - before turning back shortly after crossing over the north Devon coast.\n\nIt circled above the Bristol Channel before heading back to the south east where it remaining in a holding position to burn off fuel. It eventually landed at around 3.45pm.\n\nEmergency services rushed to the end of the runway where the plane could be seen heavily listing to one side.\n\nThe 447 passengers and 15 crew were eventually able to disembark an hour later, with Gatwick officials only reporting \"minor injuries\".\n\nThe airport reopened just after 7pm, with severe delays and cancellations caused to around 50 flights.\n\nIn a statement, Gatwick said: \"The airport is now facilitating inbound and outbound flights but it will take some time for normal service to resume... We are working with our airline partners to provide food, drink and welfare facilities for those passengers whose flights may either have been delayed or cancelled.\"\n\nThe pilot was named by passengers as \"Dave\" but Virgin refused to confirm his identity, insisting he would \"prefer not to be named\".\n\nIt was the second incident of its kind in the last two decades for Virgin Atlantic. In November 1997, Captain Tim Barnby won praise for safely landing an Airbus plane at Heathrow after a landing gear problem.\n\nThe plane, flying in from Los Angeles carrying 98 passengers and 16 crew, managed to touch down using three instead of four sets of landing gear.\n\nVirgin Atlantic said it was \"immensely proud of the professionalism shown by both the pilots and cabin crew of the VS43, as well as all of our teams on the ground\".\n\nSir Richard, the Virgin president, said on Twitter: \"Well done Virgin Atlantic pilots & team for safe & skilful landing of VS43. Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.\"\n\nOne passenger took to Twitter to say: \"Dave the pilot and crew where amazing. I had the privilege of sitting next to his daughter such a little gem.\"\n\nCaptain Brendan O'Neal, chairman of the British Airline Pilots Association, said: \"These pilots have had to put into practise their years of training and experience to keep their aircraft and passengers safe today. They did a very professional job in difficult circumstances.\n\n\"Pilots across the UK and across all airlines know that although incidents like this are rare, they could happen to any of us, and we have huge respect for the crews who fly with such skill and professionalism when it is needed.\"\n\nPassengers were transferred to a nearby Hilton hotel, with the airline promising to provide an alternative flight on Tuesday.\n\nCraig Kreeger, the airline's chief executive, said: \"I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans.\n\n\"We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\"\n\nBut some passengers already rejected the chance to travel again.\n\nNewly married Sarah and David Gillespie, 28, from Belfast said they were flying off for their honeymoon when it happened.\n\n\"I just thought, 'I'm not sure we are going to get out of this alive',\" said Sarah, 27. \"We got married last week and this was our honeymoon -spent at the Hilton at the airport. I was terrified and I'm a bit dubious about the flight tomorrow. \"",

Thoughts with passengers & crew, thanks for support & patience.'\n\nMeanwhile, Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger met with Mr Williams and the rest of the on board staff to thanks them for their heroics.\n\nThe drama unfolded yesterday after the flight took off from Gatwick airport.\n\nFor several hours, the jumbo jet had circled the airport and made several low-altitude passes so engineers could inspect the landing gear problem, leaving some passengers distraught.\n\nThe plane finally landed with only three quarters of its landing gear down after a set of wheels on the starboard wing refused to drop.\n\nThe person who filmed the drama inside the aircraft later wrote online 'took off from Gatwick and now back at Gatwick, the plane just made an emergency landing with 2 wheels, not a clue how he did it', before describing it as 'crazy'.\n\nToday, Jean Lightman, a close neighbour of Mr Williams, said the pilot was a very 'quiet and unassuming man' who would not want any fanfare about yesterday's incident.\n\nShe said: \"He would probably think he's just doing his job. He's a very private sort of guy. He's very unassuming.\n\n\"He always says hello when we see him out and about, he's a very nice man, a family man. I'm very pleased it all ended well, I would have expected him to be very calm and collected.\"\n\nShe said his children were all of school age.\n\nHer husband added: \"We'll have to crack open the bubbly now that we have a hero living next door.\"\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Mr Williams is a captain with Virgin Atlantic. It says he has previously worked for Monarch Airlines between 1994 and 1998.\n\nThe profile also states that he was educated at Shebbear College, a boarding school in north Devon.\n\nAfter the landing, terrified passengers - who had endured a nerve-racking few hours circling above the south coast after the problem was identified - spoke of their relief.\n\nPassengers are helped to disembark the Boeing 747.

They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.'\n\nMr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: \"They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.\"\n\nDavid Gillespie, 28, and new wife Sandra, from Belfast, were flying to Las Vegas for their honeymoon. Mrs Gillespie, 27, praised Mr Williams and his cabin crew for keeping everyone calm.\n\n\"I was terrified. I just thought 'I don't know if we are going to get out of this alive',\" she said. \"It was very scary. I'm so glad to be back, we're very relieved.\"\n\nPlumber Dean Turner and wife Stacy told how they sent texts with their final goodbyes to relatives as the cabin crew shouted 'brace, brace'. They'd planned the holiday as a treat for their daughter who just had major spinal surgery.\n\nMrs Turner, of Haverigg, Cumbria, said: \"We text our final goodbyes on the plane to family saying we didn't know if we would survive. Me and my husband just looked at each other and thought 'this is it.\" It was horrific.'\n\nThe family including Khenya, 16, Ellie, 13, and Maisie, four, had booked a holiday to New York for New Years, but when there were no hotel rooms available they swapped for the \u00a36,500 Las Vegas trip.\n\nMrs Turner said: \"Khenya had major surgery in the summer because she had scoliosis and had to have spinal fusion. This was supposed to be a treat for her.\n\n\"She has a heart defect and previously had open heart surgery and survived meningitis. And now with this too, we think we must have a guardian angel watching us. She's blessed.\"\n\nOf the landing she said: \"He went extremely fast from one side to the other four or five times and that freaked people out.\n\n\"The landing was smoother than others I've had. It was probably less dramatic on board than it was watching it on TV. It is going to go down as one of the greatest emergency landings in history.\n\n\"We knew he was going to do it but it was horrific. It didn't work so he told us he was going to put on full throttle and drop. It was like zero gravity. It was so quick. It was like being on the world's worst roller coaster.\n\n\"People were being sick and people had nosebleeds. There were a lot of scared people. Ellie thought she was going to die. She was screaming on the plane.\n\n\"The shaking didn't work so the pilot said he was going to have to burn fuel by flying round and round to make the plane lighter.\n\n\"He then told us we were going to do an emergency landing.\n\n\"At this point we were terrified. We had to get into the bracing position and the plane went deadly silent. They shouted 'brace, brace' brace' and then 'head down, feet back' over and over again.\n\n\"But when we landed it was really smooth, just like any other flight and everybody cheered. The cabin crew and pilot were brilliant. I couldn't fault them.\n\n\"They had clean clothes and dinner waiting for us. They offered us another plane but we were all traumatised. They've offered counselling and a course to help us get over our fear of flying now. If we get on a plane again it will have to be a very short flight.\n\n'We've watched things like this on the news but we never thought it would happen to us. My dad was tracking the plane and friends were watching the news.\n\n'Maisie slept through most of it. She had no idea what was going on when I told her to put her head down. Then when we got off the plane she said to me 'is this Las Vegas?''\n\nThis morning, passengers from yesterday's grounded flight who wished to continue their journey flew out from Gatwick on a specially-arranged flight at 11am, a Virgin spokesman said.\n\nJust 415 of the original 447 passengers chose to fly today.\n\nA Gatwick airport spokesman said there had been seven flight cancellations so far today as a knock-on effect of yesterday's incident and that there was an average 20-minute delay across flights.\n\nHe said most services were operating as normal, but he advised passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight before travelling. .",

Photographs showed the jumbo jet with the right-side wing landing gear - one of five - not deployed, despite frantic attempts to release the mechanism.\n\nAll passengers were forced to adopt the brace position, but escaped from the \"non-standard landing\" at around 3.45pm with only minor injuries, but with some said to be in tears.\n\nThe incident caused chaos at the single-runway airport - Britain's second busiest - as the heavily listing plane remained on the tarmac for more than three hours.\n\nAll incoming flights were diverted to airports including Stansted, Luton, Southend, Cardiff and Bournemouth.\n\nAround 50 departures were delayed or cancelled until the runway reopened at 7pm - disrupting the travel plans of thousands.\n\nVirgin has offered passengers another flight today - but not everyone will be taking it.\n\nNewly-married Sarah and David Gillespie, 28, from Belfast were flying off for their honeymoon when it happened.\n\n\"I just thought, 'I'm not sure we are going to get out of this alive',\" said Sarah, 27. \"I was terrified and I'm a bit dubious about the (replacement) flight.\"\n\nYesterday evening, Virgin chief Richard Branson praised the crew for masterminding a \"safe and skilful landing\".\n\nIt was reported that the pilot - who was not officially named by the airline - had his own daughter on board at the time.\n\nOne passenger, Mike Kaufman, described the landing as \"textbook\", adding: \"This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.\" Alex Starkie (25), from Bristol, said the pilot took the aircraft to 10,000ft and then dropped sharply in a bid to dislodge the trapped wheel.\n\n\"The pilot said there were guys with binoculars looking at the bottom of the plane, and then he started manoeuvres, going up and down to try and jolt it,\" he said.\n\n\"It was like a roller-coaster, going up to 10,000 feet and down to try to dislodge it. Obviously, people were screaming a bit and getting upset.\"\n\nAnton Scoltock (28), from Essex, said: \"There were lots of shouts and screams when we were going up and down.\"\n\nBen Coleman (26), from Wickford, Essex, said some passengers were sick during the manoeuvres but praised the efforts of the crew.\n\n\"It was quite relaxed, to be honest\", he said.\n\nFlight VS43 took off from Gatwick at 11.44am before turning back shortly after crossing over the north Devon coast.\n\nIt circled above the Bristol Channel before heading back to the south east where it remaining in a holding position to burn off fuel. It eventually landed at around 3.45pm.\n\nEmergency services rushed to the runway where the plane was heavily listing to one side.

Me and my husband just looked at each other and thought \"this is it\". It was horrific.'\n\nThe family had initially planned to go to New York to bring in the New Year but when they discovered there were no hotel rooms in the city available, they decided to switch their trip to Las Vegas instead, paying \u00a36,500.\n\nMrs Turner said: 'Khenya had major surgery in the summer because she had scoliosis and had to have spinal fusion. This was supposed to be a treat for her.\n\n'She has a heart defect and previously had open heart surgery and survived meningitis. And now with this too, we think we must have a guardian angel watching us. She's blessed.\n\n'We weren't even supposed to be on that flight because we had originally booked to go to New York but had a refund when there were no hotel rooms left.'\n\nAdministrator Mrs Turner and her husband said the holiday had been 'doomed' from the start after a nearly 10 hour drive from Haverigg to Gatwick to arrive at a hotel which had no gas.\n\nThen an hour into the 11.30am flight yesterday, the pilot announced they would have to turn back to Gatwick.\n\nShe said: 'About 10 minutes later the pilot said we were going to have to dump some fuel. We spent about an hour pouring fuel off the wings. It was horrific. We didn't know the extent of the problem.\n\n'They said we would be landing at 1.15pm but it came and went.\n\n'We started to think something's not right. They started to take pictures under the plane while we were in the air so they could see what the problem was and then they said one of the wheels was stuck.\n\n'The pilot said they were going to shake the plane to get the wheel down. It was the worst feeling you can imagine.\n\n'He went extremely fast from one side to the other four or five times and that freaked people out.\n\n'We knew he was going to do it but it was horrific. It didn't work so he told us he was going to put on full throttle and drop. It was like zero gravity. It was so quick. It was like being on the world's worst roller coaster.\n\n'People were being sick and people had nosebleeds. There were a lot of scared people. Ellie thought she was going to die. She was screaming on the plane.\n\n'The shaking didn't work so the pilot said he was going to have to burn fuel by flying round and round to make the plane lighter.\n\n'We had been on there for quite a long time by this point and people were desperate for the toilet so he levelled it out and the queue was all the way down the aisle.\n\n'He then told us we were going to do an emergency landing.\n\n'At this point we were terrified. We had to get into the bracing position and the plane went deadly silent.\n\n'They shouted \"brace, brace, brace\" and then \"head down, feet back\" over and over again.\n\n'They thought we were going to go off the runway because the wheel hadn't come down so it was harder for them to break.\n\n'But when we landed it was really smooth, just like any other flight and everybody cheered.\n\n'The cabin crew and pilot were brilliant. I couldn't fault them.'\n\nThe family have since been given a complete refund for the flight and were last night put up in the Hilton hotel.\n\nMrs Turner explained: 'They had clean clothes and dinner waiting for us. They offered us another plane but we were all traumatised.\n\n'They've offered counselling and a course to help us get over our fear of flying now. If we get on a plane again it will have to be a very short flight.\n\n'We've watched things like this on the news but we never thought it would happen to us. My dad was tracking the plane and friends were watching the news.\n\n'Maisie slept through most of it. She had no idea what was going on when I told her to put her head down. Then when we got off the plane she said to me \"is this Las Vegas?\"'\n\nToday the hero pilot who safely landed the stricken Virgin plane was revealed to be 47-year-old senior pilot David Williams.\n\nThe father-of-three, who has more than 20 years' flying experience, remained modest about his heroics - but admitted the incident had been 'out of the ordinary'.\n\nIn a brief statement, he said: 'All of our pilots at Virgin Atlantic are trained to the highest standards and we go through regular testing to deal with any scenario that may arise.\n\n'Clearly this was an out of the ordinary landing but I was just doing my job and any one of our pilots would have taken the same actions.'\n\nHe added: 'I'm really proud of my colleagues on the ground and in the air and the support they gave me during this event - everyone worked really hard in a difficult situation and we are delighted that our customers were able to travel to Las Vegas the next day for their New Year's Eve celebrations.",

Such a landing does carry a small risk - there is likely to be extensive damage to the aircraft; it could conceivably catch fire or flip over if it lands too hard. Bad weather or high winds can increase the danger.\n\nHowever, such landings are normally safe if performed correctly, as numerous case studies show. In 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 016 made a belly landing in Warsaw after its landing gear failed - there were no injuries reported. Similarly, Mal\u00e9v Flight 262 from Budapest to Thessaloniki had to make a gear-up landing on July 4, 2000, but there were no casualties.\n\nPatrick Smith, a US pilot, examines the issue in his book Cockpit Confidential, with reference to a jetBlue flight which was forced to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles in 2005 when its landing gear failed to retract properly after take-off.\n\n\"Although only a minor incident from a technical point of view, the entire affair was caught on live television, engrossing millions of Americans and needlessly scaring the living daylights out of everybody on the plane,\" he explains.\n\n\"Moments after liftoff from Burbank, California, the pilots realised their forward landing gear had not properly retracted and was cocked at 90 degrees. Unable to realign it, they would have to make an emergency landing with the tyres twisted sideways. The pilots and jetBlue's dispatch team agreed to a diversion to Los Angeles, primarily to take advantage of LAX's long runways. But first came the matter of the plane's gross weight, which was several thousand pounds above its maximum allowable heft for touchdown.\n\n\"The A320, like other smaller jetliners, does not have a fuel dump capacity. This meant three hours of leisure flying over the Pacific until the poundage was down to the appropriate amount. Those three hours are what allowed this relative nonevent to be catapulted into a full-on spectacle.\n\n\"The California news outlets, out and about in search of the usual car chases and traffic accidents, had only to tip their cameras upwards to catch the Airbus as it circled. On board, 146 souls readied for what, according to the commentators, could very well be a devastating crash. Those of us who knew better... saw a jetliner preparing for what would be a telegenic but perfectly manageable landing. And that's what we got.\"\n\nGear-up landings are suprisingly common, and are not always made due to mechanical error. Often a pilot will simply forget to lower it - indeed, America's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported 96 unintentional gear-up landings in 2003 alone.",

Richard and his fellow passengers were asked to hold tight while the pilot took the Boeing 747 went through some emergency manoeuvres to try to dislodge the landing gear.\n\n\"It was like the best rollercoaster you have ever been on, and it would have been fun if it wasn't so serious,\" said Richard.\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly say we dived, but we ascended and descended then did some rolling moved from left to right. People were starting to get a little concerned.\n\n\"I was in first class. Towards the back there were a lot of kids and a lot of holidaymakers who might not fly very often. You could hear that a few were sobbing.\"\n\nOnce it became clear the plane would have to make an emergency landing at Gatwick, it was just a matter of waiting for the final descent, when passengers were asked to adopt the brace position.\n\n\"The cabin crew were as cool as ice cubes,\" said Richard. \"They were reassuring people that this was what they were trained to do. The captain gave us his word that everyone was going to get off the plane safely and be okay.\n\n\"All I could think of was my family. I sent them a text. By then I believe my girlfriend was already aware of what was going on. It was an ordeal.\"\n\nPilot David Williams made what Richard called \"one of the best landings I have had in a while,\" but the danger was not over.\n\nHe said: \"The scariest part was the cabin crew screaming to stay in position. The aircraft was listing to the right and it would have been quite serious if it had collapsed.\n\n\"It was like a scene from the Italian Job. Everyone on the right side of the plane had to move gingerly to the left and make their way to the door.\"\n\nThankfully everyone got off the plane safely. Most then flew to Las Vegas the next day.\n\nSpeaking from his hotel room in Vegas on Wednesday, Richard said: \"Thoughts of family are what come into your mind at times like that.

He is definitely a cool and calm individual.\n\n\"He is quite a quiet and unassuming man, he would not want a big fuss.\"\n\nFriend Simon Bates said he was a \"typical pilot, calm and considered\".\n\nFrancis Jennings, who is married to Mr Williams' sister-in-law, said the hero pilot just wanted to be left in peace.\n\nAll the passengers aboard the Virgin jet praised Mr Williams for keeping them calm and making the \"textbook\" landing as smooth as possible.\n\nVirgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger met with the pilot and the rest of the on board staff to thanks them for their heroics.\n\nSir Richard Branson hailed the crew for masterminding a \"safe and skilful landing\".\n\nA former pupil of Shebbear College in Devon, he has flying experience going back at least 20 years.\n\nHe is listed on his Linkedin page as a Captain of 747-400 for Virgin Atlantic and previously flew for Monarch Airlines between 1994 and 1998.\n\nA keen cyclist Mr Williams has raised more than \u00a33,000 for charities, including the University of Liverpool Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund and the Down's Syndrome Association.\n\nSponsored bike rides included from Lands End to John O'Groats and from Boston to New York.",

You do not need your life jacket, we're landing on land. Leave your life jacket where it is.\"\n\n\"When you hear the command 'brace, brace' you must adopt a brace position shown on your safety card. You must stay in the brace position until the aircraft stops completely.\"\n\nHe repeats the last sentence before saying that the captain may order the passengers to quickly leave the aircraft by saying \"this is an evacuation, evacuate, evacuate, evacuate.\"\n\nAnother flight attendant demonstrates the brace position after pointing out the exits on the plane. She places her hands over her head while some other passengers follow her lead.\n\nNick Hughes, a passenger on the aircraft, had told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"The actual landing was one of the softest landings I'd ever had. The crew were exemplary.\"\n\nPassengers on board the flight have been expecting to leave on another aircraft at 11am today to get to the west coast of the US in time to see in the New Year.\n\nArriving easyJet flights were diverted to Southend and Bristol airports and 34 departures made by the airline were cancelled from Gatwick due to the Virgin Atlantic plane.\n\nBritish Airways inbound flights were also diverted to Bournemouth and Southampton.

Me and my husband just looked at each other and thought 'this is it'. It was horrific.\"\n\nThe family including Khenya(correct), 16, Ellie, 13, and Maisie, four, had booked a holiday to New York for New Years, but when there were no hotel rooms available they swapped for the \u00a36,500 Las Vegas trip.\n\nMrs Turner said: \"Khenya(correct)had major surgery in the summer because she had scoliosis and had to have spinal fusion. This was supposed to be a treat for her.\n\n\"She has a heart defect and previously had open heart surgery and survived meningitus. And now with this too, we think we must have a guardian angel watching us. She's blessed.\n\n\"We weren't even supposed to be on that flight because we had originally booked to go to New York but had a refund when there were no hotel rooms left.\"\n\nAdministrator Mrs Turner and her husband said the holiday had been \"doomed\" from the start after a nearly 10 hour drive from Haverigg to Gatwick to arrive at a hotel which had no gas.\n\nShe added: \"We feel like the holiday was doomed from the start.\"\n\nAn hour into the 11.30am flight the pilot announced they would have to turn back to Gatwick.\n\nShe said: \" Then about 10 minutes later the pilot said we were going to have to dump some fuel. We spent about an hour pouring fuel off the wings. It was horrific. We didn't know the extent of the problem.\n\n\"They said we would be landing at 1.15pm but it came and went.\n\n\"We started to think something's not right. They started to take pictures under the plane while we were in the air so they could see what the problem was and then they said one of the wheels was stuck. The pilot said they were going to shake the plane to get the wheel down. It was the worst feeling you can imagine.\n\n\"He went extremely fast from one side to the other four or five times and that freaked people out.\n\n\"We knew he was going to do it but it was horrific. It didn't work so he told us he was going to put on full throttle and drop. It was like zero gravity. It was so quick. It was like being on the world's worst roller coaster.\n\n\"People were being sick and people had nosebleeds. There were a lot of scared people. Ellie thought she was going to die. She was screaming on the plane.\n\n\"The shaking didn't work so the pilot said he was going to have to burn fuel by flying round and round to make the plane lighter.\n\n\"We had been on there for quite a long time by this point and people were desperate for the toilet so he levelled it out and the queue was all the way down the aisle.\n\n\"He then told us we were going to do an emergency landing.\n\n\"At this point we were terrified. We had to get into the bracing position and the plane went deadly silent. They shouted 'brace, brace' brace' and then 'head down, feet back' over and over again. They thought we were going to go off the runway because the wheel hadn't come down so it was harder for them to break. But when we landed it was really smooth, just like any other flight and everybody cheered. The cabin crew and pilot were brilliant. I couldn't fault them. We've been given a complete refund since and they have put us up in the Hilton.\n\n\"They had clean clothes and dinner waiting for us. They offered us another plane but we were all traumatised. They've offered counselling and a course to help us get over our fear of flying now. If we get on a plane again it will have to be a very short flight.\n\n\"We've watched things like this on the news but we never thought it would happen to us. My dad was tracking the plane and friends were watching the news.\n\n\"Maisie slept through most of it. She had no idea what was going on when I told her to put her head down. Then when we got off the plane she said to me 'is this Las Vegas?'\"\n\nCraig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic said: \"I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans. We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.\"",

The incident, which was experienced by 447 passengers and 15 crew members, is just one of many cases in recent memory where a possible aviation catastrophe was avoided and all those on board survived the plane's landing.\n\nLion Air Boeing 737: April 2013, Bali, Indonesia\n\nAll 108 people on board the Lion Air Flight 904 escaped without serious injury when the Boeing 737 they were travelling on crashed into the sea off the coast of Bali, having missed the runway at the island's Denpasar airport. \"Everybody screamed and water suddenly surged into the plane. Passengers panicked and scrambled for life jackets. Some passengers fell, some ran into others, it was chaos,\" one of the survivors, Ignatius Juan Sinduk, told AFP. \"I managed to grab [a lifejacket] and slowly swam out of the plane and to the shore.\" An inquiry determined that the flight crew lost their bearings after entering a raincloud on descent.\n\nCaribbean Airlines Boeing 737-800: July 2011, Timehri, Guyana\n\nA Caribbean Airlines flight from New York broke in half when it crash landed in Guyana, having overshot the runway by 1,700 feet at Cheddi Jagan International Airport, 41 kilometers from the capital, Georgetown. One passenger suffered leg injuries in the accident, and 100 needed medical treatment after the crash, which was survived by the 163 people on board. \"Everything started caving in and the girl next to me just sat there motionless in shock,' passenger Betsy Myndyllo told the Daily Mail, while another said: \"It was terror. I was praying to Jesus.\"\n\nAlrosa Tupolov Tu-154: September 2010, Komi, Russia\n\nThe domestic Russian Alrosa Mirny Enterprise Flight 514 from Udachny to Moscow suffered a complete failure of electric power when flying at 10,600 meters, resulting in the loss of its navigational systems and fuel pumps. As a consequence the plane, carrying 72 passengers and 9 crew, was left with just 30 minutes of flying time before the fuel ran out. The pilots managed to land the plane in a disused airfield close to the village of Ihzma, in northern Russia. \"It's a miracle that we were able to land on the strip, we only had another ten minutes of fuel when we came across it and we are very thankful,\" the pilots told a correspondent for the local BNK News.

En el texto reconoce que, al principio, \"ten\u00eda dudas sobre si era prudente proceder con el desarrollo de un nuevo SpaceShipTwo\", pero en \u00faltima instancia, \u00e9l y la compa\u00f1\u00eda decidieron seguir adelante.\n\n\"Mientras viajaba desde mi casa a Mojave -donde se produjo el siniestro- me vi cuestion\u00e1ndome seriamente por primera vez si deber\u00eda continuar apoyando el desarrollo de algo que puede acabar en circunstancias tan tr\u00e1gicas\", ha escrito Branson.\n\nLa respuesta, dice, se la dieron \"de inmediato\" los dise\u00f1adores, los constructores, los ingenieros, los pilotos y toda la comunidad que trabaja para Virgin Galactic y que \"creen apasionadamente que hay que abrir el espacio y hacerlo accesible\".\n\nLa nave SpaceShipTwo de Virgin Galactic est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ada para transportar ocho personas (dos pilotos y seis pasajeros) en ida y vuelta al espacio suborbital. Cada asiento cuesta 200.000 euros y ya existe una lista de cientos de personas que han solicitado el servicio.\n\nEl pasado 31 de octubre se produjo un accidente durante una prueba de vuelo de la SpaceShipTwo, que provoc\u00f3 la muerte del copiloto Michael Alsbury e hiri\u00f3 gravemente al piloto Peter Siebold despu\u00e9s de que el veh\u00edculo se rompiera y se estrellara durante el vuelo. La National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) abri\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n sobre el accidente que ha durado varios meses.\n\nEn noviembre, los funcionarios de la NTSB informaron que el exclusivo sistema de \"flecos\" de SpaceShipTwo en su cola, que est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado para ser utilizado durante la reentrada a la Tierra, se hab\u00eda desplegado antes de tiempo durante el vuelo. Al parecer fue Alsbury quien lo hizo de manera manual.\n\nTras este suceso fueron varios los clientes que han solicitado la cancelaci\u00f3n del viaje y el reembolso de sus 200.000 euros, entre ellos la princesa Beatriz de Inglaterra, seg\u00fan informa Space.com. Sin embargo, Branson ha explicado que \"una gran mayor\u00eda\" ha mostrado su apoyo a la compa\u00f1\u00eda en los d\u00edas posteriores al accidente y han decidido mantener su billete.\n\nParece que Virgin Galactic tendr\u00e1 que volver a retrasar la fecha de su primer vuelo espacial comercial. En un primer momento se cre\u00eda que ser\u00eda en 2014, pero finalmente, Branson apunt\u00f3 que la fecha estar\u00eda m\u00e1s cerca de 2015. Ahora, la compa\u00f1\u00eda est\u00e1 construyendo un segundo veh\u00edculo SpaceShipTwo, que tendr\u00e1 que pasar por las pruebas de vuelo hasta que se le d\u00e9 su visto bueno, as\u00ed que habr\u00e1 que seguir esperando para conocer el estreno de este proyecto.",
