                    "body": "(CNN) -- On September 18, Scots go to the polls to vote on the future of their country.\n\nIt's a vote that could end Scotland's 307-year union with England and Wales as Great Britain -- and see it launch into the world as an independent nation of some 5.3 million people.\n\nWhen campaigning began, that seemed a far-fetched prospect. But the most recent polls suggest that what many Britons consider unthinkable could happen -- and the United Kingdom as we know it could be torn asunder.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the landmark referendum.\n\nWhat are the Scottish voting on, and why?\n\nVoters will be presented with a simple yes/no question: Should Scotland be an independent country?\n\nThe Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, says this is a \"once in a generation opportunity\" for Scotland's people to take control of the decisions that affect them most. A \"yes\" vote means that \"Scotland's future will be in Scotland's hands,\" it says, and that life will be better and fairer for its people.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron wants Scotland to remain part of an undivided United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He says that it is a decision solely for the Scottish people -- but that remaining part of the United Kingdom will give them security and strength. \"There will be no going back,\" he warns.\n\nBecause the United Kingdom has no written constitution, there's no established law to govern the process. So these are truly uncharted waters.\n\nWhy is this significant to the rest of the world?\n\nThe question mark over Scotland's future is already having an impact on domestic and international business. Some worry that the break-up of the United Kingdom could undermine London's standing as an international financial capital.\n\nLast month, 130 business leaders published an open letter in which they warned of the impact of uncertainty over issues including currency, regulation, tax, pensions, EU membership and support for Scottish exports. A day later, more than 200 other business leaders signed an open letter backing an independent Scotland.\n\nThe British pound sank Monday after the first poll to put the \"yes\" vote in the lead, with CNN Money reporting that it reflected uncertainty over the outcome of the referendum and an increased risk of a \"messy divorce.\"\n\nThe UK's defense capability could be affected. The Scottish government says it wants to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland as soon as possible -- namely, the UK Trident nuclear submarine fleet based at Faslane. The Scottish government says, \"It is our firm position that an independent Scotland should not host nuclear weapons and we would only join NATO on that basis.\"\n\nScotland would have to renegotiate its entry to both NATO and the European Union if it votes for independence. EU leaders have signaled they would take a hard line and make Scotland apply to join like any other independent nation. However, the \"yes\" campaign says it could easily be done through amendments to existing treaties.\n\nIf Scotland chooses to split off from Britain, it could give other people ideas.\n\nThe debate is being closely watched by independence movements in Spain's Catalonia province, Canada's Quebec province and France's Mediterranean island of Corsica.\n\nIf Scotland votes to leave, British Prime Minister David Cameron will likely come under pressure to resign -- although he has told UK media \"emphatically\" he will not do. The major Westminster parties have promised to devolve more powers to Scotland if it chooses to stay in the union.\n\nWho can vote?\n\nThanks to a bill passed last year extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, essentially everyone living in Scotland who is 16 or older on the day of the referendum will be able to vote.\n\nThis means English or Welsh citizens who reside in Scotland can take part. But Scots who are living elsewhere in the United Kingdom or overseas will not be entitled to cast a ballot.\n\nIt also means that the residents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland get no say on a historic change to the makeup of the United Kingdom.\n\nWhat's the history behind the vote?\n\nScotland has long had a testy relationship with its more populous neighbor. The Act of Union in 1707 joined the kingdom of Scotland with England and Wales, but many Scots were unhappy at being yoked to their longtime rival south of the border.\n\nSince 1999, Scotland has had devolved government, meaning many, but not all, decisions are made at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh. In May 2011 the nationalist Scottish National Party, which had campaigned on a promise to hold an independence referendum, surprised many by winning an outright majority in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nIn October 2012, the UK and Scottish governments agreed that the referendum would be held, and the question to be put to voters was agreed on early last year.\n\nDauvit Broun, a professor of Scottish history at the University of Glasgow, said one driving force for the vote was the widening gulf between the policies pursued by the coalition UK government in Westminster, led by the Conservative Party under Cameron since 2010, and what the Scottish people want.\n\nMany Scots are strongly opposed to the current Westminster government's attempts to reform -- or in their eyes dismantle -- the welfare state and say it was not elected by them. Illustrating that sentiment, there's only one Conservative MP in Scotland at present, leading humorists to point out that even giant pandas are better represented (Edinburgh Zoo has two.)\n\n\"Since the period of Margaret Thatcher, there has been a growing divide, and a sense that what Scotland feels consensus about ... has become more and more different to England,\" Broun said.\n\nLooking further back, Scotland and England have been growing apart since the demise of the British Empire, Broun says. The decline of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, which provided a sense of self-government and Scottish identity, has also played a part in fueling the desire for independence, he said.\n\nWho are the main players?\n\nScotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is the ebullient leader of the pro-independence campaign. Labour MP Alistair Darling, who represents an Edinburgh constituency, heads the pro-union Better Together campaign.\n\nThe pair have taken part in two TV debates, with Darling widely judged to have come out on top in the first, by a narrow margin, and Salmond to have done significantly better in the second.\n\nDavid Cameron has also spoken strongly in favor of Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt's not just UK politicians who are getting involved. Singer David Bowie, in a Brit Awards acceptance speech delivered by supermodel Kate Moss, pleaded, \"Scotland, stay with us.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United football club manager Alex Ferguson also opposes a split and has backed the \"Better Together\" campaign. \"800,000 Scots, like me, live and work in other parts of the United Kingdom. We don't live in a foreign country; we are just in another part of the family of the UK,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nHarry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who lives in Scotland, made a hefty donation to the Better Together campaign, and Beatles star Paul McCartney has signed a letter urging Scottish voters to stick with Britain.\n\nThe Yes campaign has its own celebrity backers -- including former James Bond star Sean Connery, actor Brian Cox, and comedian Frankie Boyle.\n\nActor Alan Cumming launched the Twitter campaign #goforitscotland. \"What's happening now in Scotland is the most exciting political and social discourse that will forever change our destiny. Check it out!\" he tweeted as the vote nears.\n\nEven U.S President Barack Obama has got in on the act. He acknowledged it was a decision for the people of Scotland, but added: \"We obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies we will ever have remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner.\"\n\nWhat are the key issues?\n\nQuestions over the economy have dominated the debate.\n\nThe Scottish government argues the country would be better off after independence, largely based on its taking control of revenues from North Sea oil and gas found in Scottish waters. It says it would manage the energy industry better, invest to boost production, and create a wealth fund, similar to Norway's oil fund, to benefit future generations.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the Scottish government's rosy assessment. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in March said the latest figures showed Scotland's budget deficit had worsened relative to the rest of the United Kingdom, thanks to falling North Sea revenues and higher public spending north of the border. It also warned of the dangers of relying too heavily on a volatile and ultimately finite income source.\n\nThe Scottish government says the economy is diverse, with other key elements including food and drink, tourism, creative industries, universities, financial services and manufacturing.\n\nAnother big issue is what currency an independent Scotland would have.\n\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond has said he wants Scotland to continue to use the pound in a currency union with the rest of the United Kingdom, and that it has the right to do so.\n\nBut the three main parties in Westminster -- David Cameron's Conservatives, their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats, and Labour -- have all said this won't be an option. The Scottish government responded that this was \"bullying\" from Westminster.\n\nIt's unclear what would happen to Scotland's share of UK debt if it's not part of a currency union.\n\nWhat's the mood?\n\nA series of opinion polls in past months has given the pro-union camp a lead. However, the most recent polls have shown that shrinking or disappearing altogether.\n\nA YouGov poll conducted for The Sunday Times and released on September 7 showed the \"yes\" vote at 51% and \"no\" at 49%. The poll of 1,084 voters excluded undecided voters and YouGov, a well respected UK polling organization, said the numbers represented \"a statistical dead heat.\"\n\nYouGov President Peter Kellner said a 2-point gap was too small to predict the outcome of the referendum but demonstrated that support for the \"Better Together\" campaign had fallen \"at an astonishing rate.\" Four weeks ago, YouGov put \"no\" at 58% and \"yes\" at 42%, Kellner said.\n\nOf course, it's just one poll among many.\n\nA Panelbase poll commissioned by Yes Scotland and also released September 7 suggested that 48% of voters supported independence -- excluding undecideds -- while 52% wanted to remain united.\n\nThe latest poll of polls by ScotCen, an independent research center, shows the \"no\" camp hanging onto a narrow lead over the \"yes\" camp, but the gap continues to close. That slight tightening of the race reflects a new TNS poll out Tuesday showing the \"no\" vote at 39%, \"yes\" at 38% and undecided at 18%.\n\nMany in the Yes campaign feel they have a momentum of support that will build toward the September 18 vote.\n\nBut the No campaigners are confident they represent the silent majority who, after considering all the factors involved, will decide against independence.\n\nWhat would happen if Scotland votes Yes?\n\nShould Scots defy Westminster's expectation and vote \"yes,\" there will be a flurry of activity to ensure everything is in place for Salmond's projected independence date of 24 March, 2016.\n\nUpon confirmation of a victory, the Yes Scotland leader will put together his \"Team Scotland\" negotiating team. It is expected to include his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, alongside a broad, cross-party group.\n\nCameron -- if he hasn't been forced to resign after presiding over the breakup of the UK's 300-year-old union -- will need to form his own negotiating side.\n\nChief among the matters up for negotiation are the currency union and Scotland's share of the UK's national debt, the relocation of the Trident fleet and even potential border controls. The \"yes\" campaign has said it intends Scotland to remain part of the Common Travel Area, which allows free movement for citizens of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.\n\nCameron will have to move quickly to avoid financial instability by giving a definitive answer to the currency question, and there has been suggestion that the next UK general election -- scheduled for May 2015 -- might be postponed until after Scotland has exited the union.\n\nThe Scottish government would have to set in motion a process to produce a written constitution. Queen Elizabeth II would remain head of state.\n\nAn independent Scotland would also have to negotiate paths to membership for both NATO and the European Union, two international organizations that the \"yes\" campaign says are in Scotland's future, but may be difficult to re-enter as a new nation.\n\nCNN's Euan McKirdy, Susannah Cullinane and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.",

Illustrating that sentiment, there's only one Conservative MP in Scotland at present, leading humorists to point out that even giant pandas are better represented (Edinburgh Zoo has two.)\n\n\"Since the period of Margaret Thatcher, there has been a growing divide, and a sense that what Scotland feels consensus about ... has become more and more different to England,\" Broun said.\n\nLooking further back, Scotland and England have been growing apart since the demise of the British Empire, Broun says. The decline of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, which provided a sense of self-government and Scottish identity, has also played a part in fueling the desire for independence, he said.\n\nWho are the main players?\n\nScotland's First Minister Alex Salmond is the ebullient leader of the pro-independence campaign. Labour MP Alistair Darling, who represents an Edinburgh constituency, heads the pro-union Better Together campaign.\n\nThe pair have taken part in two TV debates, with Darling widely judged to have come out on top in the first, by a narrow margin, and Salmond to have done significantly better in the second.\n\nDavid Cameron has also spoken strongly in favor of Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt's not just UK politicians who are getting involved. Singer David Bowie, in a Brit Awards acceptance speech delivered by supermodel Kate Moss, pleaded, \"Scotland, stay with us.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United football club manager Alex Ferguson also opposes a split and has backed the \"Better Together\" campaign. \"800,000 Scots, like me, live and work in other parts of the United Kingdom. We don't live in a foreign country; we are just in another part of the family of the UK,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\nHarry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who lives in Scotland, made a hefty donation to the Better Together campaign, and Beatles star Paul McCartney has signed a letter urging Scottish voters to stick with Britain.\n\nThe Yes campaign has its own celebrity backers -- including former James Bond star Sean Connery, actor Brian Cox, and comedian Frankie Boyle.\n\nActor Alan Cumming launched the Twitter campaign #goforitscotland. \"What's happening now in Scotland is the most exciting political and social discourse that will forever change our destiny. Check it out!\" he tweeted as the vote nears.\n\nEven U.S President Barack Obama has gotten in on the act. He acknowledged it was a decision for the people of Scotland, but added: \"We obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies we will ever have remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner.\"\n\nWhat are the key issues?\n\nQuestions over the economy have dominated the debate.\n\nThe Scottish government argues the country would be better off after independence, largely based on its taking control of revenues from North Sea oil and gas found in Scottish waters. It says it would manage the energy industry better, invest to boost production, and create a wealth fund, similar to Norway's oil fund, to benefit future generations.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the Scottish government's rosy assessment. A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in March said the latest figures showed Scotland's budget deficit had worsened relative to the rest of the United Kingdom, thanks to falling North Sea revenues and higher public spending north of the border. It also warned of the dangers of relying too heavily on a volatile and ultimately finite income source.\n\nThe Scottish government says the economy is diverse, with other key elements including food and drink, tourism, creative industries, universities, financial services and manufacturing.\n\nAnother big issue is what currency an independent Scotland would have.\n\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond has said he wants Scotland to continue to use the pound in a currency union with the rest of the United Kingdom, and that it has the right to do so.\n\nBut the three main parties in Westminster -- David Cameron's Conservatives, their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats, and Labour -- have all said this won't be an option. The Scottish government responded that this was \"bullying\" from Westminster.\n\nIt's unclear what would happen to Scotland's share of UK debt if it's not part of a currency union.\n\nWhat's the mood?\n\nA series of opinion polls in past months has given the pro-union camp a lead. However, the most recent polls have shown that shrinking or disappearing altogether.\n\nA YouGov poll conducted for The Sunday Times and released on September 7 caused waves when it showed the \"yes\" vote narrowly in the lead for the first time, excluding undecided voters. YouGov President Peter Kellner said it indicated support for the Better Together campaign had fallen \"at an astonishing rate.\"\n\nOf course, it's just one poll among many.\n\nThe latest poll of polls by ScotCen, an independent research center, shows the \"no\" camp hanging onto a narrow lead over the \"yes\" camp, but the gap continues to close.\n\nMany in the Yes campaign feel they have a momentum of support that will build toward the September 18 vote.\n\nBut the No campaigners are confident they represent the silent majority who, after considering all the factors involved, will decide against independence.\n\nWhat would happen if Scotland votes Yes?\n\nShould Scots defy Westminster's expectation and vote \"yes,\" there will be a flurry of activity to ensure everything is in place for Salmond's projected independence date of 24 March, 2016.\n\nUpon confirmation of a victory, the Yes Scotland leader will put together his \"Team Scotland\" negotiating team. It is expected to include his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, alongside a broad, cross-party group.\n\nCameron -- if he hasn't been forced to resign after presiding over the breakup of the UK's 300-year-old union -- will need to form his own negotiating side.\n\nChief among the matters up for negotiation are the currency union and Scotland's share of the UK's national debt, the relocation of the Trident fleet and even potential border controls. The \"yes\" campaign has said it intends for Scotland to remain part of the Common Travel Area, which allows free movement for citizens of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.\n\nCameron will have to move quickly to avoid financial instability by giving a definitive answer to the currency question, and there has been suggestion that the next UK general election -- scheduled for May 2015 -- might be postponed until after Scotland has exited the union.\n\nThe Scottish government would have to set in motion a process to produce a written constitution. Queen Elizabeth II would remain head of state.\n\nAn independent Scotland would also have to negotiate paths to membership for both NATO and the European Union, two international organizations that the \"yes\" campaign says are in Scotland's future.\n\nRecommended",

                    "body": "(CNN) -- On September 18, Scots go to the polls to vote on the future of their country.\n\nIt's a vote that could end Scotland's 307-year union with England and Wales as Great Britain -- and see it launch into the world as an independent nation of some 5.3 million people.\n\nWhen campaigning began, that seemed a far-fetched prospect. But the most recent polls suggest that what many Britons consider unthinkable could happen -- and the United Kingdom as we know it could be torn asunder.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the landmark referendum.\n\nWhat are the Scottish voting on, and why?\n\nVoters will be presented with a simple yes/no question: Should Scotland be an independent country?\n\nThe Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, says this is a \"once in a generation opportunity\" for Scotland's people to take control of the decisions that affect them most. A \"yes\" vote means that \"Scotland's future will be in Scotland's hands,\" it says, and that life will be better and fairer for its people.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron wants Scotland to remain part of an undivided United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He says that it is a decision solely for the Scottish people -- but that remaining part of the United Kingdom will give them security and strength. \"There will be no going back,\" he warns.\n\nBecause the United Kingdom has no written constitution, there's no established law to govern the process. So these are truly uncharted waters.\n\nWhy is this significant to the rest of the world?\n\nThe question mark over Scotland's future is already having an impact on domestic and international business. Some worry that the breakup of the United Kingdom could undermine London's standing as an international financial capital.\n\nLast month, 130 business leaders published an open letter in which they warned of the impact of uncertainty over issues including currency, regulation, tax, pensions, EU membership and support for Scottish exports. A day later, more than 200 other business leaders signed an open letter backing an independent Scotland.\n\nThe British pound sank Monday after the first poll that showed the \"yes\" vote in the lead, with CNN Money reporting that it reflected uncertainty over the outcome of the referendum and an increased risk of a \"messy divorce.\"\n\nThe UK's defense capability could be affected. The Scottish government says it wants to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland as soon as possible -- namely, the UK Trident nuclear submarine fleet based at Faslane. The Scottish government says, \"It is our firm position that an independent Scotland should not host nuclear weapons and we would only join NATO on that basis.\"\n\nScotland would have to renegotiate its entry to both NATO and the European Union if it votes for independence. EU leaders have signaled they would take a hard line and make Scotland apply to join like any other independent nation. However, the \"yes\" campaign says it could easily be done through amendments to existing treaties.\n\nIf Scotland chooses to split from Britain, it could give other people ideas.\n\nThe debate is being closely watched by independence movements in Spain's Catalonia province, Canada's Quebec province and France's Mediterranean island of Corsica.\n\nIf Scotland votes to leave, the British Prime Minister will likely come under pressure to resign -- although he has told UK media \"emphatically\" he will not do so. The major Westminster parties have promised to devolve more powers to Scotland if it chooses to stay in the union.\n\nWho can vote?\n\nThanks to a bill passed last year extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, almost everyone living in Scotland who is 16 or older on the day of the referendum will be able to vote.\n\nThis means English or Welsh citizens who reside in Scotland can take part. But Scots who are living elsewhere in the United Kingdom or overseas will not be entitled to cast a ballot.\n\nIt also means that the residents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland get no say on a historic change to the makeup of the United Kingdom.\n\nWhat's the history behind the vote?\n\nScotland has long had a testy relationship with its more populous neighbor. The Act of Union in 1707 joined the kingdom of Scotland with England and Wales, but many Scots were unhappy at being yoked to their longtime rival south of the border.\n\nSince 1999, Scotland has had a devolved government, meaning many, but not all, decisions are made at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh.

                    "body": "The leaders of the three main Westminster parties are in Scotland today as the fight to keep the UK together intensifies ahead of next week's Scottish independence referendum.\n\nDavid Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg will all head north on separate visits in a bid to persuade Scots to vote No to independence, offering instead a fast-tracked timetable for further devolution.\n\nBut Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said the \"panicked\" visit would only serve to galvanise support for a Yes vote on September 18.\n\nWith momentum apparently gathering behind the pro-independence campaign, the unionist parties have been revising their plans for more powers to be handed to Holyrood in the event of a No vote.\n\nIn a dramatic move yesterday the Prime Minister and Labour leader announced they would not be taking part in their weekly exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, saying instead they would be heading to Scotland, where they will be \"'listening and talking to voters\" about the choice they face next week.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister will also be on the campaign trail in Scotland, as polls increasing suggest the contest is too close to call.\n\nMr Salmond instantly dismissed the move as a sign of the \"disarray\" in the pro-union campaign.\n\nHe said today: \"I relish David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg coming to Scotland - collectively, they are the least trusted Westminster leaders ever, and this day-trip will galvanise the Yes vote. No-one believes their panicked pledges - it is a phoney timetable for measly powers. A Yes vote delivers a real timetable for the full powers that Scotland needs.\n\n\"More and more people in Scotland are waking up to the fact only with the powers of independence can we secure real job creating powers and ensure that our National Health Service is fully protected.\"\n\nHe spoke out as the Yes campaign published a new advert, which claimed that \"Labour and Tory politicians are cosying up together to make up phoney timetables for a few, very few, powers for Scotland\".\n\nMore business leaders have also come out in favour of leaving the UK, with 100 putting their names to another newspaper advert taken out by the group Business for Scotland.\n\nMr Salmond said: \"I'm delighted more businessmen and women have today announced they are backing Scottish independence.\n\n\"They understand that only with the full range of economic powers available to us can we create new jobs and generate more investment.\n\n\"Now that David Cameron is paying a panicked visit to Scotland, it is high time he found the courage of his convictions and agreed to debate the issues with me. The No side have lost their poll lead, and people are switching directly over to Yes - if David Cameron thinks he is the answer to the No campaign's disintegration disarray, let him put his case to the test in a head-to-head debate.\"\n\nMr Cameron has already given his backing to a timetable for transferring more powers that was outlined by his predecessor in Number 10, Labour's Gordon Brown.\n\nThis could see work towards this begin next Friday, the day after the referendum, if there is a No vote, while draft legislation could be drawn up by January.\n\nIn an article for the Daily Mail, the Prime Minister argued a \"brighter future for Scotland rests not only on staying in the UK, but also on having significant new powers\" adding that the new timetable would give Scots the \"clarity\" they need when considering which way to vote.\n\nMr Cameron said: \"With this timetable, we are giving people that clarity, showing that by voting No, Scotland gets the best of both worlds: power over the policies that matter, and the stability of the United Kingdom; the freedom to chart its own destiny, and the support of three other nations; the reputation in the world as a successful nation, and the clout of a world-renowned union.\n\n\"But where we offer clarity, those who support separation offer only question marks. Just eight days away from the referendum, they are still unclear on what money Scotland could use without the pound sterling. The plan for Scotland to enter the EU is a blank page. The formula for filling the public services funding deficit is a blank space.\n\n\"While a Yes vote may be a lucky dip, a No vote is a guaranteed win for anyone who wants a stronger, more autonomous Scotland.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister added: \"The United Kingdom is a precious and special country. That is what is at stake. So let no-one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart.\"\n\nFormer prime minister Sir John Major has warned the UK's international standing would be \"diminished\" should Scotland vote Yes in the independence referendum.\n\nSir John said he hopes Scotland will not vote to break away when it votes on September 18 and warned Britain would be \"damaged\", leading to a decline in its role on the international stage including within the European Union and United Nations.\n\nIt comes as leaders of all three major parties travel to Scotland to attempt to boost the No campaign in the wake of recent polls suggesting pro-independence supporters had seized a narrow lead.\n\nWriting in the Times, the former Conservative prime minister said: \"I believe Scotland and the whole of the UK as a whole would be damaged. We need one another and, if separated, would all face unwelcome and unanticipated change.\n\n\"If the UK lost Scotland, it would be diminished - be in no doubt about that. Our defence would be severely weakened. Trident would almost certainly be lost. Britain's role as the second largest military force in the EU would be gone and, with it, many of our close ties to the United States.\n\n\"The UK would be weaker in every international body and, most damagingly, within the European Union. Our chance of reforming the EU would be diminished, and the risk of our exit from it enhanced. Britain's place as a member of the permanent five of the United Nations would no longer be viable.\"\n\nSir John, who said he opposed devolution 20 years ago, added a Yes vote could also lead to calls for independence from Wales.\n\nScottish Independence Vote further reading\n\nQueen will not be dragged into Scottish independence debate, Palace warns No camp\n\nScottish independence: Unionists in Northern Ireland can expect a border poll of their own in the not-too-distant future\n\nWestminster elite in a panic as more voters are backing Scottish independence, says Alex Salmond\n\nUK is the envy of the world, David Cameron tells Scots\n\nScottish independence: Scotland is different...you only have to watch Braveheart or read the 1707 Act of Union to see how different\n\nScottish 'yes' is a big no, no according to Peter Scudamore\n\nScottish independence: Whether Yes or No, we can learn lessons from the Scots\n\nShift towards Yes camp up by 38% as campaigns neck-and-neck according to TNS Scotland survey\n\nGordon Brown makes devolution vow in bid to spike Yes campaign guns\n\nEconomist warns Scotland 'to be afraid of independence'\n\nScottish Referendum: Wait and see the outcome before dealing with any implications, says Martin McGuinness\n\nNo and Yes neck and neck, poll says\n\nScottish independence: Yes vote would have repercussions on border control\n\nScotland swings to Yes but Alex Salmond isn't resting on his laurels\n\nScots offered more powers if they reject independence\n\nPro-independence Yes campaign leads polls for first time in Scottish referendum battle\n\nScottish independence: Logic of staying in United Kingdom is slow to sink in\n\nScottish independence: A matter for the head and heart\n\nReferendum outcome won't affect us - SDC Trailers aims to stay close to hauliers\n\nScotland independence could bring tax breaks for North Sea oil industry\n\nAlistair Darling: Scottish independence referendum will go right to the wire\n\nScottish independence: Trade and cultural links too strong to ever break\n\nScottish referendum: London sells us short in buying No vote",

                    "body": "Next week the people of Scotland will decide in a referendum whether they want to remain part of the UK or strike out on their own as an independent nation. With polls suggesting Scotland may leave the union, Keri Phillips looks at the background to this remarkable experiment in democracy.\n\nThree hundred years ago, Scotland shared a crown with England but was largely independent. Its union with England was a financial necessity, as the Scottish economy had been brought to its knees by a disastrous attempt to build a trading empire based on a colony in Dari\u00e9n, a province in Panama.\n\nDespite the union, a sense of Scottish identity has been constant, and the discovery of oil in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland at the end of the 1960s provided the spark to ignite Scotland's push for independence.\n\n'The movement for formal independence really comes on the scene with the emergence of the Scottish National Party in the middle of the 1970s,' says David McCrone, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Edinburgh. 'The Scottish National Party, which had been formed in the 1920s and was a kind of small, somewhat eccentric party, a cultural party, I suppose, really benefited from the discovery of oil in the North Sea and hit on the slogan \"It's Scotland's Oil\".'\n\n'It wasn't legally Scotland's oil but it certainly was ... morally, they said, Scotland's oil. At a stroke in many ways it wiped out the rationale for the union, which is that Scotland was better off within the United Kingdom rather than outside it. It opened up the possibility of independence, and indeed the SNP came from virtually nothing in the polls to 30 per cent in the 1970s.'\n\nThese low rumblings of Scottish nationalism were noted by the British Labour Party, which has traditionally relied on winning almost all the Scottish seats to gain office in Westminster. So when Labour returned to government in 1997 after the long Thatcher era, it allowed the Scots a referendum on a Scottish Parliament, hoping this would be enough to keep a lid on the demand for complete independence. The vote went three to one in favour of devolution, and in 1999 Queen Elizabeth opened a new Scottish Parliament. Although Scotland had always had its own legal system, devolution, as it was known, gave people in Scotland direct control of domestic affairs -- health, education and policing -- the things, McCrone argues, that matter to people.\n\nRelated: The Church of Scotland's role in the referendum\n\n'Very quickly the Scottish Parliament became the Parliament in people's eyes, and indeed the Westminster politicians who were left with control over macroeconomic policy and foreign affairs and defence discovered very quickly that they dropped out of the media attention,' says McCrone.\n\n'In the early days it was controlled by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who in many respects had been the architects of devolution, as we called it. But they lost power in 2007. The SNP formed a minority government in 2007. People in Scotland thought they had done a reasonably good job, and to everyone's surprise and I suspect also the Nationalists, they were swept to power with an overall majority in 2011.'\n\nAlthough the vote for the SNP in 2011 can't be seen as a direct reflection of the level of support for independence, the party's astonishing outright win under a voting system designed to always produce minority governments gave them the moral authority to press the UK government for a referendum on the issue.\n\nAs with Australia's referendum on a republic in 1999, there was plenty of argument over just what the question should be, although both governments eventually agreed on the question: should Scotland be an independent country? Neither side was totally happy, though. The major UK political parties, favouring union, had wanted the question to be framed so they could campaign for a yes vote, while the SNP could see that a vote for complete independence would be hard to pull off.\n\nThere was certainly support for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament. The UK-wide parties, campaigning as Better Together -- the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties -- have all now come up with plans for more devolution, although they won't be on the ballot paper. Whatever happens, the status quo can't win.\n\nOnce the date and the question were settled and the necessary bills passed in Parliament, the SNP released Scotland's Future, a mammoth 600-page white paper setting out its aspirations.\n\n'It covered everything from health, education, defence, diplomacy, culture, the currency -- everything was covered in that document,' says Alan Taylor, writer for the Scotland Herald and the Sunday Herald. 'The document, which was made freely available to anybody who wanted it, quickly became unavailable because so many people wanted to get their hands on it.'\n\n'Although it was just the SNP's vision of Scotland's future, it provided the basis for an argument; people could look at that and say, \"well, that's their ideas but these are our ideas\". What was interesting about it was that people had taken the time to think about what Scotland would be like in an independent future.'\n\nOne of the unusual features of the campaign for Scotland's independence referendum has been the extraordinary degree to which it has engaged people. The prediction is that on 18 September there will be a remarkably high turnout, perhaps as high as 80 per cent. At the last Scottish government elections the figure was closer to 50 per cent.\n\n'The debate at a grassroots level has been totally phenomenal,' says Taylor. 'There are public debates happening all over the country, in town halls, churches, libraries, the universities, within businesses, some formally organised, others internally organised. These are attended by hundreds of people; they are packed out, standing-room-only affairs.'\n\n'Then of course you've got this sort of street-level debate where the various parties are out on the street petitioning and arguing and discussing with people. I was in my local pub last night and within 10 minutes of me being in there, there was a great heated debate about the televised debate that was on Monday night. So this is something that is at the forefront of people's minds in Scotland. This is really about their future but it's also about their children's future and it's about the future direction of the country. It is a chance actually to remake and reinvent Scotland.'\n\nRelated: Scottish independence and the case for 'yes'\n\nWhile the Better Together side has argued for the known certainties of union, those for independence are asking voters to take a big step into the unknown. As the debate has intensified, two economic issues have generated much heat.\n\nThe first is North Sea oil, the vital source of an independent Scotland's income. The SNP's Alex Salmond argues there is enough to set up a sovereign wealth fund similar to Norway's, ensuring Scotland's future prosperity, while the opposition maintains that it's a dwindling resource that will become more difficult to recover. The second is the SNP's intention to keep the British pound as currency. The three main British parties have officially ruled out sharing sterling with an independent Scotland and have refused to negotiate over how a currency union would work. Political factors are also at play.\n\n'Amongst the factors that seem to me to be playing to the public are the prospect of a Tory-free Scotland,' says Chris Whatley, professor of Scottish history at the University of Dundee. 'There has been a great deal of resentment or certainly resentment has been drummed up about the fact that we've had, since Mrs Thatcher really, a number of conservative governments which the Scots didn't vote for and that the Scots have some different values and would have done things differently.'\n\n'There is also a strong feeling, certainly it goes down well at public meetings, that Scotland can be nuclear free, that the UK nuclear submarine base at Faslane would be closed and the nuclear submarines would be sent south of the border somewhere.'\n\nAlthough some people have argued that the rest of the UK should also be allowed to vote on Scottish independence on the grounds that it would affect the whole country, only those living and registered to vote in Scotland will be able to. This includes British citizens, as well as citizens from the EU and the Commonwealth living there.\n\nThe Scottish government has also passed special legislation allowing 16-year-olds to vote. During the past few weeks the lead of the 'no' vote has been slipping and over the weekend, a YouGov poll showed the 'yes' camp ahead with 51 per cent, with 'no' on 49 per cent. The referendum will be won by a simple plurality of votes.\n\n'In political terms, the greater the gap between \"yes\" and \"no\", certain things would happen,' says David McCrone. 'For example, if it's a marginal \"yes\", then is that a mandate for independence?'\n\n'If there is an overall \"no\" vote of 55 to 45, then you're really left with a substantial minority of people who are in favour of independence.'\n\nIndependence for Scotland would have enormous implications for the major political parties at Westminster, especially Labour. Scotland has 59 seats at Westminster, predominantly held by Labour Party members.\n\nIf Scotland was to become independent there would be no Scottish MPs at Westminster and at a stroke the Labour Party in the UK would lose 50 MPs. Labour could be politically disadvantaged for a generation. An independent Scotland would also diminish the international standing of what remained of the United Kingdom.\n\nNo matter the result of the referendum on 18 September, McCrone says things in Scotland will never be the same.\n\n'There is a considerable amount of below-the-radar discussion of what kind of Scotland people want to have. I know a lot of Labour supporters who say we need to get back to what they call real politics but actually this is the real politics.'\n\n'Although they would like to think that all of this is back in a cupboard and we don't have to worry about it anymore, things can never be the same again, to use Yeats' term, things have changed, changed utterly.'",

                    "body": "The polls are tightening and decision day is drawing nearer. In this extensive interactive feature we hear from the key figures in the debate - from the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon to Better Together's Alistair Darling - and the Scottish voters, about a decision that will be felt for generations\n\nOn 18 September voters in Scotland will be asked to make the greatest democratic constitutional decision in their nation's history. The question is simple: should Scotland be an independent country, yes or no? - but the impact will be felt for generations.\n\nThe final weeks of the campaign have seen a dramatic narrowing of the no lead in some polls and a growing sense of panic in Westminster that Scotland might do the unthinkable and break away.\n\nA yes vote will have profound consequences for Scotland and the rest of the UK. Even with a no vote, the status quo isn't an option. Promises of further devolution to the Scottish parliament have made by all the main parties.\n\nAs the campaign enters its final phase, what is certain is that Scotland stands on the brink of fundamental change.\n\nVoters complain that neither side will give them unspun and undisputed facts. But the unprecedented nature of the constitutional change being proposed means there are many scenarios that are simply unknowable. The literature sent to households this summer by both the UK and Scottish governments focuses on economic matters - currency, jobs, funding for public services, Scotland's national wealth - but the arguments for and against independence inhabit more politicised and emotional territory as well.\n\nOne of the central arguments made by the yes campaign is that independence will allow those living in Scotland to decide how that wealth is spent.\n\nA key element of this is the debate around the worth and longevity of Scotland's oil reserves. The yes campaign argues that the country's growing economy, not based on oil alone, will be capable of sustaining welfare spending, including its pensions debt and the childcare plans that were a flagship policy in the Scottish government's white paper.\n\nPower to decide how to spend its entire budget would allow Scotland to scrap the spending on nuclear weapons that it is committed to as part of the UK - and spend the money on \"bairns not bombs\", as one bumper sticker has it. Because Trident is based at Faslane this would leave the rest of the UK seeking a new location for its nuclear deterrent scheme.\n\nAlthough just under half of the Scottish electorate opposes nuclear weapons, Trident has become one of the totemic issues of the yes campaign, along with the ability never again to be involved in a war like Iraq, and used as proof that if Scotland were to make its own choices it would make different choices.\n\nAnother key part of the pro-independence argument is that of the democratic deficit: independence would allow the Scottish electorate to have the governments they vote for. Scotland consistently votes to the left of the rest of the UK. Since 2001, the country has voted only one Conservative MP into Westminster but is now governed by a Conservative-led coalition.\n\nAn independent Scotland would most likely never again be ruled by a Conservative government, independence supporters argue. The SNP is quick to point out that this does not automatically mean electoral success for its own party, but rather bolsters the argument that this referendum is not about party politics but about a once in a lifetime opportunity for the people of Scotland to ensure that at each and every future election they will get the government of their choice.\n\nUtter disillusionment with government from Westminster - most immediately anger at current austerity measures - pervades the yes campaign.\n\nOne of the most consistent messages in favour of independence that has been driven home in recent months has been that a yes vote is the only way to rid the country of the cuts and privatisation agenda imposed upon it by a distant government.\n\nWith this comes a belief that an independent Scotland would create a better society for its people, in terms of fairness and social justice as well as economic prosperity. The argument for independence is fundamentally about hope for a better future for generations to come.\n\nThe expectation is that, by governing itself, Scotland would become a more socially democratic, equal and progressive place, with the motivation to address its most pressing problems of child poverty and poor adult health and care for its most vulnerable members.\n\nThe no campaign has been relentless in highlighting the risks of independence to the Scottish economy. These include the uncertainties over what currency the country would use in the event of a yes vote, as well as raising doubts over the reliability of oil reserves and how the country will pay for its public services, in particular in relation to its ageing population.\n\nIt underlines the threat to jobs if businesses pull out of Scotland as some have threatened to in the event of a yes vote, and notes that economic instability would be exacerbated by uncertainties around Scotland's continued membership of Europe.\n\nBetter Together, the official campaign supported by the Westminster parties against independence, argues that the Scottish government has made cynical promises to the electorate, falling short on crucial detail and presenting independence as a magic wand to solve all of Scotland's social ills.\n\nIt argues that the white paper, the Scottish government's own policy vision for independence, is full of uncosted projections that rely on unknowable future circumstances.\n\nOthers doubt that dreams of a more socially democratic Scotland match the reality of current Scottish government policies, in particular in relation to its policies on taxation.\n\nA counter argument is made to the one of a more progressive Scotland after independence, which questions why Scots would want to end their solidarity with those in need elsewhere across the UK.\n\nBetter Together has been criticised for relying on scare tactics about the economy and failing to present any positive vision for staying within the union.\n\nBut the no campaign has attempted to move beyond a defence of the status quo, highlighted the shared history of the union and the institutions that bind it together, including the BBC.\n\nLabour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives all emphasise the huge achievements of the Scottish parliament after 15 years of devolution and set out just how much more Holyrood is capable of on its continuing \"home rule journey\".\n\nBut all three parties also guarantee that Scotland will be given more powers in the event of a no vote, although they have yet to set out a detailed joint plan for this.\n\nThe yes and no campaigns have been markedly different in their strategies, mainly because the pro-independence side quickly developed into a grassroots movement that extends well beyond the official Yes Scotland organisation or the SNP. This grassroots energy has resulted in town hall meetings, arts festivals and coffee mornings for undecided voters springing up across the country.\n\nThe no camp has not been so publicly visible, but is just as active. While the yes campaign is defined by its enthusiastic volunteers, Better Together is focusing on far more forensic methods, having amassed a vast database of voters, which allows it to identify and target crucial undecided voters as well as shoring up its core supporters.\n\nTactics\n\nThe yes and no campaigns have been markedly different in their strategies.

Cameron's UK government has emphatically ruled out sharing the pound and the Bank of England with Scotland, and will press hard for Trident to remain in Scotland. Without a favourable deal on Trident, Scotland will find it hard to join Nato.\n\nIf the UK parties refuse to share sterling, Scotland's economic future will depend heavily on its currency decisions and the reaction of banks and major investors. The time needed to negotiate EU membership is uncertain.\n\nThe EU is likely to demand that Scotland loses the UK rebate and UK opt-outs on VAT and working hours. It would need to negotiate a share of North Sea oil, its share of the UK's debt and a deal to set up an independent welfare state and tax system, which could take until 2020 to establish.\n\nIf Scotland votes no\n\nIf Scotland votes no on 18 September, the UK parties are promising to give the Scottish parliament much greater power over taxation and policy-making, and to do so quickly, to increase its autonomy within the UK.\n\nFaced with rising support for independence, the UK parties are already separately pledging to extend income tax powers and to run housing benefits in Scotland, which would give Holyrood control over at least \u00a315bn more of its spending. But with the tightening of the polls they are these week unveiling fresh joint pledges that take the offer of new fiscal powers closer to the \"devo max\" option that was ruled out when the referendum was first agreed.\n\nPressure may grow for Scottish MPs to have reduced powers at Westminster if Holyrood has greater autonomy. That could reinvigorate demands for independence, and a new referendum after the 2020 Scottish elections. The no campaign has warned of \"neverendums\" without a decisive vote on the 18th.\n\nThe Scottish parliament's total spending is \u00a338.5bn, and it already runs Scotland's courts, prisons, schools and universities, policing and fire services, NHS, farming and fisheries, local government and transport systems.\n\nWestminster has passed a new Scotland Act to allow Holyrood to set a different income tax rate by up to 10p in the pound from 2016, to borrow up to \u00a32bn, to control landfill tax (worth \u00a3100m) and to have a new property sales tax (worth \u00a3236m) to replace stamp duty.\n\nThe three main UK parties are now offering to expand these powers and strengthen local government; some more radically than others. They plan to set up a new devolution commission if there is a no vote.\n\nCurrent party political offers on further devolution\n\nThough the question on the ballot paper is binary, the anticipation of answering it has been uniting. The simple fact of the vote has had a quite extraordinary, galvanising, effect on the Scottish population, and the referendum debate has unleashed a degree of civic engagement that has taken even seasoned observers by surprise.\n\nThere has been a dark side: the online abuse, a sense in some areas that people have been scared to express their opinions, and the political spin that confuses the facts. But the grassroots energy is palpable, with interest groups blossoming across the country.\n\nScotland may not be any more egalitarian or servile, optimistic or canny than England, Wales or Northern Ireland, but it has in recent months become a place full of individuals doing things that they have never done before: taking part in campaigning, attending public meetings, having conversations about the future they want for themselves and their children with an urgency they have never before displayed.\n\nWhat the voters say\n\nThe springboard for the referendum was the Scottish National party's surprise landslide victory in the May 2011 Scottish parliament elections, 77 years after the pro-independence party was founded.\n\nIt gave Salmond, the SNP leader, the first ever majority at the devolved parliament at Holyrood and a mandate for the referendum. Until the Scottish parliament was set up in 1999, the SNP had been a minority party, with only a handful of MPs at Westminster. The surprise majority meant Salmond was able to act on his party's longstanding promise to have a referendum.\n\nBut Salmond needed the UK government's legal approval for the vote. In January 2012 David Cameron, the UK prime minister, offered to give that power to Holyrood but only if Salmond dropped plans for a second referendum question on giving Holyrood more devolved powers.\n\nIn October 2012, the two leaders signed the Edinburgh agreement setting up the referendum - one of the first times a national government has voluntarily agreed to help part of its country vote on leaving.\n\nWith only about a third of Scottish voters supporting the SNP, it has built a loose rainbow coalition with other parties, including the Scottish Green party and socialist parties, to get closer to the 51% needed to win the referendum. Other non-party pro-independence groups have sprung up, including an artists' group, a women's campaign and a group of Labour party members.",

Now it's David Cameron and Ed Miliband.\n\n14.35: The Labour First Minister of Wales has called on Scots to resist the \"siren call\" of independence\n\nCarwyn Jones said some Labour voters could vote Yes in a bid to \"break the shackles of a Tory-led Westminster government\" but warned them to resist the nationalists' \"promise of a socialist utopia post separation\".\n\n14.30 International investors have been warned to pull their cash out of Britain to protect themselves against the 'cataclysmic' impact of Scottish independence\n\nJapan's biggest bank, Nomura, has advised clients to slash financial exposure to the UK and brace for a possible collapse of the pound after polls showed the independence campaign running neck and neck, warning that the separation of England and Scotland after more than 300 years would be a \"cataclysmic shock\".\n\n14.15: The Saltire will fly above Downing Street in a show of support for the Union in the run up to the Scottish referendum this afternoon.\n\nThe Prime Minister wants other councils across England to follow suit after a poll at the weekend put the yes vote ahead for the first time following a late surge in support for succession.\n\nMr Cameron's decision to raise the blue and white flag came after Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, called on town halls across the country to appeal for Scotland to stay in the union.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Official Spokesman denied that the decision was \"trite\" or \"patronising\". He said: \"One of the points that he made to Cabinet was that domestically there is nothing more important than the future of the UK and the future of Scotland in the coming days,\" he said.\n\n\"The Prime Minister has been very clear in his message that we want Scotland to stay. I would put the fact that the Saltire will be flying over No 10 firmly in that context.\"\n\n13.57: Peter Dominiczak, our Politcal Editor, says that Mark Carney's comments will come as a \"major blow\"\n\nHe writes: \"His comments will come as a major blow to Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP, who has insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to keep the pound.\n\n\"It is a significant hardening of Mr Carney's position against sharing the currency.\n\n\"All three main political parties have ruled out a currency union with an independent Scotland.\"\n\n13.10: Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England has said a currency union between Scotland and rest of UK post-independence \"is incompatible with sovereignty\"\n\nHe told the TUC conference: \"We take note of all the positions of all of the Westminster parties to rule out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK, so it is in that context if you put it together so it is in that context a currency union is incompatible with sovereignty.\"\n\nMr Carney said that there are three components of a currency union - have free movement of capital, labour, service and trade, a banking union with the same regulations and supervision on both sides and a fiscal arrangement that would stabilise \"inevitable fluctuations\" between the economies.\n\nHe added: \"We only have to look across the channel to see what happens if you don't have all of those components in place, and that's just the economics of it.\"\n\n12.45: David Cameron has spoken out on his decision to abandon PMQs and head to Scotland\n\nHe said that Westminster is not the \"right place\" for party leaders to be tomorrow but that he should be in Scotland \"listening to people, talking to people\"\n\nMr Cameron has so far resisted too many high profile trips North of the Border because his Southern, public school, Conservative image is seen to be toxic with voters. However the decision marks a shift in policy by all parties since the dramatic closing of the polls - leaders, however unpopular with Scots, cannot be seen to be sitting on their hands awaiting next week's vote.\n\nHe said: \"We all agree passionately that the United Kingdom is better off if we stay together. So tomorrow the right place to be isn't at Westminster at Prime Minister's Questions, it's being in Scotland, listening to people, talking to people.\n\n\"We'll all have our own ways, separately, of talking about why we're better together. But one thing I'm sure we'll all say is that it's a matter for people in Scotland to decide, but we want you to stay.\n\n\"I really care about this issue. I care passionately about our United Kingdom and I want to do everything I can to put the arguments in front of the people. In the end, it is for the Scottish people to decide, but I want them to know that the rest of the United Kingdom - and I speak as Prime Minister - want them to stay.\n\n\"So all those steps we can take, making sure that people in Scotland know that they can have the best of both worlds, more powers to govern themselves, but also being inside the United Kingdom. As I've said, we'll all have our own way of making this point about the United Kingdom being better together. But one message I'm sure we'll all have in common is it's a matter for the Scottish people, but we want you to stay.\"\n\nMr Cameron refused to respond to a questions about whether it was a \"desperate, last ditch move\" or whether he could be forced to resign in the event of a Yes vote.\n\nBen Riley-Smith, Scottish Political Correspondent has this analysis of Alex Salmond's as the wind fills the sails of the Yes Campaign\n\nAlex Salmond spent close to an hour mobbed by activists and journalists from every possible media outlet this morning in a scrum of questions and photographs.\n\nLess than a fortnight ago, the First Minister was welcomed to a rainy Aberdeenshire garden centre by half a dozen Yes fans and a warm cup of tea.\n\nNow, he's cheered to the rafters at packed Yes events - admittedly carefully staged, media friendly events - with the wind apparently in the sails of the pro-independence campaign.\n\nHow can the No camp stop the perceived momentum and will it hold up at the ballot box? Those are fast becoming the key questions as the final week approaches.\n\nThe pro-UK side still hope that when each voter is alone at the polls on September 18, far away from the noise with pen in hand, those unanswered questions will come to the fore.\n\nWill Scots really vote Yes with the country's currency, pensions, EU membership and financial industry hanging in the balance, they ask. The pro-UK camp are banking on the fuzzy warmth wrapped up in a Yes vote will fade on the day.\n\nIs that true, I asked one the First Minister's top men. Will there be a late swing to status quo? \"Momentum swallows all in front of it,\" he said, especially in an either/or referendum choice.\n\nThe eyes, dancing with excitement, said it all. Make no mistake - these guys believe a Yes vote is coming.\n\n12.55 Unexpected people are showing their support for the \"yes\" campaign, here a bride to be rom America announces her allegiance\n\nRuth Cheadle from California holds YES banner prior to her wedding at a nearby church\n\n12.25: A form of PMQs will be held without the party leaders and led by William Hague tomorrow, No. 10 have said\n\n12.04 In a very rare move David Cameron has announced that Prime Minister's Questions has been cancelled for tomorrow so the party leaders can all head to Scotland\n\nA joint statement from David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg reads:\n\n\"There is a lot that divides us - but there's one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together.\n\n\"That's why all of us are agreed the right place for us to be tomorrow is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster.\n\n\"We want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choice they face.\n\n\"Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: 'We want you to stay.'\"\n\n11.30: Alex Salmond dismisses idea that the Queen would oppose Scottish independence\n\nSimon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor, has this report:\n\nAlex Salmond today rejected reports the Queen is opposed to Sottish independence, arguing she would be happy to be \"Queen of Scots\" after a Yes vote but it was proper she make no public statement.\n\nThe First Minister said he wanted the Queen to remain head of state in a separate Scotland \"as her ancestors were\", although many Nationalists are republicans who want to get rid of the monarchy.\n\nRejecting reports she is worried about the break-up of Britain, he said: \"I think Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots as indeed we indeed have been proud to have her as the monarch.\"\n\nMr Salmond, who has regular private meetings with the Queen, was pressed whether she had expressed her views about separation. He said he met her at Balmoral a fortnight ago but the \"proper position\" was that she remain neutral.\n\n\"One thing that the poll showed at the weekend in addition to the substantial move to the Yes campaign is the enthusiasm of the people of Scotland to have Her Majesty the Queen as our Queen of Scots.\"\n\n11.26: It's too late, many people have already voted, Dr Duncan Ross, senior lecturer in economic and social history at the University of Glasgow warns\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Many people have voted, including myself. What it [Brown's timetable] does look like is utter panic. You have a poll coming out first thing on Sunday morning showing the Yes campaign ahead.\n\n\"George Osborne as quickly as he possibly can gets himself on the TV news saying there will be new powers. Gordon Brown is raised from wherever he has been to talk about what these new powers might be. I think it is panic - it is far too late.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the Labour Party and others had really wanted to put these new powers before the Scottish people they should have done it a very long time ago.\"\n\n10.52: Alex Salmond has declared this the day that the No Campaign \"fell apart at the seams\"\n\nThe First Minister dismissed the plans for devolving further power to Scotland announced today as a \"retreading, a repackaging and a re-timetabling\" of what has been said before. He added it was \"nothing approaching\" the powers the Yes Campaign believes Scotland needs.\n\nThe leaders of the Westminster parties, he said, have a \"minus 100\" rating in Scotland. He added: \"I've never seen a campaign disintegrate in the way that the No campaign is disintegrating now.\"\n\nChristopher Hope, Senior Politcal Correspondent, reports from Edinburgh's Royal Mile:\n\n\"There is an expectant air here on the steps of St Giles Cathedral.

(The No camp would argue Scotland will be kicked out and forced to reapply with a Yes vote.)\n\nThe activists are holding signs declaring \"Yes\" in a variety European languages - German, Spanish, Polish, Gaelic. There are flags too - though the Union Jack is a notable absence.\n\nOne grey-haired man in a Croatia T-shift is asked by a hack if he is Scottish or Croatian. \"A bit of both,\" he responds. \"But I have never, ever in my life been British.\"\n\n10.16: David Cameron invokes the defeat of Hilter in bid to get Business leaders to campaign for a 'no' vote\n\nIn his most impassioned comments yet David Cameron has invoked Britain's defeat of Hitler as part of a plea to hundreds of business leaders on Monday aimed at preventing Scotland voting for independence next week.\n\nSky News reports that the Prime Minister told a drinks reception of 200 of Britain's most influential business leaders that the United Kingdom had fought and won the Second World War together and it must remain undivided.\n\nSir Richard Broadbent, chairman of Tesco; Baroness Brady, the West Ham United vice-chairman; Sir Ian Cheshire, chief executive of DIY retail group Kingfisher; Sir Philip Green, the Top Shop billionaire and Michael Ward, the boss of Harrods were among those attending the exclusive event.\n\nSir Ian, the chief executive of Kingfisher plc which runs B&Q, now intends to spell out the risks he sees in a \"yes\" vote today. He will warn that prices would rise for consumers in an independent Scotland as it would be smaller and that risks associated with referendum mean investment decisions have been on hold for several months.\n\n10.03: There is discussion on Twitter about what the United Kingdom would be called in the case of a 'Yes' vote\n\nJim Pickard of the Financial Times plumps for \"The Disunited Kingdom\" while Kaya Burgess of The Times favours \"The Untied Kingdom\", thoughts?\n\nTwitter: Jim Pickard - What would the UK be renamed if the Scots go it alone?

She said her party would go into the process \"with good faith\" as all parties want to build a consensus for the plans.\n\nShe added: \"It is a simple fact that the Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons or in Holyrood so we would always be working with other parties in order to deliver this.\"\n\nWillie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, added: \"All three parties are coming together as this is so important.\"\n\n09.20: As the parties gear up to back a cross party deal on new Scottish powers, how did we get here?\n\nChristopher Hope, the Telegraph's Senior Political Correspondent, has this useful timeline tracing the road to the referendum from 1997 to next week's vote and beyond.\n\n09.15: Alex Salmond tells youth of Scotland to grab a granny and convince them to vote yes\n\nThe First Minister is telling young Scots to \"pop round\" to see their grandparents and talk them into voting yes.\n\nWhile the polls are narrowing older voters are firmly against independence with the latest TNS survey showing over 60s were still 70/30 against independence.\n\nThe focus on pensioners is based on a tactic by Barack Obama's supporters whose grans helped him win swing state Florida in the 2008 US presidential race.\n\nAccording to The Sun ways to attract older voters to the 'yes' camp could include offering a free night at the bingo and a packet of Werther's Original sweets and provide them \"cheap pipe and slippers\".\n\n08.35: Angus Robertson, the SNP leader in Westminster, says Yes Campaign is 'rattled' and the timetable shows 'total panic and desperation'\n\nHe told Radio 4's Today: \"We're seeing massive numbers of voters, especially Labour voters, switching to the Yes side; in contrast, we have total panic and desperation from the No side, offering a cynical bribe which is utterly transparent to voters in Scotland.\"\n\nHe added that postal votes have already been issued in Scotland and voters are now being faced with an \"eleventh hour\" offer \"cobbled together\" with \"no detail on any new powers whatsoever\".\n\n08.20: Jim Murphy has poured cold water on Ed Miliband's plans to raise Saltires across Britain in support of the Union\n\nThe Labour MP for East Renfrewshire and Shadow International Development Secretary has just told Radio 4: \"If the folk of England want to fly the Scotland flag ok, but the fact is the Scotland flag here in Scotland is all of our flag, it doesn't belong to the SNP. All nationalists are patriots, but not all patriots are nationalists.\n\n\"You don't have to break up the United Kingdom to prove that you love Scotland.\"\n\nAnd his fellow MP, Graham Allen, Labour MP for Nottingham North, agrees flags will not be enough to reverse the increase in support for the 'yes' campaign.\n\nTwitter: Graham Allen - A message to Councils to fly the Saltire is good , a message to them that we are serious about devolution in England would be even better\n\nMr Murphy added: \"We want to be really clear that if people vote No, they are not voting for No change. Change is coming.\n\n\"As a consequence of what Gordon Brown and the Labour party announced last night, agreed with the other parties, who seem to support it, the day after a No vote the House of Commons will have a motion tabled setting out an approach that will bring new and significant powers to the Scottish Parliament at remarkable speed.\"\n\n08.05: Former president of the UN warns a 'yes' vote could diminish Britain's influence\n\nVuk Jeremic, a former president of the UN General Assembly and a Nobel prize winning economist wrote in The Times that Britain's influence in crucial organisations, including the UN Security Council, the World Bank and the IMF, could be reduced in the event of a \"yes\" vote.\n\nMr Jeremic said: \"A 'yes' vote could also trigger a debate about the future of the crucial veto-wielding permanent seat on the UN Security Council held by the UK.\n\n\"For several years, negotiations on Security Council reform have looked to expand the number of permanent members better to reflect contemporary global dynamics.\n\n\"Little progress has been made to date, but Scottish independence could empower increasingly influential stakeholders to press forward with greater verve.\"\n\nHowever he admitted that Scotland's \"natural and human resources, and sense of identity surely constitute a viable foundation for it to stand alone on the global stage in the future.\"\n\n07.41: \"If Scotland votes for independence, English nationalism could be unleashed - and politicians of all parties would pay the price.\"\n\nVernon Bogdanor, CBE, the research professor at the Institute for Contemporary British History has written a piece for The Telegraph on how the Scottish independence referendum is a defining moment for England too. It is well worth a read.\n\n07.40: Ed Miliband urges councils across England to fly the Saltire to show their support for Scotland staying in the Union\n\nTwitter: Ed Miliband - We want cities, towns and villages across the UK to fly the Saltire and send a message to Scotland: stay with us.\n\nThe Labour leader will raise a Saltire over Liverpool's city council building today said that the flas should be flying across cities, towns and villages to send a message to Scotland to \"stay with us\".\n\nHe said: \"We are starting here in Liverpool by raising the Saltire to show we achieve fairness, equality and social justice better together than we do apart.\"\n\n07.31: Westminster has well and truly woken up to the idea that in nine days Scottish voters could decide to leave the Union.\n\nThis morning a new poll has put the Yes and No campaigns neck and neck, with TNS putting each camp at 50 per cent each once don't know were excluded.\n\nGordon Brown was dramatically rushed out to promise Scotland \"Home Rule\" within six weeks if the country voters to stay in the United Kingdom in a move to take the momentum away from Alex Salmond and the \"Yes\" campaign.\n\nQuestions remain over David Cameron's role in campaign and some of his MPs suggest he could be in \"serious trouble\" with his party for risjing the future of the Union for agreeing to a referendum in the first place.\n\nGood morning, Georgia Graham here.

                    "body": "LONDON (Reuters) - An opinion poll showing Scottish independence campaigners have a slim lead nine days before a crucial referendum has highlighted reasons for the wider world and investors to pay heed to the Sept. 18 vote, which could see Britain lose 5.3 million Scots.\n\nForeign governments and financial markets had long assumed Scots would view independence from the United Kingdom as too risky a leap but the sudden swing, confirmed by another survey showing the two camps neck-and-neck, has exploded such complacency.\n\nLosing Scotland would likely weaken Britain as a power, dent its self-confidence and make it more introverted, increasing doubts about its future in Europe.\n\nA lot of energy has been expended arguing whether an independent Scotland could join the European Union. The European Commission said on Monday it stood by its position that Scotland would have to leave the EU and re-apply for membership.\n\nEven more telling could be Scotland's absence from the debate about whether the rest of the country should remain part of the bloc, on which Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to give voters the final say if he is re-elected next year.\n\nOverall, Scots are far more pro-EU than the English and if they secede in 2016 they would not get a say in the proposed 2017 referendum on Britain's place in Europe.\n\nWithout Scotland, the chances of England, Wales and Northern Ireland voting to leave the EU are greater. Scots may only account for around 4 million of the UK's 45 million voters but with opinion finely divided, that could tip the balance.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said in June the UK would be stronger and more robust if it stuck together and Washington has made abundantly clear it wants Britain to stay in the EU.\n\nScottish nationalist (SNP) leader Alex Salmond says the biggest threat to Scotland staying in the EU is Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out EU referendum.\n\nScottish independence would also alter the calculus for national politics in the rest of the country.\n\nThe opposition centre-left Labour party has 41 members of the Westminster parliament in Scottish seats while the centre-right Conservatives have only one. Take those out of the equation and the path for Labour to win power looks daunting.\n\n\"In Britain, it will mean the end of any chance of Labour winning power,\" former Labour Europe minister Denis Macshane wrote on The Globalist website this week.\n\nWhichever way the Sept. 18 referendum goes, Scots will still vote in a British general election next year, raising another uncertainty. If Labour won, its government might lose its parliamentary majority and fall within a year once its Scottish lawmakers go.\n\nThat loops back to EU membership since the Conservatives are committed to holding a plebiscite while Labour is not.\n\nThe irony is that the Conservatives have traditionally been the strongest defenders of the union and many would be aghast at independence even though it gave their party a permanent electoral advantage in what is left of the United Kingdom.\n\nCameron would face pressure to quit if he lost Scotland. The full name of his party is the Conservative & Unionist Party.\n\nCompounding his woes, a parliamentary by-election in October could deliver the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) a first Westminster seat after the Conservative incumbent defected.\n\nIf Cameron were to go - he says he would not resign - there would be a clamour among the many eurosceptics in his party, and those who fear UKIP will cost them their seats, for a more clearly anti-EU leader to take his place.\n\nThat in turn could harden the chances of a British exit if a new Conservative leader would not campaign to stay in the bloc.\n\nSalmond pressed for a third question on the ballot paper - for more devolved powers. Cameron's rejection of that now looks like a miscalculation as the main parties scramble to promise Scots more autonomy if they vote \"No\".\n\nEven if Scots vote to remain part of the UK, the constitutional genie is out of the bottle. Scotland is bound to get more autonomy if it stays.\n\nWales would almost inevitably demand more powers of its own and the so-called \"West Lothian question\" - why should Scottish and Welsh parliamentarians be allowed to vote on laws that only affect England when English lawmakers cannot do the reverse - would come to a head.\n\nEnglish nationalism, hitherto confined to the right-wing fringe, could take off, requiring a full-blown overhaul of the UK's constitutional settlement.\n\nWhat share of Britain's debt would Scotland take? Would it retain the pound? How much would Scotland get of oil revenues from the North Sea, estimates of which vary wildly? Would it follow a different fiscal policy? Can it join the EU?\n\nThe pound has dropped more than 3 percent against the dollar over the past week as the polls have narrowed dramatically.\n\nThe SNP wants to keep sterling but that is opposed by all the main political parties in London, creating uncertainty which could persist for the 18 months pencilled in for negotiating details of a divorce.\n\nWhat is certain is that minus Scotland, Britain would slip down the ranks from being the world's sixth largest economy.\n\nThere could even be longer-term questions about whether it should keep a seat on the U.N. Security Council and stay in the Group of Seven major economies at a time when power is shifting to the world's big emerging economies.\n\nThe UK economy is Europe's biggest destination for foreign direct investment. Without Scotland those flows would fall and the rest of the UK's current account deficit could rise to a level that discomfits investors.\n\nThe British Treasury has said it would honour all existing government debt regardless of whether Scots vote for independence, a move aimed at preventing bond market volatility.\n\nBut Salmond has said an independent Scotland could walk away from its share of the UK's debt if it were not allowed to use the pound.

                    "body": "The U.K. government promised new powers for Scotland if it votes to remain in the U.K. after a weekend opinion poll showed the Scottish independence campaign in the lead for the first time.\n\nLONDON -- The British government promised new powers for Scotland in areas including taxes, spending and welfare if it votes to remain in the U.K. after a weekend opinion poll showed a surprising surge in support for Scottish independence.\n\nA poll released late Saturday showed pro-independence voters in the lead for the first time since the Scottish referendum campaign began. The shift in sentiment ahead of the Sept. 18 vote raised the prospect that a split that seemed unlikely a few weeks ago is now thinkable. The increase in support also put the spotlight on an array of thorny problems that breaking away would bring, from currency questions and banking-regulation issues to potentially sweeping political consequences.\n\nRelated Five Things to Consider Ahead of Scotland's Independence Vote Pound Falls After Poll MoneyBeat: Reactions to the Poll British Bosses Get Scottish Independence Jitters as Polls Narrow (Sept. 5, 2014) Knock, Knock for Scottish Independence (Sept. 2, 2014) Heard on the Street: Scottish Independence Vote Isn't the Only U.K. Risk\n\nThe British pound plummeted to a near nine-month low on Monday in response to the poll, while Scotland-focused stocks also fell.\n\n\"It is clear that Scotland wants more control over the decisions that affect Scotland,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said on Sunday. \"You will see in the next few days a plan of action to give more powers to Scotland.\"\n\nMr. Osborne said these powers would be put into effect the moment there is a \"no\" vote in the referendum. \"The clock will be ticking for delivering those powers, and then Scotland will have the best of both worlds,\" he said.\n\nScotland's First Minister Alex Salmond dismissed Mr. Osborne's offer, saying it was a sign of panic from the pro-union camp. \"The momentum is decisively with the 'yes' campaign,\" Mr. Salmond said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.\n\nThe Yes Scotland campaign is spearheading the independence drive, while Better Together, backed by all three main political parties in London, is pushing for the union. Nationalists need a simple majority in the Sept. 18 ballot to end Scotland's more than 300-year-old union with England and Wales. The modern U.K. also includes Northern Ireland.\n\nLess than two weeks before Scots head to the polls to vote on whether to secede from the U.K., 47% of those surveyed said \"yes\" to independence, while 45% said \"no,\" according to the survey by pollster YouGov. The rest of the 1,084 voters polled Sept. 2-5 said they were undecided or wouldn't vote.\n\nBy another count, which doesn't include nonvoters and the undecided, 51% of those surveyed supported independence, compared with 49% who are against it, according to the YouGov survey.\n\nPro-independence campaigners hold a tea party on the Scotland-England border on Sunday near the English town of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Getty Images\n\n\"A two-point gap is too small for us to call the outcome,\" said Peter Kellner, the president of YouGov. \"But the fact that the contest is too close to call is itself remarkable, as Better Together seemed to have victory in the bag.\"\n\nThe British pound fell against the dollar in early Asian trading Monday on concerns about the poll's results, sliding to $1.6218 from $1.6325 on Friday.\n\nThe survey attributes the rising support for independence to Mr. Salmond's efforts to calm fears that independence would be too risky for Scotland's economy. The independence campaign is seen as more energetic and optimistic, rallying young and working-class voters, compared with Better Together, which is seen as more negative, according to YouGov.\n\nYouGov is one of several pollsters tracking Scots' voting intentions. Other polls have shown a stronger lead for the pro-union \"no\" camp, but the gap has been narrowing as the referendum draws closer.\n\nNewspapers in London on Sunday bannered news of the Scottish poll, which spurred worries among some residents. \"We're all on the same island, we're all part of the same country, so I don't see why they feel the need to separate,\" said Brian Allsopp, a 45-year-old from north London. \"We should all try to stick together and work through this.\"\n\nThe U.K. government is stepping up its campaigning. Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to speak in Scotland early next week. Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour Party, and Gordon Brown, former U.K. Prime Minister, will also be in Scotland making the case for union this week. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will ride around Scotland in the \"Battle Bus,\" a red coach bus with \"Vote No\" written across it, according to the Scottish Labour Party press office.\n\nScotland's nationalist party proposed the independence referendum when it came to power in 2011 after years as a fringe party. Ministers in Scotland's semiautonomous Parliament in Edinburgh control spending and policies in areas including health, education and transport and have limited tax-raising powers. The U.K. Parliament at Westminster determines foreign and defense policy for the U.K. as a whole and retains control of most taxes and big chunks of spending, including on welfare.\n\nPro-independence Scots see the U.K. government in London as aloof and deaf to Scottish voters' wishes. For them, independence holds the promise that taxes raised in Scotland would be spent in Scotland on benefits such as a better safety net for the poor.\n\nOn the political front, a vote for independence would be a major blow for Mr. Cameron. At the same time, the U.K.'s opposition Labour Party relies heavily on Scottish votes for its success and, without a support base there, would struggle to win elections once Scotland formally secedes.\n\nIn the event of secession, among the biggest uncertainties would be which currency an independent Scotland would use. Scotland's nationalist party says Scotland would continue using sterling, but all three main political parties in London and treasury officials oppose this, saying it would expose British taxpayers to financial risks from a country over which they have no control.

                    "body": "By Peter Dominiczak, Peter Spence, Simon Johnson and Steven Swinford\n\nA number of the world's biggest banks and financial experts have warned of disastrous economic consequences for the UK if Scotland votes for independence.\n\nBarclays, Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, JP Morgan, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse all made dire predictions about the country's finances as they warned clients of the increased risk of investing in Britain in the event of a Yes vote.\n\nDavid Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg meanwhile gambled on a last-ditch visit north of the border to make a final plea for unity, cancelling Prime Minister's Questions to do so.\n\nThe decision by six global financial institutions to raise concerns over the impact of Scottish independence has stoked fears that a Yes vote could reverse the recovery.\n\nOne investment group predicted that Britain's growth will be almost a percentage point lower next year if Scotland votes for independence. Axa Investment Managers said GDP would grow less than 2 per cent, compared with its earlier forecast of 2.7 per cent.\n\nMark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said that an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the pound because it would be \"incompatible with sovereignty\".\n\nSenior Conservative MPs warned of \"economic catastrophe\" across Britain within days of a vote for independence.\n\nCancelling normal business, Messrs Cameron, Miliband and Clegg pledged to visit Scotland to \"listen and talk to voters\". In a joint statement, they said: \"The right place for us to be... is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster.\"\n\nTheir visit is intended to show their commitment to a promise of much greater powers for the Scottish government.\n\nBut it bolstered accusations that the three main party leaders were panicking following a surge in support for Alex Salmond's separatist campaign.\n\nUntil now, Mr Cameron has attempted to keep a relatively low profile because of his unpopularity in Scotland. In other developments yesterday:\n\n* The Prime Minister called on people across England to fly the saltire in a show of unity. However, an attempt to fly the Scottish flag over Downing Street backfired when it fell off the flagpole.\n\n* Mr Salmond indicated that the Queen was at ease with the prospect of Scottish independence after she faced calls from MPs to speak out ahead of the referendum.\n\n* The main parties united behind plans for a \"home rule\" Bill to give the Scottish government more powers in the event of a No vote.\n\n* The Prime Minister invoked Britain's defeat of Hitler in the Second World War as he called for UK business leaders to speak out against independence.\n\n* Mr Salmond was reported to have said, \"what are they going to do - invade?\" when asked about his threat to default on Scotland's share of the national debt.\n\nThe value of sterling has fallen sharply in recent days after polls showed that Scotland is heading towards independence.\n\nFigures released by Societe Generale, the French investment bank, showed an exodus of global money from British companies.\n\nThe bank predicted sterling could drop as much as 5 per cent against the dollar after a Yes vote.\n\nNomura, Japan's biggest bank, is urging some clients to pull money out of the UK ahead of the referendum. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, also warned that breaking up the UK would throw a newly independent Scotland \"into deep recession\".\n\nSources at RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, Scotland's two biggest banking institutions, disclosed that \"worried\" customers had expressed concerns about their finances ahead of the vote.\n\nAlistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign, said at least \u00a32.3\u2009 billion has been wiped off the value of big Scottish companies since the first opinion poll last week showing the referendum was in the balance. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, told The Telegraph: \"I think that the consequences of separation will be extremely damaging both for the rest of the UK and to Scotland. This isn't just fantasy.\n\n\"The evidence of what has happened over the past 24 hours is just a prelude to the sort of problems that will come if there's a decision to separate.\"\n\nMr Carney said an independent Scotland will not be able to keep the pound because it will be \"incompatible with sovereignty\".\n\nHis comments will come as a significant blow to Mr Salmond, who has insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to keep the pound.\n\nAll three main political parties have ruled out a currency union with an independent Scotland.\n\nOne senior Conservative MP last night warned that there will be an exodus of financial institutions from Scotland in the event of independence.\n\nThe MP said: \"Scotland will be plunged into an economic crisis within days of a Yes vote. The big financial and other institutions are not going to stay in Scotland.\n\n\"They are the companies who have not said anything because they have been bullied into silence. I don't think I've ever seen something quite so potentially catastrophic being sleep walked into.\"\n\nAhead of his visit to Scotland today, Mr Cameron said he cares \"passionately\" about Scotland remaining in the Union.\n\nMPs and Cabinet ministers have warned that the Prime Minister will face immediate calls to resign in the event of a Yes vote.\n\nDowning Street said he would use his visit to \"talk to Scottish voters\".\n\nMr Cameron said: \"In the end, it is for the Scottish people to decide, but I want them to know that the rest of the United Kingdom - and I speak as Prime Minister - want them to stay.\"\n\nMr Miliband has also faced criticism for Labour's \"lacklustre\" campaign in Scotland.\n\nHe said: \"I want the Scottish people to be in no doubt that the view, I believe from the whole of the UK, is that, yes, things need to change, but let's change this together by voting No in the referendum.\n\n\"Please stay with us so we can change Britain, we can change Scotland together.\"\n\nNick Clegg said that the devolution of powers to Holyrood will be an \"irreversible process\". He said Scotland would be given new powers over taxation, welfare and borrowing.\n\nMr Salmond yesterday claimed that the three party leaders are making the biggest \"blunder\" yet of the No campaign by making a last-minute trip to Scotland.\n\nHe said: \"Together, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are the most distrusted Westminster politicians ever - and their collective presence in Scotland will be another massive boost for the Yes campaign.\n\n\"In trust ratings, David Cameron is minus 50 in Scotland, Ed Miliband is minus 44 - and Nick Clegg is off the scale at minus 59. They are minus more than 150 together.\"\n\nThree opinion polls conducted over the past week show the 307-year-old Union between England and Scotland is hanging by a thread following a surge of support for the Yes campaign.\n\nOnly pensioners remain overwhelmingly in favour of a No vote. The turnaround was triggered by Mr Salmond's victory over Mr Darling in a BBC debate last month.\n\nSenior nationalist strategists are now convinced they have the momentum to carry them to victory on Thursday next week.\n\nHowever, while Better Together sources said they are relying on the offer of more powers and voters having second thoughts about the economic risks.",

                    "body": "BP says North Sea oil industry is 'best served' by Scotland remaining in UK\n\nBy Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline\n\nNo to independence leader Alistair Darling today accused his nationalist rival Alex Salmond of being 'despicable', 'mad' and focused on 'throwing stones' at the English.\n\nThe former Chancellor's blistering attacks came during an online question and answer session with Scottish mothers on the popular site Mumsnet.\n\nAs Standard Life and oil giant BP voiced fresh doubts about independence, Mr Darling said Mr Salmond's plan to use the pound without a formal currency deal with Westminster was 'mad' and would cost tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nIt came as David Cameron urged Scots not to use the referendum to give the 'effing Tories' a kicking, as Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg flew into Scotland to join the fight to preserve the Union.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nHe also accused the SNP of trying to frighten the sick and the elderly into voting for independence by raising bogus fears over the future of the NHS. He said this was 'despicable'.\n\nAnd he claimed Scotland got a 'very good deal' from being in the UK. He said the partnership between England and Scotland 'works well for both sides', adding: 'We should work with our neighbours not throw stones at them'.\n\nMr Darling's inflammatory comments risk fuelling accusations that the 'No' campaign was panicking amid a surge in support for independence.\n\nBut Mr Salmond said the Better Together leader of using 'scaremongering tactics'.\n\nHe added: 'It would be nice if you could bring yourself to accept, like even David Cameron has, that Scotland could be a prosperous and successful independent country.'\n\nMr Darling insisted he was not 'scaremongering' but simply pointing to the risks of separation.\n\nHe said there were at least three concrete reasons for staying in the UK. Mr Darling said: 'Standard Life, the Edinburgh pensions company, have said that if there is a \"Yes\" vote they are making plans right now to move business down south.\n\n'Another example - we spend \u00a31.200 more for every Scot on health, schools and other vital public services.\n\n'If we leave the UK, we lose that. It's not just me saying that - but independent experts. If I saw you step out in front of a bus and I shouted a warning, would that be scaremongering, would it?'\n\nMr Darling highlighted the announcement by Edinburgh-based pensions company Standard Life that it was 'planning for new companies in England to which they can transfer parts of their business' in the event of a 'No' vote.\n\nHe added: 'You might also want to have a look at what oil expert Sir Ian Wood has said today - that the nationalists have misled Scotland on oil.\n\n'Both BP and Shell said today it would be best to stay in the UK. This is not my verdict - it's employers. Why risk jobs with a Yes vote when real change is coming with a No vote.'\n\nMr Darling also returned to his warnings over the future of the pound in an independent Scotland.\n\nHe said: 'Of course Scotland can use the pound. We could also use the yen, the rouble or the dollar. The crucial point is that it would be somebody else's currency, leaving us with no control over interest rates.'\n\nMr Darling said: 'Crucially, Scotland would have no central bank. That would cost us tens of thousands of job in the financial services industry.'\n\nBut Mr Salmond dismissed the fears and claimed an independent Scotland would forge a currency union with the UK, keep the Queen, be allowed into the EU and Nato and not face any border controls with England.\n\nHe said: 'There really won't be border controls any more than there are right now with Ireland, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands as part of the Common Travel Area - that was just another of the scare stories the No Camp have run.'\n\nHe said independence would be declared on March 24, 2016.\n\nHe said: 'This will allow time for the preparations necessary for the Scottish Parliament to take on the new powers of independence.'\n\nMr Salmond said mortgage rates will continue to be based on the interest rate set by the Bank of England, which in a Sterling Area will be exactly the same for Scotland as for the rest of the UK, just as it is now'.\n\n'On the EU, you'll have noted that it's all gone quiet from the no campaign over the past few weeks, probably for the very obvious reason that the incoming President of the Commission has said that he will respect the referendum process of Scotland and the former President of the Parliament said in Edinburgh yesterday that 18 months was perfectly viable to negotiate Scotland's continuing membership of the EU - an international body founded on democratic values.\n\n'Finally, I thought the fact that the last UK Ambassador to NATO, Dame Mariot Leslie, who retired only this year has stated firmly that of course Scotland would be welcome in that organisation was a rather telling contribution - don't you?'\n\nThe economic impact of independence has been one of the strongest cards the No campaign has been able to play, with Mr Salmond refusing to say what currency Scotland would use if it leaves the UK.\n\nHe insists he would enter a currency union to continue using the pound - something Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems have all rejected.\n\nThe Scottish National Party has suggested that a currency deal would be a condition of Scotland accepting its share of the national debt.\n\nMr Salmond reportedly taunted the Westminster parties with a joke apparently suggesting he could default on Scotland's share of the UK's national debt if the pound was not shared.\n\nSources close to the Scottish leader told ITV News he had exclaimed: 'What are they going to do? Invade?'\n\nA spokesman for Mr Salmond later dismissed the claim as 'total nonsense' but it highlights the growing tensions over the central questions of the currency and debt.\n\nMr Salmond suffered a double blow from two of Scotland's biggest businesses.\n\nThe boss of oil giant BP warned that future long-term investments aimed at extending the life of existing assets in the North Sea and managing the future costs of decommissioning required 'fiscal stability and certainty'.\n\nBob Dudley, BP Group Chief executive, backed earlier comments from oil industry veteran Sir Ian Wood who said that Scottish people were being misled by forecasts of a new oil boom.\n\nMr Dudley said: 'BP has been in the UK North Sea for 50 years and we hope to operate here for many years to come. However, the province is now mature and I believe Sir Ian Wood correctly assesses its future potential.\n\n'The opportunities today are smaller and more challenging to develop than in the past. We also face the challenges of extending the productive life of existing assets and managing the future costs of decommissioning.\n\n'Much of this activity requires fiscal support to be economic, and future long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty.'\n\n'Our business invests for decades into the future. It is important our plans are based on a realistic view of the North Sea's future potential and the challenges the industry faces in continuing to operate here.\n\n'As a major investor in Scotland - now and into the future - BP believes that the future prospects for the North Sea are best served by maintaining the existing capacity and integrity of the United Kingdom.'\n\nPensions and savings giant Standard Life also revealed it is preparing to transfer parts of its business to England if Scotland votes in favour of independence.\n\nThe company, which has been based in Scotland for 189 years, said pensions, investments and other long-term savings held by UK consumers could be moved south of the Scottish border in order to 'help to ensure continuity and peace of mind'.\n\nIt said the precautionary plans are being put in place due to continued uncertainty over a range of key issues, including the currency that an independent Scotland would use, the approach to taxation and the arrangements for consumer protection in the event of a Yes vote.\n\nThe company's chief executive David Nish said: 'This transfer of our business could potentially include pensions, investments and other long-term savings held by UK customers.'\n\nThe firm said that if Scotland votes Yes, 'we understand it would be at least 18 months before Scotland could become a separate country from the United Kingdom'.\n\nWith panic growing in Westminster over a surge in support for independence, Mr Cameron, Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg have taken the extraordinary step of agreeing to abandon Prime Minister's Questions today.\n\nInstead, they are making unscheduled trips to Scotland to try to rally the faltering No campaign.\n\nLib Dem leader Mr Clegg joined Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael and local MP Michael Moore on the referendum campaign trail in Selkirk, in the Borders.\n\nHe denied claims that the pro-union parties' joint offer of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote was a 'last-minute' panic measure to shore up support for the union.\n\nSpeaking in the town's Market Square where he met local activists, Mr Clegg said: 'People say this is all last minute, (William) Gladstone was campaigning for home rule in the 1880s. This is something my party has been campaigning on for generations.\n\n'What's new, and that crystallised on August 5, was when the three main parties said we all now agree there is going to be irrevocable process of further significant and sweeping new devolution to Scotland - assuming that the people of Scotland decide that Scotland, as I fervently hope they will, remains part of the UK - in the very near future that will cover taxation, that will cover welfare and will cover borrowing, amongst other areas.\n\n'Whatever the result on the 18th, even if Scotland votes to remain part of the UK, let's be clear, the status quo has gone, not only for Scotland but for the whole of the UK.'\n\nLabour leader Mr Miliband said every shoulder must be to the wheel in the final days of 'the longest campaign in British political history'.\n\nThe Labour leader said the case for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum came from the 'head, heart and soul', as he set out the 'strong emotional and solidarity arguments for staying together'.\n\nAlistair Darling admitted he got 'het up' with his nationalist rival Alex Salmond today as the debate over independence turned nasty.\n\nThe former Chancellor is usually known for his dour, understated approach to politics but let his emotions show after being questioned by Scottish mothers.\n\nHere is how the row escalated:\n\nOne mother 'Mythreeknights' wrote a question to Mr Salmond: 'I just don't understand how you can feel confident leading this country if there is no guarantee that we can keep the pound, if you plan to default on national debt, and the majority of financial institutions insist there will be massive economic troubles ahead.\n\n'How can you be confident against such critical certainty from a number of economic experts? How can you reassure me that Scotland will not enter a long period of austerity and recession?'\n\nThe SNP leader replied: 'There are plenty of economic experts, including the economic Nobel laureates James Mirrlees and Joseph Stiglitz, who have backed that position but more importantly all the evidence is that a majority of the people of Scotland support that common sense view.\n\n'Alistair Darling's admission during the debate that \"of course we could keep the pound\" merely stated the obvious that you cannot be stopped by anyone from using an internationally tradeable currency but the agreement on a common currency would be best for everyone.'\n\nBut Mr Darling said: 'Oh dear. Of course Scotland can use the pound. Like Panama uses the dollar. We could also use the yen, the rouble or the dollar. The crucial point is that it would be somebody else's currency, leaving us with no control over interest rates.\n\n'Crucially, Scotland would have no central bank. That would cost us tens of thousands of job in the financial services industry. If this really is Alex's Plan B, it is mad.'\n\nA user called 'bananaboat' asked: 'Mr Salmond in the second debate you talked about a Tory-led plan to privatise the NHS in Scotland which has apparently chimed with voters and boost the Yes campaign's popularity.\n\n'But the NHS is wholly devolved in Scotland and the Tories have no influence in the Scottish Government. Can you explain?'\n\nMr Salmond responded: 'The difficulty is, while the administration of the NHS is fully devolved, the finance is dependent on decisions made at Westminster.\n\n'Privatisation and charging in the NHS south of the border will put great pressure on our public health service in Scotland unless we control both sides of the balance sheet and the finance as well as the administration of our public National Health Service.'\n\nBut Mr Darling said: 'The NHS is completely devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Prime Minister can't privatise it.\n\n'The First Minister could. Actually, he's spent more than a hundred million pounds on private provision in the last few years.\n\n'He might not mention that too often. What matters is that health care is free at the point of need.\n\n'Not only does the Scottish Parliament have complete control over health policy, but from 2016 it will have power to raise money to spend more on the health service, if it wants to do that.\n\n'In other words, you can have the changes we need to guarantee health spending under devolution, within the UK. You don't need to break up the country to do that.'\n\nHe then added: 'Sorry, got het up there and posted before I meant to. Frightening people on health, cancer patients, the elderly and vulnerable, is despicable.'\n\nA woman called 'Polonium' asked Mr Salmond if he would 'accept a No vote graciously'?\n\nShe said: 'Are you going to accept you were wrong, retire from politics and allow Scotland's fractured communities to heal themselves and live peacefully within the union?'\n\nShe also asked Mr Darling: 'Do you think it's fair that Scotland has more self determination, more rights AND enjoys the rights and responsibilities that come from being part of the union?'\n\nMr Darling responded: 'Thanks very much polonium. I agree - Scotland gets a very good deal from the union but we also give a lot back.\n\n'Scottish innovation, our shared history, all the economics that go with being a partner in a bigger UK, the partnership works for both sides.",

                    "body": "Alex Salmond in Edinburgh on Tuesday. Getty Images\n\nLINLITHGOW, Scotland -- Alex Salmond used to be seen by Britain's establishment as harmless, peddling a pipe-dream of ending Scotland's 300-year union with the United Kingdom.\n\nNow, the charismatic leader of the Scottish National Party is just days away from a historic referendum on Scottish independence that has raised the specter of a breakup and sent U.K. leaders on a last-minute dash to Scotland to bolster their case for union.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband and Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg -- in a rare show of unity -- announced they were clearing their schedules and traveling to Scotland on Wednesday to campaign against an independence referendum that has dramatically gained momentum in recent polls.\n\nRelated Vote Puts Strain on Businesses\n\nSix months ago, polls showed that the pro-U.K. vote was firmly in the lead for the Sept. 18 referendum. But the surveys show Mr. Salmond has narrowed the gap. A Tuesday survey by pollster TNS showed 39% of people saying they would vote \"no\" to independence, while 38% said they would vote \"yes.\" The remaining 23% were undecided. That followed a weekend poll that showed yes votes outnumbering the nos for the first time since the referendum campaign began.\n\nThe Yes Scotland campaign is spearheading the independence drive, while Better Together, backed by all three main political parties in London, is pushing to retain the union. Nationalists need a simple majority in the vote to end Scotland's more than 300-year-old union with England and Wales. The modern U.K. also includes Northern Ireland.\n\nHow the 59-year-old Mr. Salmond brought the U.K. to the cusp of breakup is testament to his formidable political skills and his ability to channel the cultural and societal shifts that underlie Scotland's independence movement.\n\nEven if Mr. Salmond's party loses the referendum, the semiautonomous government he leads in Edinburgh has already been promised a bounty of consolation prizes from the U.K.'s leaders in Westminster, in the form of significant new powers on economic and social issues, including income tax, transportation and housing subsidies for the poor.\n\nCritics and admirers alike describe Mr. Salmond as a gambler and an opportunist, adept at seizing every possible chance to advance his cause. When tennis star Andy Murray, a Scot, became the first British winner of Wimbledon after 77 years in 2013, Mr. Salmond, in the stands, unfurled the blue-and-white Scottish flag. Colleagues say he often quotes from the Duke of Montrose's poem \"I'll Never Love Thee More,\" which praises those who take risks \"to gain or lose it all.\"\n\nDespite his success, Mr. Salmond remains a polarizing figure, among both political obsessives and ordinary voters.\n\n\"I don't trust Salmond,\" said James Smyth, owner of a gallery on Edinburgh's Royal Mile, a stone's throw from Mr. Salmond's seat of power at the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood. \"He wants to be King of Scotland at any cost, and the cost is going to be bloody expensive.\"\n\nFor Mr. Salmond's biggest gamble so far -- that Scotland could thrive economically outside the U.K. -- the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\nScotland's departure would have profound repercussions for Britain's political landscape and its economy, the third largest in Europe. Scotland contributes about \u00a3148 billion, or 9.2%, to the U.K. GDP. The potential loss of billions of pounds a year in oil and gas revenues from the North Sea could blow a hole in London's efforts to balance the books after a painful recession. Oil and gas tax receipts peaked in 2009 at \u00a312.3 billion but are now less than half that. One of the key unknowns weighing on the vote is how the U.K.'s oil and gas assets would be split after a secession.\n\nA vote in favor of independence could spook foreign investors -- the recent polls have already hit the pound and U.K. stocks and bonds. Depositors fearful for their savings in Scottish banks could pull their money out, destabilizing the financial system. Economists say the U.K. economy, growing quickly but still fragile after a global recession in 2009, could sputter as households and businesses stop to take stock of what Scottish independence might mean for them.\n\nAnd Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney on Tuesday warned Scots that a currency union with the rest of the U.K. would be \"incompatible with sovereignty\" if they chose to secede.\n\nWhile a Scottish secession would be a humiliating blow to Mr. Cameron and his Conservative Party, the opposition Labour Party, which relies heavily on Scottish votes for its success, could also face new headwinds.\n\nEven the Union Jack -- an echo of Britain's imperial past recognized across the globe -- might need a redesign; its blue and white background represents the Scottish flag, the Saltire.\n\nFor tiny Scotland itself, cut adrift in an unsettled global economy and reliant for cash on sometimes-volatile oil revenues, the stakes could be higher still.\n\nAn independent Scotland would have to renegotiate its membership in the European Union. Independence leaders say it would join in 18 months, but former and current EU officials have said it could take significantly longer and added that a member must have an independent currency, dismissing Scotland's plans to continue using Britain's pound.\n\nAn independent Scotland would also face potentially significant startup costs, such as establishing its own military.\n\nBut the payout could also be high, nationalists say, with Edinburgh gaining full control of tax revenue raised within its borders and able to prioritize whatever spending its citizens want. Currently, the Scottish Parliament can direct about 60% of the budget spent in Scotland.\n\nUnionists say independence is too risky; nationalists counter the real risk to Scots' prosperity is staying yoked to a distant and uncaring London that pushes through spending cuts and other policies Scots don't support.\n\n\"Independence will allow the people of Scotland to work together, to transform Scotland for the better,\" Mr. Salmond said in a recent speech. \"It means that we will always get the governments we vote for. We will gain the powers we need to promote productivity, jobs and investment. We will be able to build a more prosperous country and a fairer society.\" Mr. Salmond declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nAfter centuries of on-off antagonism, Scotland joined with England and Wales in 1707, creating Great Britain.\n\nIndustrial revolution, imperial adventurism and two world wars brought the nations closer together. But Scottish nationalism endured, just as Scots preserved the Gaelic language, their own church and other institutions, and their own legal system.\n\nMistrust of their English neighbors -- built on centuries of friction and outright conflict -- lingered, too. To many nationalists, those Scots who agreed to the 1707 union were turncoats who betrayed their nation \"for English gold,\" according to the 18th-century poet Robert Burns. English historians tend to the view the Scots were broke and England stepped in to bail them out.\n\nScots' desire for self-government has been a feature of British political life for generations. Scottish Labour leader Keir Hardie campaigned for \"Home Rule\" during Britain's imperial heyday in the years leading up to World War I. Mr. Salmond's Scottish National Party was formed in 1934 and since the 1960s has sent lawmakers to parliament in London.\n\nEnlarge Image Close\n\nIn recent decades, Scotland moved decisively toward the political left, a legacy of economic reforms enacted by successive Conservative governments during the 1980s and 1990s that accelerated the demise of Britain's industrial heartlands -- many in Scotland.\n\nScottish Nationalists, meanwhile, proved adept at wooing left-wing Labour voters who loathe the Conservatives and were disenchanted with their party's 1990s shift to the right.\n\nThe discovery of oil off the Scottish coast in the North Sea in the 1960s fueled many Scots' sense they were getting a raw deal from the union.\n\nMr. Salmond's fervor for the cause of Scottish independence came from his grandfather, who used to tell the future leader colorful Scottish historical tales while balancing him on one knee, according to a recent biography.\n\nPeter Brunskill, who was best friends with Mr. Salmond at the University of St. Andrews on Scotland's windswept eastern coast 40 years ago, recalls going door-to-door with the young Mr. Salmond, canvassing for independence, even in the bitter cold of mid-November.\n\n\"He found it difficult to understand why you wouldn't want to spend 24/7 campaigning for independence -- what else was there?\" Mr. Brunskill said.\n\nMr. Salmond joined the SNP as a student in the 1970s and, after a career as an economist, was first elected as a member of the U.K. parliament at Westminster in 1987, representing Banff and Buchan, a constituency on Scotland's northeastern coast.\n\nAt the time, the SNP was a tiny party on the fringes of Westminster political life. Mr. Salmond was one of only three SNP lawmakers among the House of Commons' 650. His first speech as a member of parliament touched on themes he would return to again and again during his career. He poked fun at the feeble performance in Scotland of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in the 1987 election, even though she won overall. He criticized the government for its neglect of rural constituencies such as his own, where people farmed, fished and worked in the oil industry, or where they \"work with their hands and get their faces dirty,\" as he described it. He accused London of squandering Scotland's oil revenues and declared that Scotland was a nation with the right \"to determine its own political destiny.\" His words struck home in a country that was grappling with industrial decline and frustration with policies made in London.\n\nMr. Salmond became leader of the SNP in 1990. It was Mr. Salmond's indefatigable, media-friendly persona that kept the SNP from slipping into total obscurity. Over the years he wrote a column in The Scotsman newspaper about horse racing and popped up as a genial guest on television game shows. In his hometown of Linlithgow, he used to spend Saturdays betting on horse racing at the local betting shop, said Paul Watson, a regular there.\n\nThe SNP's fortunes changed in 1997. Resentment with Westminster had intensified in Scotland during the 1990s following a decade of Conservative governments' market-oriented economic programs. Demands for greater autonomy grew. The Scottish Parliament, which had been dissolved in 1707, was reconvened in 1999 after Scots in a referendum took up Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's offer of devolution.\n\nMr. Blair's offer had been intended to shore up his party's support and banish \"the threat of separatism,\" according to Labour's 1997 manifesto. Instead, devolution transformed the SNP's fortunes.\n\nIn the Scottish Parliament, which currently has control over policies in areas including health, education and transport, the SNP won enough seats to make them the second-largest party after Labour in 1999. But they struggled to make further gains until Mr. Salmond, who had stood down as leader in 2000, returned for a second term in 2004. He spent the intervening years as the SNP's top lawmaker in the U.K. Parliament -- which makes foreign and defense policy for the U.K. and controls most taxes and welfare spending -- where he stood out as a vocal critic of the Iraq war.\n\nMr. Salmond led the SNP to victory in Scotland in 2007. A second, stunning win followed in 2011 that gave Mr. Salmond an outright majority in Holyrood. He almost immediately announced plans for a referendum on independence.\n\nPolitical analysts say Mr. Salmond's electoral success in 2011 owed much to his party's record in government. Polls showed SNP ministers -- most of whom weren't career politicians but had instead held down regular jobs or built businesses -- were viewed as effective administrators and many of their policies, such as free prescriptions for medicines, were popular.\n\nThat fueled support for a greater transfer of power from London that Mr. Salmond has adroitly channeled toward enthusiasm for independence.\n\nThe Scottish national flag flies above the London residence of the British prime minister, with the Union flag flying next door above the residence of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer on Tuesday. European Pressphoto Agency\n\nBy the time of its 2011 victory, the SNP had established a formidable electioneering machine, which has now been pressed into service for the pro-independence \"yes\" campaign. Officials say a vast database constantly fed by an army of activists allowed SNP strategists to tailor election messages to individual voters' concerns.\n\nIn Linlithgow, 20 miles from Edinburgh, one of Mr. Salmond's former neighbors and childhood playmates, Robert Cruickshank, said the SNP leader is a rare politician who genuinely cares about the people and his goals. Old classmates and political sparring partners described a man passionate about politics, but one unwilling to hear other people's views.\n\n\"He's happy to engage, but not happy to listen,\" said Iain McGill, a Conservative parliamentary candidate for Edinburgh central. At an event late last year for business leaders in Edinburgh, he talked but didn't take on board questions and criticism, Mr. McGill said.\n\nMargaret Henderson, an Elder at St. Michael's Parish Church who was a few years ahead of Mr. Salmond at school, said he was confident and bright, but didn't always listen to other's opinions.\n\n\"He would just override people and speak over them,\" Ms. Henderson said. \"That was typically Alex.\"\n\nMr. Salmond sometimes displays a tendency to overreach and seemingly ignores inconvenient obstacles. When he played arcade games with his college friends, they called one of his tactics the Salmond Bum-Up, a reference to his propensity to tilt the machine seeking an advantage. He still falls victim to that impulse in today's referendum campaign. In October 2012, the SNP was accused of misleading voters by saying Scotland would be an automatic member of the EU. His assurances that Scotland will keep using the pound if they vote to secede have been challenged by all three Westminster political parties, who say voters won't want a eurozone-style currency union with their new northern neighbor.\n\nNor do his bets always pay off. Perhaps his biggest misstep came in 2009, when his government released Lockerbie jetliner bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, provoking an international outcry. The Scottish government said it followed due process and released al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds due to illness.\n\nAs Scots get ready to vote, doubts have persisted over whether Mr. Salmond can deliver the prosperity he promises. Economists have poked at his economic arguments, saying his forecasts for oil revenue and future productivity are wildly optimistic. Negotiations over unresolved issues such as currency and divvying up the U.K.'s debts could be difficult.\n\nYet support for independence still climbs, even though some polls show most voters don't trust him and few think they will be better off if Scotland secedes.\n\nPolls had suggested he would lose the 2011 election. Instead Mr. Salmond won an unprecedented majority in Edinburgh, a last-minute victory that unnerves his opponents. \"Alex Salmond tends to finish well in races,\" said Anthony Wells, associate director of pollster YouGov.\n\nFirst Minister Alex Salmond, center, poses with pro-independence supporters Tuesday in Edinburgh . For Mr. Salmond's biggest gamble so far -- that Scotland could thrive economically outside the U.K. -- the stakes couldn't be higher.

Reuters\n\nLONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron and his two main U.K. political rivals are canceling their schedules for Wednesday to campaign in Scotland against independence, in a united front that shows the alarm in the capital over a prospect that once seemed unlikely.\n\nIn the face of polls showing growing support among Scots for leaving the union, the three leaders were taking the rare move of skipping a weekly question-and-answer session in Parliament to meet with Scottish voters instead.\n\nRelated Coverage BOE's Carney Warns Scots Over Sterling Five Things to Consider Ahead of Vote Pound Steadies at 10-Month Low (9/9/14) U.K. Financial Regulator Making Plans for 'Yes' Vote (9/9/14) U.K. Vows New Powers for Scotland (9/7/14) Market Talk\n\nMore Powers for Scotland, Whatever Whatever the result of the upcoming referendum, Scotland can expect to have more policymaking powers after the vote, but according to George Buckley at Deutsche Bank, \"the two alternative routes by which it can achieve this are monumentally different.\" In the event of a 'No' vote, the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will push for, and likely receive, increased devolution from Westminster ahead of the U.K. general election next year. In the event of a 'Yes' vote, he expects to see a notable fall in the currency, lower equity prices and possibly higher gilt yields. \"In terms of monetary policy, markets may price in the Bank of England on hold for longer with a 'Yes' vote generating risks to the sustainability of the recovery.\" (chiara.albanese@wsj.com @chiaraalbanese)\n\nUBS Deems Sterling Reaction \"Knee-Jerk\" and Excessive Geoffrey Yu, a currency strategist at UBS said sterling's stark adjustment following the most recent Scottish referendum polls is excessive. \"The sudden convergence in the Yes and No camps on Scottish independence measured by polling data has led to sharp moves in both spot and options markets but we believe this is largely being dominated by knee-jerk emotional reactions rather than psephological analysis (the study of opinion polling),\" he said. \"The risk of a United Kingdom break-up has moved from trivial to non-trivial, but no more.\" he added. Sterling has fallen 6% against the dollar since its high in July. At 1410 GMT Tuesday, however, it is flat. (josie.cox@wsj.com)\n\nMarket Talk is a stream of real-time news and market analysis that's available on Dow Jones Newswires\n\nMr. Cameron said the rival leaders would campaign separately but are united in their desire to keep the U.K. together. \"One thing I am sure we will all say is it is a matter for people in Scotland to decide, but we want you to stay,\" he told the British Broadcasting Corp. on Tuesday.\n\nIn a further sign of how seriously Britain's leaders view the consequences of a split, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney on Tuesday warned Scots that a currency union with the rest of the U.K. would be \"incompatible with sovereignty\" if they choose to secede. Mr. Carney's comments reiterate an argument he set out in detail in a January speech: that successful currency unions require shared institutions and a willingness for member states to surrender a degree of sovereignty.\n\nAlex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, has insisted an independent Scotland would keep the pound and enter a new sterling union with the U.K.\n\nWith just more than a week until the Sept. 18 vote, the parties are promising Scottish voters they will devolve powers to Scotland -- and assure them it will happen quickly -- after the latest polls showed the campaigns in the independence fight are running neck-and-neck.\n\nA Tuesday survey by pollster TNS showed that 39% said they would vote \"no\" to independence, while 38% said they would vote \"yes,\" with a margin of error of 4 %. The rest of the 990 people sampled were undecided. That followed a weekend poll that showed Scottish support for leaving the 300-year union edging ahead of staying in the U.K.\n\nThough they disagree on some of the specifics, the three major national parties all say that Scotland would be better off if it didn't leave the union. Mr. Cameron, opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband and Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg made the decision Monday not to appear at Prime Minister's Questions so that they could go to Scotland, Mr. Cameron's spokesman said.\n\nMr. Cameron called for the Scottish flag to fly at 10 Downing Street, his official residence and office until the day of the referendum. Mr. Miliband also urged cities, towns and villages across the country to fly the Saltire to show support for keeping Scotland in the U.K.\n\nThe Scottish flag, left, flutters on the Cunard Building in Liverpool, England, on Tuesday, after Labour Party leader Ed Miliband urged cities, towns and villages across the U.K. to display the Saltire in a sign of commitment to the union ahead of Scotland's independence referendum. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nThe announcement comes as local Scottish leaders of the three parties pledged to support new powers that include authority over economic and social issues, including income tax, transportation and housing subsidies for the poor.\n\nThey backed former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a Labour politician who said in a speech Monday that work on devolving authority to Scotland would begin the day after the independence referendum. He also laid out a high-speed timetable for enacting legislation that would give Scotland more powers within months.\n\nMr. Brown, who is from Scotland, has become a prominent voice of London's political establishment because of the unpopularity of the governing Conservatives in Scotland, where many voters lean left.\n\n\"This package of changes will mean the Scottish Parliament has much greater scope -- if that's what the Scottish people want -- to secure a fairer society in Scotland, while still being able to rely lie on the wider social solidarity of the U.K.,\" Mr. Brown, who is Scottish, said in the speech in Loanhead, Scotland.\n\nSome voters say the last-minute flurry of promises and attention from the parties -- which come after some voters have already cast their votes by mail -- is too late.\n\nEddy Cornock, a 65-year-old retired teacher living in Linlithgow, Scotland, dismissed the U.K. government efforts as empty promises.\n\n\"This is a total reaction -- a panicked reaction -- to the polls,\" said Mr. Cornock, who plans to vote for independence. He said he's certain that if there is a \"no\" vote, London politicians will backtrack. \"It'll go down on the priority list.\"\n\nU.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured, opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband and Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg will travel to Scotland to campaign for Scotland to stay in the U.K. European Pressphoto Agency\n\nMr. Salmond on Tuesday dismissed London's offer of extra devolution as a \"weak\" and \"insipid\" rehash of past promises that the Scottish electorate have already rejected. \"This is the day the 'No' campaign finally falls apart at the seams,\" he told the BBC.\n\nLeaders in Scotland's semiautonomous Parliament in Edinburgh currently have control over policies in areas including health, education and transport. They also have limited tax-raising powers. The U.K. Parliament at Westminster determines foreign and defense policy for the U.K. and have control of most taxes as well as welfare spending.\n\nMatthew Goodwin, associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, said the last-minute pledges by party leaders could make undecided voters see the pro-union campaign as panicking.\n\n\"Historians will probably look back and judge this as an example of poor leadership from leaders in Westminster who should really have prepared for this outcome far better than they have done,\" Mr. Goodwin said. \"There are some who argue that the campaign has become rather desperate.\"\n\nWrite to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com, Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com and Nicholas Winning at nick.winning@wsj.com",

However, an attempt to fly the Scottish flag over Downing Street backfired when it fell off the flagpole.\n\n-\u2009Mr Salmond, the First Minister, indicated that the Queen was at ease with the prospect of Scottish independence after she faced calls from MPs to speak out ahead of the referendum.\n\n-\u2009The main Westminster parties united behind plans for a \"home rule\" Bill to give the Scottish government more powers in the event of a No vote.\n\n-\u2009Mr Salmond was reported to have said, \"What are they going to do - invade?\" when asked about his threat to default on Scotland's share of the national debt.\n\nIn a newspaper article, Mr Cameron said that it is only by remaining a united country that \"we can keep on building a better future for our children\".\n\nCelebrating the UK and the shared history of its individual nations, he said: \"This is the group of small islands in the North Atlantic that have punched above our weight for centuries -- and we've done so together.\n\n\"When the world wanted representation, we gave them democracy. When they wanted progress, we had the Scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution. When slavery bound innocent people, we abolished it. When fascism threatened freedom, we defeated it.\n\n\"A hundred years ago, our boys went off to war together -- and they did so as comrades, united by purpose and hope for a better world.\n\n\"As individuals and as nations, we have done extraordinary things. This is the special alchemy of the UK - you mix together Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland and together we smash expectations.\"\n\nMr Cameron warned voters in Scotland that there \"will be no second chances\" if they vote for independence.\n\n\"Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together.\n\n\"If we pull together, we can keep on building a better future for our children. We can make sure our destiny matches our history, because there really will be no second chances. If the UK breaks apart, it breaks apart forever,\" Mr Cameron said in the article for the Daily Mail.\n\nMr Cameron is under huge pressure to reverse the poll results with only days until the independence vote on Sept 18.\n\nIn what was seen as a major risk, Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg cancelled today's session of Prime Minister's Questions and instead pledged to visit Scotland to \"listen and talk to voters\".\n\nIn an unprecedented joint statement, the three party leaders said that \"the right place for us to be ... is in Scotland, not at Prime Minister's Questions in Westminster\".\n\nTheir visit is designed to show their commitment to deliver on a promise to hand much greater powers to the Scottish government.\n\nHowever, it fuelled accusations that the three leaders are panicking. Conversely, Downing Street has also been accused by MPs of \"thinking the fight was won\" and failing to properly argue the case for the union.\n\nMPs and Cabinet ministers have warned that Mr Cameron will face calls to resign if Scotland votes yes.\n\nMr Cameron also warned that Mr Salmond had only offered \"question marks\" and he said Scotland had a \"brighter future\" in the union.\n\nAddressing voters in Scotland, the Prime Minister said: \"So the choice for you is clear: a leap into the dark with a Yes vote, or a brighter future for Scotland by voting No.\n\n\"You can have the best of both worlds in the UK. You can have more powers in Scotland. And you can be part of a United Kingdom - standing tall, forging a more secure future in this world, building more opportunities for our children and grandchildren and the generations yet to be born.\"\n\nThe value of sterling has fallen sharply in recent days after polls showed that Scotland could be heading towards independence. Figures released by Societe Generale, the French investment bank, showed an exodus of global money from British companies.\n\nThe bank predicted sterling could drop as much as 5 per cent against the dollar after a yes vote.\n\nNomura, Japan's biggest bank, is urging some clients to pull money out of the UK ahead of the referendum. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, also warned that breaking up the UK would throw a newly independent Scotland \"into deep recession\".\n\nSources at RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, Scotland's two biggest banking institutions, disclosed that \"worried\" customers had expressed concerns about their finances ahead of the vote.\n\nAlistair Darling, the leader of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said at least \u00a32.3\u2009billion had been wiped off the value of big Scottish companies since the first opinion poll last week showing the referendum was in the balance.\n\nDominic Grieve, the former attorney general, said: \"I think that the consequences of separation will be extremely damaging both for the rest of the UK and to Scotland. This isn't just fantasy.\"\n\nMr Salmond claimed that the three party leaders were making the biggest \"blunder\" yet of the No campaign by making a last-minute trip to Scotland.\n\nHe said: \"Together, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are the most distrusted Westminster politicians ever -- and their collective presence in Scotland will be another massive boost for the Yes campaign.\"",

And many are preparing to vote down independence in a bloodless anti-Bannockburn some 700 years on from Robert the Bruce's violent battle against London rule.\n\nPolls have showed a narrowing of the gap between yes and no voters ahead of the referendum on 18 September. Two of the most recent from pollsters YouGov and TNS show a hair's breadth between yes and no voters. But in the latter, 19% of more than 2,000 respondents said they don't know how they'll vote.\n\nSo the 8.5%, a hushed English sleeper cell veiled in the foggy dew of Scotland's glens, could make all the difference in how the vote goes and if Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and a political Bruce for our times, wins his battle with Westminster.\n\n\"Independence is just to satisfy a minor number of Braveheart wanters,\" says Professor Lee Cronin, the Regius Chair of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow and a son of Ipswich, England.\n\n\"I do not think I would be able to stay in Scotland if it became independent,\" he adds, citing what the nation would lose - his \u00a325m research group which includes 60 people, three spin-out companies and over 150 international collaborations.\n\n\"As soon as paralysis set in because of the negotiations that would occur, it would affect my research effort critically. I'm in my forties now. I don't have that many productive years left of thinking and running operational science, and to lose two or three years because the Scots are negotiating with the English seems a very dangerous state of affairs. And I'm not the only one thinking this.\"\n\nBest of both worlds\n\nIt's difficult to get English-born Scots to admit they're voting against independence. Yet they're everywhere. Business people, military staff, students, the retired. Some don't want to risk alienating friends, others are concerned about the impact on their businesses. It's far easier for the pro-independence English to speak openly; a quick search on Twitter will spring up dozens of heartfelt, rousing and sometimes rambling posts.\n\nOthers may have been put off by a backlash against Harry Potter author JK Rowling, an English woman who has lived in Scotland for more than 20 years, after she said she would be voting against independence.\n\nShe was lashed by vitriolic tongues. A nasty section of the pro-independence movement called Rowling a \"traitor\" among other - and much worse - names. A few suggested she was being disloyal to Scotland after it supported her as a single mother before she made millions by writing the Harry Potter series.\n\nDespite the general silence of English Scots who don't want independence, some don't mind raising the Union Jack and defending an arrangement that has lasted more than 300 years. In fact, some are even willing to hit the pavements and knock on doors.\n\nKatie Dearden is a campaigner for Better Together(KD)\n\nKatie Dearden was born and bred in West Yorkshire and is about to enter her third year of studying for an international relations degree at the University of Edinburgh. She \"fell in love\" with Scotland when visiting as a child and decided to study there. Now she hopes to stay.\n\nDearden is also a campaigner for Better Together, which is pushing for a no vote in the referendum. If it turns out to be a yes instead, she's not sure if she'll stay in Scotland and it's \"something that I don't like to think about\".\n\n\"I really do think Scotland has the best of both worlds with its own Scottish parliament and the backing of the UK. I think that's fantastic and I'm a massive fan of devolution,\" she told IBTimes UK.\n\n\"As a United Kingdom, we're great on the world stage. In the UN, the EU, G20, G6 - so many different organisations that we have a great impact with. And to jeopardise that in any way doesn't make sense.\n\n\"I can't see why, in this day and age, any country would want to separate and close itself from that. The world is ever increasing and growing and uniting together.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary risk, especially with the EU. It's not guaranteed that Scotland will be part of the EU. Automatically assuming that... Scotland would have a more important voice or maybe a better voice, as Alex Salmond sometimes implies, is a bit naive to me.\"\n\nWhat independence means\n\nThe fundamental question of independence is clear. But the reality of what that independence will look like is as muddy as a peat bog. There are many questions left unanswered by the pro-independence campaign. These are vital questions, such as what would the currency be? What would the business and financial regulation systems look like? Would Scotland join the European Union? Will it be an open border?\n\nSalmond and his team have been criticised for not spelling out in detail what form of independence people are voting for and for making promises - such as that they will join the EU and keep sterling - that they cannot definitely keep. The vagueness has been seized upon by Better Together, who is urging Scotland to vote for the certainty of the UK over the uncertainty of going it alone.\n\nSome of these questions will trouble the English in particular, who may have family below Hadrian's Wall, or who own firms working either side of it. There is the potential for another labyrinthine layer of state bureaucracy between their blood and businesses. Regulation, border controls, taxes - or maybe none at all. But why take the risk of barrier-building by voting for independence?\n\n\"The argument [for independence] is not logically consistent,\" says Cronin, who emphasised that he's speaking as an individual and not on behalf of the University of Glasgow, which has kept a neutral stance.\n\nScottish National Party's Alex Salmond wants to retain the pound(Reuters)\n\nHe argued that retaining the pound, as Salmond wants, necessitates giving away sovereignty to the Bank of England and so, by proxy, Westminster. And there is no legal precedent that means Scotland would be guaranteed to keep it. This may lead to a new currency for Scotland and, in all likelihood, much higher borrowing costs for its government.\n\nMoreover, Cronin says he is \"not just a UK unionist, I'm a unionist in general\".\n\n\"I think the European Union is a very good thing and it doesn't make any sense to split one union and say 'we're pro-Europe'. Well if they're pro-Europe then for the very same reasons they must be pro-UK,\" he said.\n\nAnd Cronin is also concerned about what independence means for academia. Much of his research funding as a scientist comes from the UK and EU. He says it's not been made clear to him how independence would affect his academic funding.\n\nMore broadly, he thinks it will have a negative effect on scientific research in Scotland's world-leading universities. There would be a smaller pool of funding and less competition for it in a diminished system.\n\n\"It's like playing sport. If you don't have any other people to compete against then you're not going to get any better,\" he said.\n\nPolitical barrier\n\nLincolnshire-born Daniel Swain is a member of the Labour party and an economics graduate from the University of Edinburgh, where he wrote a dissertation on the effects of the size of a nation's market on its exports. He looked at Scotch whisky as a case study.\n\n\"A lot of the nationalist arguments based around trade and economics are that if the Scottish government was independent it would be able to market Scotland's goods better and Scotland would be able to export more,\" said Swain, who will vote no in the referendum.\n\n\"But actually, the Scottish government already does that - probably better than most national governments are able to because it has the benefits of the UK trade office as well.\n\n\"And then also the key in determining the export of industries is the size of the national market. So Scottish export markets, including Scotch whisky, benefit from having a big national market as opposed to a small one.\"\n\nSwain is unconvinced by the economic case for independence, which relies in large part on the North Sea oil and gas fields, where production is forecast to fall sharply over the coming decades.\n\nHe thinks Scotland must retain its influence on Westminster politics by being able to send MPs down to London, a global centre of capital, trade and commerce where big economic decisions are made.\n\n\"If Scotland put up a political barrier, it's not going to be beneficial to the people of Scotland because I think they're going to need to be able to affect decisions at that level,\" he said.\n\nLee Cronin isn't sure he could stay in Scotland if it became independent(University of Glasgow)\n\nPro-independence campaigners say an independent Scotland could make itself more competitive. It could make its own taxation regime, they say, develop new industries, create a sovereign wealth fund from North Sea revenues - carve out a new model economy.\n\nBut Cronin fears more bureaucracy and less competitiveness would be the consequence of independence.\n\n\"Basically we're going to have another administration layer added on, which is great for the politicians who want power. But I don't want them to have power,\" he said.\n\n\"I want power. I want power as a voter to basically get on with things. I demand better value for my money.\n\n\"I demand to see Scotland stop using the wrangles with the English for incompetence and to start using their incredible abilities - the prospects, the tourism sector, the education sector - to build and advance and compete. We're not doing that and it's a sorry state of affairs.\n\n\"This has always been my problem with Scotland. I've been here for well over 12 years. I don't see who is making any money. There seems to be an ever-decreasing number of people making things, manufacturing things, coming up with ideas, and a massive, massive taxpayer-funded set of administrators generating more nonsense for me to deal with. And that is a really, really dangerous set of affairs.\n\n\"I want the Scottish economy to be more agile, to be more responsive and to use devolution to do that. But they haven't. They've used it to create a set of administrative fiefdoms that serve themselves. And when the administrators serve themselves, very little gets done.\"\n\nAnglophobia\n\nIt's not a significant problem, but anti-English sentiment exists in Scotland and as the independence debate fires up, sparks of prejudice fly out.\n\nIn the run-up to the referendum, the number of white English people reporting racist incidents against them to Scottish police jumped by 80% to 146 in 2012/13. This accounted for 5% of all reported racist incidents in Scotland over the year.\n\nSwain said he's had people say things to him because he's English.\n\n\"I remember one old man saying he was voting 'yes' to get rid of all the English people. It's not a particularly prominent problem, but you get it now and again,\" he said. \"A lot of people when they're asked will say: 'I'm not anti-English, I'm anti-English government.' I'm not sure how sincere that is.\"\n\nDearden, on the other hand, said she's had a decent experience when hitting the streets to campaign against independence.\n\n\"Most of the time it's been really positive. I have heard that some people don't get as good an experience occasionally,\" she said.\n\n\"But the people I've spoken to aren't anti-English, they're just quite disillusioned with politics and they're looking for a way out. In no way have there been any aggressive, divisive comments about English people. It's just been positive really.\"\n\nCronin described the Scottish as \"very open-minded\" and said it is a \"very friendly country\".\n\n\"I've had banter with people and I know there are people who feel passionately about what Margaret Thatcher did to Scotland and all this, that and the other. And I think they misunderstand what actually occurred and how politics works,\" he said.\n\n\"There is a slight parochialism that is here but I haven't experienced any negativity on my part.\"\n\nIdentity question?\n\nSome attack any focus on national identity in the independence referendum debate. In fact, they reject entirely that the debate is at all about identity. To them it is about economics and political control, a move away from Tory domination and towards self-governance by the people living in Scotland.\n\nSo even asking the question of how the English-born will vote is to misread what is happening on the ground. This is no Braveheart clich\u00e9 or tartan revolution. It's about the localisation of political power and decision-making.\n\nMel Gibson as William Wallace in the film Braveheart.(Creative Commons)\n\nBut the very idea of splitting from the UK seems to be centred on nationhood; that going it alone allows Scotland the chance to create its own financial and economic values, principles and rules defined by the unique political culture in Scotland.\n\nThey see it as a move towards communitarian, socially conscious politics, the antithesis of the perception of Westminster as a hive of market-loving neo-liberal individualism. Then again, this is hardly unique to Scotland.\n\n\"The same aspirations for reform are held up and down the UK, there's nothing unique about the views of yes voters in Scotland, we're just lucky enough to have been handed a shot at political reform on a plate, and realise that the chance may not come again in our lifetimes,\" said one Reddit user discussing the issue.\n\n\"If there was a perception that UK politics was capable of genuine, significant reform, I've no doubt that many yes voters, me included, would be voting no.\n\n\"When you talk of 'defining Scottish society differently', I'd argue that most would rather achieve these same objectives within the framework of the UK, than out with it. We just don't believe that staying in the UK offers, or will ever offer, that opportunity.\"\n\nCameron's legacy\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time the English have done it to themselves over Scotland. When Edward II lost at Bannockburn, he had only managed to muster half of the army he wanted. Some of his best English knights hadn't turned up to fight alongside their king in what was a humiliating defeat for him.\n\nFrom students, to military personnel, to business people, and more - there are hundreds of thousands of English Scots living and voting above the border.\n\nIt would be just as painful for Cameron if a hallmark of his prime ministership was the secession of Scotland. But if most of the army of English voters living in Scotland turn up, it will probably be enough to help him deliver a fatal blow to Salmond's battle for independence.\n\nRelatedScottish Independence: Nationalist Freakonomics Could Haunt Scotland for Years to ComeScottish Independence: Alex Salmond Goes on the Offensive as 'No' Campaign Reverts to Negative TypeScottish Independence: Treasury Committee Warns of Higher Taxes and Borrowing RestrictionsScottish Independence: RBS and Lloyds Shares Jump on Relocation PledgeScottish Independence: SNP Claims Scotland Will Have Automatic EU MembershipPolitical Leaders Hit Panic Button and Head to Scotland to Stop Salmond Bandwagon",

                    "body": "The SNP's surprise win - no party had previously won a majority at the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh since Scots voted to set it up in 1997 - gave it, as first minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond put it, the \"moral authority\" to deliver a referendum on full independence. At the time, prime minister David Cameron said: \"If they want to hold a referendum I will campaign to keep our United Kingdom together with every single fibre I have.\"\n\nThe date was set for 18 September 2014, with four million voters - which for the first time will include 16- and 17-year-olds - to be asked a single question: \"Should Scotland become an independent country?\"\n\nAt that time, opinion polls put backing for independence at between 25% and 35%. This week's polls put the Yes and No campaigns neck and neck, with one placing the pro-independence side narrowly ahead. So what changed?\n\nEven after the Act of Union of 1707, Scotland continued to do many things differently from the rest of Britain. It maintained its own separate education system, law and justice systems, church and sports teams. But until the vote to set up a devolved government for Scotland in 1997, all major decisions were made in by the Westminster parliament in London. A referendum in 1979 on a devolved Scottish assembly garnered 51.6% of votes in favour, but the vote was defeated on a technicality: the the low turnout meant those voting in favour constituted only 32.9% of the electorate, below the 40% needed. Many Yes supporters felt cheated. (There is no turnout requirement this time.)\n\nVoters in Scotland tend to eschew rightwing parties: there is only one Scottish Conservative in the current Westminster parliament. This imbalance became particularly acute with a run of Conservative governments in the late 20th century, particularly that of Margaret Thatcher, which determined policy from (and, some critics levelled, for) England. Thatcher's decision to trial a deeply unpopular poll tax in Scotland led to riots and - in 2006 - an apology from one of her successors as Tory leader, David Cameron.\n\nThe election of Tony Blair's New Labour party in 1997 sparked change. A referendum for devolution was won in September of that year, with the prime minister confidently predicting the result would cement the union, not encourage further cracks. But calls for more powers have grown and following an electoral wipeout for the centrist Liberal Democrats in Scotland's 2011 parliamentary elections - casualties of their unpopular coalition with the Conservatives in Westminster - the stage was set for an SNP government committed to a referendum on a decisive break with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe lead campaigners for independence are the SNP, with its charismatic leader Alex Salmond and his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, the most recognisable faces for many voters. The Scottish Green party, a smaller group that has two representatives in the Holyrood parliament, also backs Yes. But the striking thing about the pro-independence campaign has been that so much of it has been taking place outside the normal political sphere.\n\nAs the Guardian's Libby Brooks reported earlier this year:\n\nThis is Scotland in the early summer of 2014. It is not a foreign country. The people who live here are not automatically more egalitarian or servile, no more optimistic or canny by accident of geography than those living in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. But it is a place full of individuals who are doing things that they have never done before: taking part in campaigning, attending public meetings, having conversations about the future that they want for themselves and their children with an urgency that they have never displayed before.\n\nThe civic energy unleashed by the Yes movement - and it is a movement: cross-party, cross-generation, cross-class - is palpable. Certainly the SNP party machinery is heavily involved, certainly the official Yes Scotland campaign is funded largely by SNP supporters, but not even the weariest cynic could suggest that this is a purely SNP affair.\n\nIt is National Collective, crowdsourcing more than \u00a330,000 in under six weeks to stage the summer arts \"Yestival\". It is the Radical Independence Campaign, organising mass canvasses of some of Scotland's most deprived housing schemes. It is Women for Independence, holding platform-free coffee mornings across the country for undecided female voters, and it is happening in spite of, not because of, the official constitutional campaigns.\n\nWhat seems clear from more recent polls is that those who have viewed this as a traditional election campaign could well have misjudged the mood of an electorate that is thinking very deeply about what the future of Scotland could be.\n\nThe main Westminster parties are united in their opposition to independence: Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Labour have campaigned for a No vote under the umbrella of Better Together. Individually, each of the parties is attempting to woo wavering voters with plans for increased devolution - so-called devo max. An agreement rushed out this week by the three parties promises greater income tax-raising powers, and the potential devolution of control over housing benefit, the work programme and other taxes, including air passenger duty and capital gains tax. Will it be enough to win back voters who want just a slice more independence and not a full divorce?\n\nMuch of the press - in Scotland and the wider UK - are also anti-independence. So far only the Glasgow-based Sunday Herald has publicly backed a Yes vote. And while the Yes camp has its share of celebrity endorsements, the most high-profile intervention has come from Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who donated \u00a31m to Better Together and warned:\n\nIf we leave, there will be no going back. This separation will not be quick and clean: it will take microsurgery to disentangle three centuries of close interdependence, after which we will have to deal with three bitter neighbours.\n\nUS president Barack Obama hinted his support for continuing union in June, when he said at a G7 meeting:\n\nI would say that the United Kingdom has been an extraordinary partner to us ... And we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner. But ultimately these are decisions that are to be made by the folks there.\n\nDespite the galvanising effect of grassroots engagement, this hasn't always been the cleanest of fights. Alistair Darling, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) who now heads up the Better Together campaign, accused Salmond of behaving like North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and said the campaign had been damaged by threats and intimidation. There has been much criticism of the online actions of so-called cybernats - nationalists who targeted prominent figures, such as Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, who have spoken out against independence.\n\nThe No camp, too, has faced calls to change tack after its frequent attacks on SNP proposals for Scotland's post-independence future were dubbed \"Project Fear\" by Yes supporters. The leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland, Willie Rennie, warned that voters were likely to switch to the more positive message of the Yes camp unless Better Together began to \"embrace the sunshine strategy\" that Scotland would be better off remaining part of the union.\n\nMuch ridicule was heaped upon the No campaign after some of its attempts to win round voters were slammed as patronising. A video officially titled \"The woman who made up her mind\", but quickly renamed #PatronisingBTlady by Twitter critics, backfired embarrassingly, amid accusations of lazy sexism.\n\nA list produced by the Treasury in Westminster of \"12 things that the \u00a31,400 UK dividend could buy\" (the dividend being the cash advantage of staying within the UK, according to the No parties) suggested lucky Scottish voters could use the funds to \"scoff 280 hotdogs at the Edinburgh festival\", \"share a meal of fish and chips with your family every day for around 10 weeks, with a couple of portions of mushy peas thrown in\", and, for good measure, \"have enough left over for endless hugs with everyone to celebrate being in a United Kingdom\", all illustrated with smiling Lego minifigures. Lego was unimpressed.\n\nThe Guardian has researched a series of reality checks on the likely sticking points if Scotland were to vote Yes:\n\nThe issues of currency and Scotland's potential membership of the European Union have been the most bitterly contested. The Scottish government says it would keep the pound \"come what may\", although UK chancellor George Osborne has ruled out a currency union, a position backed by Labour's shadow chancellor, Ed Balls.\n\nSimilar uncertainty surrounds an independent Scotland's entry into the EU. Sturgeon insists Scotland would rejoin as an independent member within 18 months of a yes vote. But the Scottish government does not wish to join the euro - a prerequisite for new members of the EU - or sign up to the Schengen agreement, which allows free movement across borders of member countries (the UK has an opt-out).\n\nBut the No parties disagree. Sir John Major, the former prime minister who negotiated the UK opt-outs in 1991, has said the chances of an independent Scotland retaining them as a new EU member are \"nil\". And the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, has said it would be \"difficult, if not impossible\" for an independent Scotland to join the EU.\n\nSalmond initially resisted calls to debate live on television with Darling, saying he ought to be facing Cameron (whose unpopularity in Scotland would be expected to help the Yes side). When the first Salmond v Darling debate took place in early August, opinion polls went solidly in the direction of No, by 56% to 44%. Salmond was perceived to have floundered in the face of questions over currency.\n\nBut in the second debate, at the end of August, the tables turned. This time Salmond was the clear winner, by 71% to 29%. The tide seemed to be turning.\n\nA Guardian Datablog analysis of polling for the referendum shows a consistent trend towards votes for independence. Yes is now ahead across all age groups except those aged 60 and older. Among women, undecided voters and Labour supporters, an increasing number have moved towards Yes. This has confounded predictions that previously sizeable numbers of \"don't knows\" would ultimately plump for the safe option of No when the time came to mark the ballot paper.\n\nWith a record turnout expected on 18 September - the latest projection suggests it could top 84% - the future of the United Kingdom is still too close to call.",

                    "body": "As the leaders of the UK's three main political parties arrived in Scotland to attempt stop a haemorrhage of votes for independence, Major said the UK would be a weaker global force after a yes vote.\n\nThe former prime minister, who campaigned unsuccessfully against the creation of the Scottish parliament in the 1997 general election, also warned that a yes vote in Scotland would encourage moves towards independence in Wales. \"We would almost certainly find increased demand for independence in Wales,\" he told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.\n\nMajor spoke out as David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg cast aside partisan Westminster politics to travel to Scotland to make an impassioned collective appeal to Scotland to vote to stay inside what they will say be a changed United Kingdom.\n\nThe prime minister, instinctively a unionist throughout his political career, told the people of Scotland that the rest of the UK was \"desperate\" for them not to break away. In a Daily Mail article Cameron wrote: \"The United Kingdom is a precious and special country. That is what is at stake. So let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations ripped apart.\"\n\nMajor made a similarly impassioned plea for Scotland not to vote for independence next Thursday, claiming the SNP was hiding from the dangers of uncertainty over their currency. He said: \"They are being offered further substantial devolution [by the UK parties]. But the step beyond that of becoming a separate nation opens up a whole series of particular problems that the SNP have glossed over and that the people in Scotland need to know.\n\n\"This is not a temporary change, this is forever.\"\n\nThe former prime minister went further than Cameron as he outlined the impact an independent Scotland would have on the standing of the remainder of the UK in the world. He said the UK would lose the Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland, and would struggle to keep its permanent seat on the UN security council.\n\nMajor told the Today programme: \"If Scotland voted to leave it would be disastrous for the whole of the UK. Firstly because Trident is in Scotland our defence would be imminently weakened. There are a lot of Scots in the British army. We would lose Trident, which has been our protection for a long time. If we lost Trident not to an enemy but to the actions of a neighbour - that would be just extraordinary.\n\n\"Our role in Nato would be reduced. Our relations consequently with the US would be damaged. The United Kingdom would be weaker in every international body it attends. It would certainly be weaker in the EU in the forthcoming negotiations. We would lose our seat at the top table in the UN.\"\n\nCameron has been wary of spelling out the impact of a yes vote on the remainder of the UK for fear of playing into the hands of the SNP. But the remarks by the last Tory prime minister, who rarely makes high-profile interventions without the blessing of Downing Street, highlights the deep concerns at the highest levels of Whitehall about the wide-ranging impact of a yes vote.\n\nMajor said the referendum - regardless of the result - would change the governance of the rest of the UK, which would move to a \"quasi-federalist system\".\n\nThe former prime minister said both a yes or no vote would lead to calls for greater devolution in the rest of the UK. He said: \"Both of those are going to feed a demand for more devolution to the English and Welsh regions - the north east, north west, Birmingham and Wales. That is going to have quite a lot of constitutional implications that we are going to have to deal with. We are moving inexorably towards a quasi-federalist system as a result of the extent of devolution.\"\n\nAlex Salmond, the first minister of Scotland, claimed the Westminster establishment was \"in a total and utter panic\" as its campaign disintegrated. He described the visit of the three UK party leaders as \"the biggest blunder of the campaign\".\n\nBut Alistair Darling, the leader of the Better Together campaign, sought to step up the pressure on Salmond as he contrasted the speed with which more devolved powers would be implemented with the \"years of wrangling\" that would result after a yes vote.\n\nThe former chancellor told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland: \"People have to choose between the certainty, the safety, the speed of change, which everybody wants, as opposed to a leap into the unknown where we still don't know the answers to some pretty basic questions.\"\n\nAsked specifically about the differences between the three main parties on income tax, Darling insisted that the parties were \"not that far apart\". He denied that last-minute statements from the pro-union side were anti-democratic when many voters had already returned their postal ballots.\n\nHe said that the no campaign had given voters \"a very clear picture of a Scottish parliament that will have more power than most federal governments in western Europe\".\n\nThe unprecedented cooperation across the Westminster divide exposes the fear in London that Scottish voters are not heeding the jitters in the financial markets or dark warnings about the irreversible risks to the Scottish economy entailed in a yes vote next week.\n\nThe three leaders arrive a day after Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned that a currency union was \"incompatible with sovereignty\", rejecting Salmond's claim that Scotland could share the pound and become an independent nation. The governor set out three elements necessary for a successful currency union: free movement of capital, a banking union, and joint fiscal arrangements over tax and spending.\n\nThe currency debate is being watched closely by financial markets, along with the approach that would be taken by the banking industry in the event of a yes vote. Analysts at Credit Suisse said Scotland would fall into a deep recession in the event of a yes vote. \"We think deposit flight is both highly likely and highly problematic,\" they said, pointing out that Scotland's bank assets were 12 times GDP.\n\nBuckingham Palace released a statement saying the outcome of the independence referendum was \"a matter for the people of Scotland\". The Queen is in Balmoral, where she will stay until after the vote on 18 September. The palace statement came after Salmond suggested she would be \"proud to be Queen of Scots\" and the Sunday Times said she had a \"great deal of concern\" about a yes vote.",

                    "body": "If you want to understand the stakes in the Sept. 18 referendum on Scottish independence, you have to remember that Alex Salmond, the country's first minister, is famous for his devotion to horse racing and his gambling tips.\n\nOn this occasion, he has come up with an accumulator bet.\n\nSalmond needs to win four high-risk wagers to lead Scotland to independence and deliver on the prosperity he claims will come from separating from the U.K. The danger for the people of Scotland is that they could find themselves in a weak state that is dependent on a U.K. that feels it owes them nothing.\n\nHere are the four bets:\n\n1) That Salmond can persuade a majority of Scotland's population to vote for independence on Sept. 18.\n\n2) That an independent Scotland can keep the British pound.\n\n3) That Scotland can leave the U.K. but stay in the EU.\n\n4) That Scotland can leave the U.K. but remain in NATO on its own terms.\n\nBet number 1: Salmond wants a majority to vote \"Yes\" to independence on Sept. 18. With the pro-independence \"Yes\" campaign leading in the latest poll, Salmond's gamble looks good. Until now the complacent consensus among British politicians had been that the \"Yes\" campaign would lose because it was trailing in almost every opinion poll since May 2011.\n\nHowever, as Salmond knows, British opinion pollsters can get elections wrong. The opinion polls failed to predict that Salmond's Scottish National Party (SNP) would win a majority in the 2011 Scottish parliament elections. The SNP's unexpectedly large victory, a product of its efficient grass roots organization, paved the way for the Sept. 18 referendum.\n\nIn addition to the SNP party machine, Salmond is using the Scottish government to propagandize for independence. He has built an efficient media machine that smears his opponents, including on one occasion a single mother with a child suffering from cerebral palsy. The bloated Scottish government payroll plays in the nationalists' favor, and Scottish ministers have warned businesses not to oppose independence. Some local pro-independence groups have resorted to intimidation, with anti-English extremists joining in.\n\nThe anti-independence \"No Thanks\" campaign, by contrast, has no government resources at its disposal. Those advocating to keep Scotland in the U.K. have cobbled together an organization with no track record of success. The leader of \"No Thanks,\" Alistair Darling, is a Labour politician best known for being Britain's finance minister during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAs importantly, the British government and opposition say they will not share the pound with an independent Scotland. Salmond's response is that they are bluffing. He says Scotland actually owns pound: \"it's our pound and we're keeping it.\"\n\nWhat is really happening here is that Salmond is preparing the way for a Scottish currency. Salmond has hinted as much by saying that using the pound is \"transitional,\" although without specifying to what. Having agitated for Scottish independence for over 30 years, and having studied the experience of other countries, Salmond has seen that most independent states issue their own money. A Scottish currency will also provide his government with control over monetary policy and will make running the budget easier.\n\nIndeed, Salmond has actually made a strong argument for a Scottish currency. In an important speech in March 2014, Salmond said that \"London is the dark star of the economy, inexorably sucking in resources, people and energy.\" He's right. Scotland is just 7.7% of the U.K. economy, while London accounts for 22.4% (England as a whole is 84.8% of the total). The London economy, with its exorbitant property prices and high wages, exerts greater influence over interest rates and the exchange rate than Scotland. Why then would Scotland want to use the currency of the \"dark star\"?\n\nBet number 3: Salmond wants Scotland to leave the U.K. but stay in the EU (which the U.K. joined in 1973). Numerous European politicians have said Scotland will have to apply to join the EU if it splits from the U.K. No EU state wants to set a precedent that could lead to its own break up. Again, Salmond says they are bluffing.\n\nThe problem is that the nationalist attitude to the EU is malleable. Salmond conveniently forgets that in 1975 the SNP campaigned to take the U.K. out of the EU's predecessor, the European Economic Community. The SNP has consistently argued that the British government in London routinely ignores Scotland's needs, hence the need for independence. Yet an independent Scotland will supposedly be an EU member on precisely the terms that the British government has negotiated.\n\nIf this bet goes wrong, Scotland may have to leave the EU and negotiate to join from the outside. That would give the U.K. government tremendous influence in negotiations over using the pound and military bases in Scotland, to name just two issues.\n\nBet number 4: Salmond wants an independent Scotland to keep Britain's membership of NATO, but with special provisions. In Scottish nationalist speak this will involve a \"transition from being a NATO member as part of the U.K. to becoming an independent member of the alliance.\"\n\nThe SNP, which opposed NATO membership until 2012, says that Scotland will be part of the Atlantic alliance on two conditions. The first is that nuclear weapons leave the country -- the U.K.'s nuclear submarines and their weapons are based in Scotland and U.S. nuclear-armed vessels visit the country. The second is that an independent Scotland would \"only take part in U.N. sanctioned operations.\"\n\nBoth conditions are impossible for NATO, which is an explicitly nuclear alliance whose only combat operation, in Kosovo in 1999, was not U.N. sanctioned. Salmond knows this because he publicly denounced the Kosovo war as \"an action of dubious legality, but above all one of unpardonable folly.\"\n\nIn practice, in NATO or neutral (the more likely outcome), an independent Scotland would have security forces so weak that it would depend on the U.K. The nationalists claim that the Scottish armed forces would be small but capable, like those of the Nordic members of NATO, with defense assets claimed from current U.K. forces. This assumes an agreement on the division of U.K. assets and liabilities -- an unlikely prospect given the nationalists' determination to expel the U.K. nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe nationalists' defense plans also ignore the fact that NATO's Nordic members shelter under the U.S.-U.K.-French nuclear deterrent. The Nordic states, which feel particularly threatened by a resurgent Russia, rely on the U.S. and other NATO allies for many aspects of security, particularly intelligence and technology.\n\nAlex Salmond may soon crown his 32-year political career by splitting Scotland from the U.K., dividing mainland Britain for the first time in over 300 years. His accumulator bet is that Scotland can split from the U.K. but retain all the benefits of being in the U.K. These odds may be too great even for Salmond. Instead, the result could be a separate Scotland independent largely in name, but in practice dependent on a resentful U.K.\n\nAndrew Apostolou is a writer on international affairs based in Washington D.C.",

                    "body": "Something has changed in Scotland in the last few days. It has been a long time coming and building, but you can feel it in the air, in the streets, and in the looks of strangers acknowledging each other. Scots are growing aware that they have a collective power and confidence which Westminster fears.\n\nThe British political elite and establishment have now woken up to the prospect that all this is real. For the past three years, from the SNP winning in 2011 to the Edinburgh Agreement of October 2012 between the Scottish and UK governments, the latter viewed Scotland as a non-event, a problem contained and controlled. The \"referendum\" they continually referred to was not Scotland 2014, but the still-hypothetical vote on Europe in 2017.\n\nSuddenly, Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have realised that Scottish independence is possible. They don't like it, obviously, but they don't understand it either, nor have they been paying attention. Cameron has played a famously low key role in the campaign, sneaking in and out of Scotland speaking to the few audiences where he can be guaranteed a friendly response. He refused to debate with Salmond, which now looks a disastrous decision, but was a realistic recognition of the \"toxic tartan Tory\" brand.\n\nEd Miliband has played a worse hand. He and his invisible shadow cabinet have hardly put any effort into saving what is meant to be a Labour heartland. Miliband has not until recently received regular briefings on Scotland. His approach has only been excelled in ineptitude by the Scottish Labour Party, which still hasn't adapted its defeat in 2007 - the seachange of Scottish politics. It is still stuck in its pathological detesting of the SNP and Alex Salmond, which has clouded its judgement for years.\n\nNow Cameron, Miliband and Clegg are travelling north to save the union. They are making their way to Scotland separately like a bunch of furtive characters ashamed of what they are up to, or afraid of being apprehended. If there were a criminal offence for being an incompetent politician all three would be charged and put up in Barlinnie Prison. Once they have arrived north of the border, they dare not even contemplate sharing a platform.\n\nThis goes beyond dislike of Tories. Rather embarrassingly for Labour, Cameron and Miliband have the exact same levels of trust in Scotland: 23 per cent. The supposed saviour of the hour, Gordon Brown, is on 32 per cent (the same as Alistair Darling). First Minister Alex Salmond has a 42 per cent rating after seven years in office and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, 44 per cent.\n\nThere is an increasing problem with nationalism. British nationalism. It seems obsessed with an imagined past, a continual parade of military anniversaries, hyperbolic rhetoric (\"greatest union in the history of the human race\"), symbols and flags. They have become vexo nats, to coin a phrase from vexology, the study of flags. How appropriate that as the UK's fate hangs in the balance, Cameron decides to fly the saltire from Downing Street, and Miliband joins him inviting Labour councils up and down the land to do the same. Who knew it? Never mind the bedroom tax, foodbanks, or the grotesque self-interest of the City, Cameron and company understand and \"love\" Scotland, and don't want us to leave. They plan to show it by lots of flag-waving.\n\nOne opinion poll with a Yes lead has produced wholesale panic and sudden announcements of new plans and goodies. This, when people have already started voting. When the debate isn't just about the constitution. When it isn't just about Scotland, but the problem with the capture of British politics and the state by corporate class groupthink. And when the Scottish debate reflects genuine discussion about how much room for maneouvre and choice it is possible to have in the face of market fundamentalism and globalisation. Scottish public opinion trusts the Scottish government more than Westminster to defend the social compact. All of this runs much deeper than what Scots think of Cameron and toxic Tories.\n\nLast minute pro-union suggestions of giving more powers to Scotland fail to understand, as constitutional expert Peter Hennessy observed, that there are British consequences from such proposals. Greater Scottish self-government in an asymmetrical union eventually affects the intricate balance of the entire state. With the Scotland Acts of 1998 and 2012 on the statute book, that point has now been reached, once more raising the prospect of the West Lothian question and the voting rights of Scottish MPs at Westminster.\n\nWhatever the result on 18 September a different Scotland has emerged and found expression. The \"idea\" of independence has dominated and defined the campaign. Even lots of No voters talk fondly of the notion saying, \"I would like to believe we could do it, but. . .\" That is a generational change.\n\nScotland has an independence of the mind. It is on the verge of formal independence. That then brings forth all sorts of fascinating questions. Can the hopes and energies released by pro-independence forces continue post-Yes? What of the SNP's rather timid, cautious version of independence with its economic straightjacket connected to the Bank of England and Treasury? How will Westminster react to its biggest peacetime crisis if a Yes happens? Will they understand that Scottish voters have rejected their discredited economic, social and political system?\n\nLast weekend, with Roanne Dods, I organised Imagination - Scotland's first ever Festival of Ideas on Glasgow's Southside. It was firmly non-aligned and non-partisan on the independence question, but embodied a living, real culture of self-determination.\n\nWith an atmosphere of curiosity, energy and generosity, constitutional lawyer and adviser to Scots and British Tories Adam Tomkins talked openly of the fundamental failings of No. Over a thousand people heard Will Hutton hesitate and admit that if he lived in Scotland \"he would be sorely tempted to vote Yes\".\n\nThoughtful discussions took place on the challenges facing Scotland both post-independence and as part of the union. Former Salmond adviser Alex Bell warned of the dangers of Scotland being governed post-independence by \"the same Marks and Spencers suits\", Robin McAlpine eulogised the virtues of Common Weal, and filmmaker Eleanor Yule spoke of the role of gatekeepers in limiting cultural self-confidence.\n\nThe closing discussion took place in the beautiful, dilapidated Govanhill Swimming Pool, scene of a famous Glasgow battle between the council and local people, which saw the pool shut and then given back to the community after a decade. Janice Galloway moved people with her heartfelt and deeply personal \"Journey to Yes\", while Billy Bragg and Fintan OToole wished the independence cause well.\n\nBragg played two numbers, the first of which, \"Take Down the Union Jack\" brought the house down. He then observed, looking at England and Scotland: \"We don't have agency. You do. Don't let us down.\" O'Toole commented that \"Scotland has already won by the common assertion of dignity. The question is can you be good winners?\" It all felt like a mature, reflective democracy calmly discussing its future choices.\n\nScotland has grown up these last few years. That is a change which is about more than whether the people vote for independence. The same cannot not be said of Westminster, which is increasingly broken and represents a discredited, narrow, nasty political culture. No wonder more and more Scots think that we can make a better fist of it governing ourselves.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, the immense changes and upheaval about to take place could see a progressive-minded country and culture governing itself with compassion and decency on this island of Britain. It might just give hope to the people of the rUK to summon up the energy and force to challenge the entrenched forces and assumptions which have dominated Westminster and British politics and society for the last three decades. It is time to break free, not in some nationalist sense, but from the vested interests and orthodoxies which have so dominated British society and public life for so long.",

                    "body": "The two Scotsmen, Britain's prime minister and finance minister between 2007 and 2010, often fought each other in office. Darling once described his old boss as \"brutal and volcanic.\" Brown reportedly wanted to sack Darling during the financial crisis.\n\nBut now here was Brown waxing lyrical about Darling, who heads the \"Better Together\" campaign that is trying to convince Scots to reject independence.\n\n\"It's his expertise and integrity and strength of purpose that is winning this argument,\" Brown told the crowd of a few hundred in a meeting hall in the coastal city of Dundee.\n\n\"Rubbish!\" a heckler in the back of the room shouted. \"Absolute rubbish!\" The heckler continued to shout criticism of Brown's Labour government and its policies before officials removed him.\n\nThe incident captures a lot about the Scottish independence debate: the passion and even anger of secessionists; the difficulty unionists have in making their argument; even the strange political alliances that have formed, especially as the unionists have grown more desperate.\n\nA week before the referendum on Sept. 18, momentum is with those who want change.\n\nA Sept. 7 poll for YouGov showed support for independence in the lead - 51 percent to 49. Thanks to the Yes campaign's savvier ground game, the gap between the two sides has tightened dramatically in the past few weeks, down from an average of well over 10 points for most of the year until August. With pollsters expecting up to 80 percent of all Scottish voters to have a say in the referendum - in a general election typically only around 60 percent of Scots vote - the outcome is almost impossible to predict.\n\nFor Scots nationalists, a vote for full statehood for the first time since 1707 would be the realization of what seemed like an improbable dream, one they have worked towards for decades.\n\nFor the rest of Britain, a \"yes\" vote would mean profound change. Scotland, with its $250-billion economy, 5.3 million people, oil industry, and nuclear submarine base, would split away, leaving what's left of Britain with a $2.25 trillion economy and 58.8 million people.\n\nThat would mark an ignominious end for a geopolitical construct that has, in different forms, spanned the heyday of the British Empire, the U.S. war of independence, and two world wars. It would hurt Prime Minister David Cameron, who would surely come under pressure to quit as the man who lost Scotland, but would also hurt the opposition Labour Party because the loss of Scotland would leave what remains of Britain more politically conservative. That could make it more likely that Britain pulls out of the European Union.\n\n\"Together, we get a seat at the U.N. Security Council, real clout in NATO and Europe, and the prestige to host events like the G8,\" Cameron said a few weeks ago. \"If we lost Scotland, if the UK changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation.\"\n\nTHE 'YES' GROUND GAME\n\nIf the Yes campaign wins, many will put it down to its ability to get out its message in cities and villages across the country.\n\n\"I've had two brochures from Yes Scotland last week, two the week before, a van even drove up my street playing 'Moving on Up,' said one resident in Edinburgh who supports staying in Britain. \"Someone came to my door the other day ... it turned out they were from Better Together. I told them 'you need to step it up!'\"\n\nThe voter declined to be named, fearing, she said, \"a brick through the window\" from an angry nationalist. She described some Yes campaigners as \"bullies,\" but conceded they were doing a better job of mobilizing support on the ground. (Despite a lot of online vitriol there have been few incidents of violence.)\n\nThe pro-independence camp, Yes Scotland, argues that Scotland, which already has its own parliament with oversight of policy areas such as health and education, would be freer, better governed and wealthier if it went it alone. It would be able to use the revenues from its North Sea oil fields and could raise its own taxes, it says.\n\nAlex Salmond, Scotland's charismatic and combative First Minister and head of the Yes campaign, calls his opponents' campaign \"Project Fear\" because of what he says is its relentless negativity.\n\nAt the heart of his campaign has been the paradoxical offering that Scots could keep many of the trappings of the UK while simultaneously leaving it. An independent Scotland could keep the pound, still have the Queen as its head of state, and still build Britain's warships, he argues.\n\n\"Our campaign has been around the idea of a total belief in Scotland,\" says Stephen Noon, its chief strategist. \"Independence is not going to be a land of milk and honey but there's no challenge we can't actually deal with.\"\n\nOne of the independence campaign's main tactics has been to target disaffected Labour voters. Scotland mostly votes for left-of-center parties and resents any national government led by the right-wing Conservative Party. In recent times, that sense of alienation even existed under Labour, which governed Britain between 1997 and 2010.\n\nLabour gave powers to a new Scottish parliament, promising that would remove the \"threat of separatism.\" But despite their greater autonomy, many Scots felt the Labour government in London veered too far to the right, especially on issues such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2011, Scots voting in a Scottish parliamentary election overwhelmingly opted for the populist Scottish National Party (SNP). The surprise nationalist victory gave SNP leader Salmond a mandate for this year's referendum.\n\nIn the Pollok area of Glasgow, where joblessness runs high, some traditional Labour voters now seem more open to breaking away, which is why organizers of the Yes campaign have been pounding the footpaths for months. Pollok has nearly 4,000 unemployed adults, the third most in Scotland, and Labour clung on to the seat by fewer than 650 votes in 2011.\n\n\"When we're on doorsteps, people are saying 'If we only vote once, it will be in September. This is our chance to change something,'\" said David McDonald, a local SNP councilor.\n\nA recent two-hour canvassing session shows how the Yes campaign does it. Half a dozen volunteers garner the opinions of more than 100 residents, who are asked to rate their views on a scale of one to 10, one being completely against independence and 10 being for it.\n\nNines and 10s are seen as certain Yes votes, while people who rate themselves four are \"probably 'no' voters who are being polite,\" McDonald says. But anyone who rates themselves a five, six, seven or eight is given information about how Scotland would be better off solo and targeted for a return visit.\n\nThe idea is to convert these people in the middle one by one. Sometimes, the Yes campaign will even ask pro-independence family members to tackle more sceptical relatives.\n\nYes campaigners like to play up the notion that they are a big, diverse tent. \"It's not our debate anymore. It's the people's debate, and we can't control it,\" Calum Cashley, an SNP activist in Edinburgh, said. \"At first, as a political person, I was worried by that. But in fact it's hugely liberating.\"\n\nDoor-knocking is not always easy. One Yes campaigner in Pollok was deterred by a bulldog. \"He's English,\" the dog's owner offered by way of explanation. At another house a head appeared over the fence. \"Not today guys, OK?\" the resident said firmly.\n\nBut elsewhere the campaigners were received warmly. One man approached the group for stickers that he could put on the cars of neighbors who were voting \"no\".\n\nJoe Docherty, an 18-year-old Yes campaign volunteer, joined the nationalist movement after the SNP's surprise 2011 victory. This is his first campaign but Docherty speaks eloquently about his hope for an independent Scotland, with a parliament more responsive to Scotland's needs than Westminster in far-off London.\n\n\"When two governments make decisions affecting one nation, policy can't be consistent. Devolution is fundamentally flawed,\" he said, demonstrating an engagement with the issues that is not unusual among Scotland's younger voters.\n\nThat sort of engagement and attention to detail has helped energize the campaign, even if for years polls had shown support for independence to be stuck between a quarter and a third of voters. \"The Yes campaign has definitely got anyone who potentially might have been persuadable,\" said Rachel Ormston, senior research director at ScotCen Social Research.\n\n\"A BIT RUBBISH\"\n\nAnti-independence campaigners argue that Scotland already has the best of both worlds: continued membership of the UK and increasing autonomy. Why would anyone want to risk that, they ask, especially when an independent Scotland would be unable to formally keep the pound and struggle to rejoin the EU.\n\n\"If we decide to leave, there is no going back, there is no second chance,\" Darling told voters in August.\n\nBut despite the fact they started with such a clear lead, the Better Together camp has struggled to motivate voters and defend its majority.\n\nOne of the problems has been a relentless focus on the potential risks of separation rather than the benefits of staying united. There have also been specific missteps. Women and older people have expressed consistent support for staying in Britain. But a Better Together campaign video that targeted undecided female voters - and featured an actress complaining \"there's only so many hours in the day\" to decide how to vote - ended up backfiring because viewers saw it as condescending and felt it stereotyped women as ditherers.\n\n\"Better Together's patronizing woman helped, undoubtedly, because engagement on our Facebook went up 1,200 percent in a week,\" Natalie McGarry, a founder of Women for Independence, said.\n\nBetter Together defended the video and said it represented concerns regularly raised by voters. The first YouGov poll to show Yes in the lead saw a substantial rise in support from women; experts said that women were simply making their minds up later.\n\nSome pro-union campaigners acknowledge that they had struggled to get across their message.\n\n\"The posters, the video, it's all a bit rubbish,\" said Bruce Findlay, the former manager of Scottish rock group Simple Minds, shortly before giving a speech outlining the benefits of the United Kingdom. \"It's hard for the No campaign ... backing the word \"no\" and trying to put a positive spin on it.\"\n\nFindlay felt that the Yes campaign had escaped deep scrutiny; he was angry that some Yes campaigners had invoked the name of Nelson Mandela and suggested it was time for Scotland to throw off their oppressors.\n\n\"How dare they?\" Findlay asked. \"One of his (Mandela's) greatest achievements was keeping his country together - they're trying to take it apart, trying to create division.\"\n\nOther \"no\" voters say they have become increasingly reluctant to speak out for fear of being branded un-Scottish. One pro-union Labour MP, Jim Murphy, found his attempts at a grassroots tour of 100 towns in 100 days disrupted when he was egged by an opponent in Kirkcaldy, in what he has described as an attempt to silence him. The Yes campaign says the aggression runs in both directions. Police have investigated online death threats against Alex Salmond, who dismissed those behind them as \"cyber clowns.\"\n\nThe No campaign has also struggled to coordinate the three main national parties - Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. All three parties want to keep Scotland in the union. But while the Conservatives and Lib Dems currently govern together, the No campaign has largely rested on the Labour machine in Scotland.\n\nAFTER THE DEBATES\n\nMild-mannered Darling outflanked Salmond in the first televised debate on Aug. 5. Salmond seemed uncertain and evasive and Darling won points by focusing on Salmond's views on currency. All three national parties say they will not formally share the British pound with Scotland; Salmond says this is a bluff.\n\nThe Yes campaign vowed to be clearer on issues such as currency and by the second debate on Aug. 22 a much more animated Salmond dominated.\n\n\"If Alistair Darling wanted a joust, then he got one,\" a senior source in the Yes campaign told Reuters.\n\n\"And Alec is better at jousting.\"\n\nSince then, Salmond has emphasized the uncertainty on issues such as Europe or powers for Scotland that would follow a No vote, turning the unionists' tactic against them. With confusion over key issues, nationalists have sought to simplify the debate: the brave chance of a better future, or the status quo.\n\nThat the choice is so stark is mostly down to British Prime Minister David Cameron. He insisted that the referendum question be a simple in-out choice, rather than including the possibility of much greater devolution within the union.\n\nAs support for independence surged in the past few weeks, the three national parties promised a new timetable for extra powers and greater autonomy - as long as Scots voted No. London-based politicians headed north to try and shore up the vote. Critics dismissed the late interest as panic.\n\n\"I think that sometimes the media and Westminster politicians operate on a different level to what's happening on the ground,\" the Yes campaign source said.\n\n\"If they're surprised at what's happening, it's because they haven't been paying attention.\"",

And so we are demanding a tight-timetable with tough deadlines and streamlined procedures.\n\n\"A 'No' vote on 18 September will not be an end point, but the starting gun for action on 19 September, when straight away we will kick off a plan to deliver the enhanced devolution that we want.\n\nHe added that according to this timetable the draft laws will be reading around 25 January - Burns Night.\n\n15.09 David Cameron uses meeting with team GB Special Olympics athletes to say it is \"wonderful\" to see the United Kingdom competing together as one\n\nThe Prime Minister has invited the group of athletes with intellectual disabilities before they head out to compete in the European Summer Games in Antwerp in Downing Street.\n\nHosting a reception for the athletes in the garden at No 10, the Prime Minister said the games would help to change attitudes towards intellectual disabilities.\n\nHe said: \"With what you do in the next fortnight, you are going to make us all proud, you are going to inspire a whole country and you are going to change people's attitudes.\n\n\"It's wonderful, isn't it, that we have got representatives from right across the United Kingdom all competing and taking part together as one team GB?\" he added.\n\n14.50 One in four Scots think MI5 is working to thwart independence\n\nPlus close to half believe Westminster has found new oil reserves but is keeping them secret during the campaign. Those conspiratorial findings and more in a YouGov poll commissioned by BuzzFeed.\n\n14.45 Some more musing on the political reamnifications of the Royal baby news.\n\nOur features writer Olivia Goldhill has been gauging opinion, including from Tory MSP Alex Johnstone. Have a read here.\n\n14.20 Alan Cumming urges Scots to vote Yes\n\nThe Holywood star, one of the most vocal celebrity backers of the independence campaign, has flown in from America to join Sturgeon and other activists on the trail.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest, especially in the last week or so people all around the world are perking up and noticing,\" said the X-Men star, originally form Aberfeldy, Perthshire.\n\n\"We think we live in a democracy but if we don't get the government we vote for, we don't. That's what this is all about.\"\n\n14.00 1,700 Glasgow jobs 'at risk from independence'\n\nA \u00a3350m development plan to double the size of Glasgow's Buchanan Galleries is under threat due to possibility of independence, the Financial Times has reported.\n\nThe paper says that \"a person familiar with the project\", which is set to create 1,700 jobs, has warned it might be derailed by a Yes vote.\n\nLand Securities, one of the partners behind the joint venture, said: \"We're committed to Glasgow. It's a prime centre for us. We're not going to comment on the referendum itself.\"\n\n13.18 Brown takes the Unionist argument Stateside\n\nGordon Brown, the man who once \"saved the world\" - his words, not mine - has turned to the US media to help save the Union.\n\nWriting an opinion piece in the New York Times, the former prime minister dipped into American history and the SNP's past - the party won 0.5 per cent of the Scottish vote in 1955, he notes - to make an emotive case a No vote.\n\nThere is some fascinating stuff in there, not least Brown's take on the complexities of the Union: \"Britain has never been united by ethnicity. We are four nations in one state. And, always pragmatic, we have never shouted from the rooftops about the shared ideas that bind us together in the manner of America (land of liberty and opportunity) or France (libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9).\n\n\"Instead, Britain has its institutions -- from the monarchy and the army to the House of Commons and the BBC -- none of which now appear able to generate enough Scottish pride in the union to secure a decisive \"no\" vote. To many, the United Kingdom today looks as if it is \"united\" in name only.\"\n\n\"But delve deeper,\" he adds, and you find a United Kingdom which \"does indeed have a basis for partnership in the values\" it shares. Well worth a full read over lunch if you can spare the time.\n\nAlistair Darling on the campaign trail today\n\n13.00 Will the new Royal baby save the Union?\n\nJames Kirkup, our Telegraph's Political Editor, has tackled head-on the question being asked around Agas and water coolers across Scotland this morning. (Probably.)\n\nAfter noting news of the Duchess's pregnancy is \"primarily a story of simple joy and happiness for a young family\", he muses the possible political consequences and comes to this conclusion.\n\nAmid such feelings of suspicion, it seems likely that at least some Scots will see the Royal pregnancy as just another Establishment ploy. Even those not given to conspiracy theories may just be mildly insulted by the idea that they would decide something as important as the future of their nation on the basis of a pretty lady in a dress having a baby.\n\nSo while Unionists may be tempted to see the Royal pregnancy as a potential boost their campaign, they may well be better advised simply to say nothing about it all beyond \"Congratulations, Your Royal Highnesses.\"\n\n12.30 Pro-independence business group plays down pound movements\n\nIan McDougall, Managing Director of corporate finance and accounting firm McDougall Johnstone and board member of Business for Scotland - which is campaigning for a Yes vote - has played down the significance of movements on the pound today.\n\n\"A 0.4 per cent variation against the dollar caused by hedgefund speculation isn't much of a story; Alistair Darling caused a 1 per cent drop with his prediction of long term economic gloom for the UK almost exactly six years ago,\" said Mr McDougall.\n\n\"Sterling's value floats on the markets, that's not a story but the irresponsible actions of George Osborne should be. His threats of currency instability and empty promises of non-existent new powers for Scotland are bizarre to say the least. He holds one of the great offices of the UK state but can't bring himself to act like a statesman.\"\n\nThe pro-UK side, no doubt, would strongly contest that analysis. In the past, they've had a simple riposte - it's the prospect of breaking up the Union, not the case for keeping it together, that is creating the instability.\n\n12.12 Darling plays down impact of Royal baby on independence debate\n\nAsked on Sky News how today's news will play in the campaign to save the Union, Mr Darling said: \"I'm sure everybody would offer the Duke and Duchess the warmest congratulations and the very best. But I'm quite sure that all that is completely above politics.\"\n\n12.00 So what are the polls really doing?\n\nJohn Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University and chief reader of the referendum polls, has been weighing up what is really going on.\n\n\"I think the truth is that as for so much of this referendum campaign, the message from the opinion polls is not entirely clear,\" Prof Curtice said. Full video of the Professor's thoughts can be found over here.\n\nAlso, one to watch - we're told a TNS poll is due out at midnight tonight. Night owls, keep an eye on Twitter.\n\n11.40 How does Scotland measure up to the UK?\n\nScotland makes up 8.1 per cent of UK jobs, 8.3 per cent of the UK's population and enjoys the lowest unemployment rate of the Union's four nations.\n\nThat, and much more besides, from an interesting breakdown of the stats by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n11.30 Boris joins the fight\n\nWriting in today's Telegraph, Boris Johnson delivered - in his own unique way - an emotional plea for the Union to stay together. Here's a taste of what he had to say.\n\nLook at the map - so often rendered by cartoonists from the 18th century onwards as Britannia sitting down: rump in east Anglia, feet in Cornwall, and topped off with that sweeping Scottish cerebrum and helmet. Chop it off - decapitate Britain at Carlisle and you can no longer call it Britain; and what goes for geography must go for politics, too. Take Scotland away from England and you are losing a critical part of our political nomenclature. There was no British government before the union with Scotland; there was no British electorate; there were no British interests. There was England and Wales, and there was Scotland. Take away Scotland, and we destroy Britain.\n\n11.20 Alex Salmond welcomes Royal baby news\n\n\"It is wonderful to hear that the Earl and Countess of Strathearn are expecting their second baby,\" said the First Minister, using the pair's Scottish titles.\n\n\"This is very happy news for any couple, and on behalf of the people of Scotland, I am delighted to send our best wishes to the Countess and our hearty congratulations to the Royal couple.\"\n\n10.40 Independence debate in pictures\n\nOur photo team has pulled together a cracking gallery of independence campaign snaps. View them all here, it is being updated constantly.\n\nAlex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, and Nicola Sturgeon, his deputy\n\n10.20 Pound takes a tumble\n\nThe markets have opened and investors are flogging the pound after the weekend's YouGov poll put the Yes camp in the lead. Scottish shares are also taking a hit.\n\nThe news makes our website splash and is likely to be one of the most significant stories from the referendum race today.\n\nHere's what our financial reporters Lauren Davidson and Ben Martin have to say on the matter. Full piece over here.\n\nSterling suffered its biggest intra-day loss in over a year, sliding to $1.6150 against the dollar, its lowest point since November. This follows last week's decline of 0.7pc as support for the \"Yes\" campaign continued to rise.\n\nScotland-exposed stocks in the FTSE 100 also came under pressure and dominated the fallers in London's benchmark share index. Lloyds Banking Group slid 2.4pc, Weir Group fell 2.3pc and Standard Life declined 2.2pc.\n\n10.00 Why the No camp still believe they'll win\n\nAmid the panic from Westminster, there are some calm voices to be found amid the No camp. Having had a chat with five senior pro-UK figures to gauge reaction to the poll, this blog outlines why they still believe the Union will be saved.\n\nSpin? Self-delusion? Or a clear-sighted view on where the race stands? Judge for yourself. Here's one of the reasons they are backing victory.\n\nFirstly, the vote just got real. There has been genuine, four-letter frustration in some quarters that still on the doorstep some Scots are thinking about \"giving independence a try\", as if it's something that can be tested on for size and returned if the fit's not right.\n\nBut now the Scottish electorate is at the cliff edge, peering below and wondering whether to jump. As the prospect of independence appears more real through the polls, so - the pro-UK camp hopes - do the uncertainties.\n\n\"The poll this weekend might just be the best thing that has happened to the No campaign,\" said one pro-UK figure, more than a little optimistically. The way the markets react today will be crucial too - if the pound wobbled at a six-point No lead last week, what will happen with Yes in front? Financial jitters reinforce the economic uncertainties put front and centre by the No campaign, while the economy remains the top issue for voters.\n\nAlex Salmond, Scotland's First Minister, and Alistair Darling, Better Together leader\n\n9.40 Americans riding to the rescue?\n\nPaul Krugman, Nobel Prize winner and lead New York Times commentator, has written a new piece on the implications of a Yes vote. Better Together clearly feel it's a win for them - key campaign figures have been tweeting it out this morning.\n\nFull piece here. Here's a taster of the tone.\n\nWell, I have a message for the Scots: Be afraid, be very afraid. The risks of going it alone are huge. You may think that Scotland can become another Canada, but it's all too likely that it would end up becoming Spain without the sunshine.\n\nAnd then this, on currency ...\n\nIn short, everything that has happened in Europe since 2009 or so has demonstrated that sharing a currency without sharing a government is very dangerous. In economics jargon, fiscal and banking integration are essential elements of an optimum currency area. And an independent Scotland using Britain's pound would be in even worse shape than euro countries, which at least have some say in how the European Central Bank is run.\n\nI find it mind-boggling that Scotland would consider going down this path after all that has happened in the last few years. If Scottish voters really believe that it's safe to become a country without a currency, they have been badly misled.\n\n9.20 The morning media appearances\n\nAs is becoming increasingly common, the morning airwaves both sides of the border were packed with referendum chatter.\n\nAlistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, was on the Today programme. \"I always said the polls will narrow. I believe we will win this referendum. People are very alive to the risks,\" he said. The London Twitterati heard desperation in his voice.\n\nNicola Sturgeon was on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland and made this interesting comment - fluctuations in the pound, as happened last week when the polls tightened, merely show that Scotland has a \"strong economy\". If the money markets react badly to the weekend YouGov poll putting the Yes camp ahead, those words could come back to haunt Alex Salmond's number two.\n\nThere was also an intriguing clash between Murdo Fraser, a Tory MSP, and Fergus Ewing, the SNP's Energy Minister. Mr Ewing was repeatedly pushed to name how much splitting up Royal Mail would cost the electorate after independence - the SNP propose renationalising part of the business. No answer was forthcoming. It's this kind of knuckling down on the details of independence which Unionists hope will help win the day come September 18.\n\nMore media appearances no doubt will happen throughout the day. Stay tuned here for the latest.\n\n9.00 Good morning and welcome to our live blog on the Scottish independence campaign.\n\nYesterday was the day Westminster finally woke up to what's happening in Scotland, and this morning's papers reflect just that.\n\n\"Ten days to save the Union\" is our splash - and so pretty much everyone else's. \"Ten days to save the United Kingdom\" says the Indy. \"Parties unite in last-ditch bid to save the Union\" is the Times' take. \"Last stand to keep the Union\" wails the Guardian.\n\nThe Queen's fears that these really are the last days for the United Kingdom take the lead in the Mail (\"Queen's Fear Over Break Up of Britain\") and the Mirror (\"Don't Let Me Be Last Queen of Scotland\"). Meanwhile, the FT and the Sun focus on the panic within Better Together - \"Jocky Horrow Show\" roars the Sun. \"Pro-union camp 'in chaos' as poll puts nationalists ahead\" says the FT.\n\nScotland is in full-time campaign mode, with Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister, in Glasgow, Ed Balls in Aberdeen, and later Gordon Brown in Midlothian. We'll keep you up to date with all the latest developments here.\n\nClick to enlarge: Voters share their views on Scottish independence",

Celebrating the UK and the shared history of its individual nations, he said: \"This is the group of small islands in the North Atlantic that have punched above our weight for centuries - and we've done so together.\n\n\"As individuals and as nations, we have done extraordinary things. This is the special alchemy of the UK - you mix together Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland and together we smash expectations.\"\n\nMr Cameron warned voters in Scotland that there \"will be no second chances\" if they vote for independence.\n\nMr Cameron, Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg have cancelled today's session of Prime Minister's Questions and instead pledged to visit Scotland to \"listen and talk to voters\".\n\nMr Salmond claimed that the three party leaders were making the biggest \"blunder\" yet of the No campaign by making a last-minute trip to Scotland.

                    "body": "Guardian readers on making the best choice for a stronger Scotland and the rest of the UK\n\nOn Tuesday, Westminster politicians woke up to the fact that Scotland is very close to voting for independence. They are scrambling to throw together a plan promising new powers to the Scots to convince them to stay in the union (Brown to the rescue? No camp sends for ex-PM to save union, 9 September. Never mind that many of us have already cast our ballots in the post. And never mind that any plan so hurriedly thrown together will not fill many voters with confidence.\n\nBut supporters of the yes campaign would do well to acknowledge that the change they promise will not simply be delivered by a successful referendum. Any real change to how Scotland is governed will only be hard won, after difficult compromise and painful sacrifice. In this intense atmosphere, we might remember Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign, when he offered \"Change you can believe in\" to a country that desperately wanted it. Hindsight, however, has not been kind to this promise. Today, the approval ratings of the president are at dismal 41% - the lowest of any US president since the 1950s. The American political system is more ideologically divided than ever.\n\nYet we continue to imagine that someone else can make changes for us, while we carry on comfortably as always. Whatever the result of the referendum, once all of the emotional turmoil has settled, may all of us who long for real change across Scotland and the rest of the UK finally commit to getting down to work and trying to make that change happen.\n\nChristopher Brittain\n\nAberdeen\n\n* The issue of a timetable for further powers to the Scottish parliament is secondary. The primary concern is: \"what powers?\" There needs to be clarity on that before the referendum date. Otherwise the Scots are being offered the same pig in the same poke as in 1979. By 19 September, the three Westminster parties, whose recent record for probity is not to be relied on, will have no need to offer any more than the lowest common denominator at best. As a Scottish voter, why should I place any faith in their offering?\n\nJames Reid\n\nCastle Douglas\n\n* The polls suggest that the result of next Thursday's referendum will leave approximately half of the population of Scotland profoundly unhappy. The polls also show that many people are still not clear about the relative merits of devo max and independence. In this context it doesn't make any sense to have a single yes/no decision-making process. What is required is an opportunity to try one of the solutions, and then choose the other if the first proves to be unsatisfactory. Coupling a timetable for extensive devolution with an undertaking to hold a further referendum in (say) 10 years would offer this option.\n\nStephen Gardner\n\nManchester\n\n* The coalition government failed to agree to bring in proportional representation for UK voters. Had it done so, Scots anywhere in the union could have voted SNP, indeed any UK voters could have voted SNP. This would have the effect of strengthening the influence at Westminster of Scotland and Scottish ideas about social and fiscal policy. That opportunity was lost but still could still offer a compromise, post-vote, that would enfranchise the Scottish diaspora and leaven the monotony of the first-past-the-post system. The current democratic deficit lies at the root of the Scottish yearning for a more equitable voting system, and explains the lamentable turnout at elections of the nation at large.\n\nCraig Sams\n\nHastings, East Sussex\n\n* How long has Westminster known about the Scottish referendum? How long has the Labour leadership been aware of the disastrous effect on the party that a yes vote will bring? How long has it taken for Ed Miliband to show himself in Scotland? We are now seeing the no strategy panic set in. I received an email yesterday from Labour asking for donations, or for volunteers to phone Scottish party members to ask them not to vote. Talk about too little, too late. Add to this Gordon Brown being asked to play Santa Claus to tempt the voters (with the very things they were asking for prior to any talk of a referendum), plus Ed Miliband's apparent endorsement of guards strung along the Scottish border (nice one, Ed), and you have the perfect yes-voting storm.\n\nAs an expat Scot, I don't relish the break up of the union, but if the country of my birth wants to beat a retreat from Westminster and from the Labour party's apparent loss of memory regarding Scotland's unswerving support of the Labour movement since its inception, then I can live with it.\n\nJanet Fearnley\n\nFarnham, Surrey\n\n* Gordon Brown acknowledges (Report, 8 September) that it is proving \"difficult\" to win over Scots to stay in the UK because of anger at coalition policies on austerity and privatisation. Yet in the Better Together campaign Labour is in coalition with the coalition, giving credence to the very parties that are implementing austerity.\n\nEven worse, should Labour win the general election in 2015 it too has committed to austerity policies to eliminate the budget deficit in the lifetime of one parliament, so twice as many cuts will take place in five years compared to the past five years. If the Scots don't want to vote for austerity, why should any Briton vote for Labour and austerity in 2015?\n\nDarrall Cozens\n\nCoventry\n\n* There is one thing Gordon Brown could do to show his support for devo max. He could pledge to stand for the Scottish parliament and offer himself as leader of Scottish Labour and possible first minister. That might just be too much of a two-edged sword.\n\nGerard McMullan\n\nLondon\n\n* A wonderfully insightful and splendidly unforgiving piece from Owen Jones (Whatever Scots decide the old order is dead and buried, 8 September). The simple truth is that there are only 5.3 million people living in Scotland and over 56 million living in England. Scotland has 59 MPs and England 533. Even allowing for Wales's 40 and Northern Ireland's 18, English interests outweigh the rest - as they have done for centuries. Domination may not be as savagely exercised as it once was, but it's ever present.\n\nSo however much Cameron, Clegg, Darling et al prattle about a better together union of equals, population and parliamentary numbers indicate that if they triumph, Scotland will revert to being an afterthought. A yes vote make sense, as the imperative of shared interests will ensure independence brings a more effective alliance between the two nations than what is presently imposed by whoever is in power in Westminster. So other than those who can't bear to let go of what they have long held, relentlessly exploited and taken for granted, we will all be winners.\n\nJim Gillan\n\nHuddersfield, West Yorkshire\n\n* I hope the Scots vote yes, because I fear the consequences for northern England should Scotland choose to stay in the union. Scotland already receives more public subsidy per head than its prosperity deserves. Promises (bribes) now being made by all major party leaders will have to be paid for. Is it likely that grandiose spending and capital schemes in the south-east, the nation's so-called powerhouse, will be curtailed? No, the north, which contains many of the poorest areas in Britain, will pay the price.\n\nI wish an independent Scotland every success in creating a fairer society, should it choose to go, but English people should not support any further (expensive) devolution should Scots choose to stay.\n\nMike Mosley\n\nNorwich\n\n* If bribery in the form of the belated offer of greater \"devo max\" doesn't work let's try blackmail. Shares set to slump on independence (Report, 8 September), homeowners at risk of a price crash, crisis worse than eurozone if Scotland votes yes. Some extracts from recent press. I hope my fellow Scots won't let these shoddy tactics dissuade them from voting yes.\n\nDugald MacInnes\n\nLondon\n\n* Please do not separate Scotland from England. For us, Scotland and England are one. Both Scotland and England will suffer economically. When nations in Europe are banding together to make a bigger market, separation will reduce both economically and politically. Logistically there will be problems. It is a bit late don't you think after 300 years? If you want to protect certain things you can negotiate for autonomy in certain areas. Don't say yes to independence.\n\nDr S Sudarshan\n\nBangalore, India",

A simple majority (50 per cent plus 1) wins. If more people vote Yes than No, Scotland would become an independent country.\n\nWHO CAN VOTE?\n\nEligible voters include Scotland residents who are 16 and older and are British citizens; qualifying Commonwealth citizens; or citizens of a European Union member state. More than four million people have registered as voters.\n\nWHO ARE THE LEADERS?\n\nIn May, 2011, the Scottish National Party won a landslide victory. Its leader, Alex Salmond, campaigned on a promise of a referendum on independence and voters gave the SNP the first majority government since the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in 1999. Along with the Scottish Green Party, they form the pro-independence side.\n\nThe Better Together pro-union campaign, led by Labour MP Alistair Darling, is a coalition founded with Scotland's Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Labour parties. The three main Westminster parties' leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron, have campaigned strongly in favour of union.\n\nSalmond and Darling have faced off twice in televised debates, the first of which was seen to favour Mr. Darling but the second going to Mr. Salmond.\n\nTHE SITUATION NOW\n\nScotland has had its own parliament since 1999. Currently, the Scottish government based in Edinburgh is responsible for health, education, justice, rural affairs, housing, environment and transportation. The U.K. government based at Westminster retains powers such as defence, security, foreign affairs and immigration.\n\nScotland could have one of several options for a post-independence currency:",

New polls show a recent shift in public opinion has suddenly made independence much more plausible. Here's a cheat sheet on what you need to know about Scotland beyond kilts, haggis & the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nThe Basics\n\nVoters in Scotland will face one simple yes/no question: Should Scotland be an independent country?\n\nA simple majority is needed to secure victory.\n\nIn the event of a 'yes' vote, the UK's parliament would pass laws that let Scotland kick off the process of becoming an independent entity. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has said he expects this complex move to be completed by March 2016, before elections.\n\nMeanwhile, a 'no' vote would bring no legal change. However, the Scottish parliament is widely expected to glean more power either way.\n\nPolling stations will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time (2 a.m. - 5 p.m. ET).\n\nThe electoral commission is expecting a high turnout of around 80% - roughly equating to 3.4 million people. Anyone who lives and is registered to vote in Scotland will be allowed to vote - including those aged 16 to 17. The deadline to register to vote was September 2.\n\nCitigroup economist Michael Saunders calls the race a \"statistical dead heat.\"\n\nThe Big Issues\n\nCurrency: Will the British pound remain Scotland's main currency? (The pound fell to the lowest level in 10 months on the latest polling data). Salmond says yes, but all three political parties in London have ruled out such a deal, saying it would expose UK taxpayers to financial risks.\n\nEU Membership: For Scotland to get back into the European Union would require a unanimous vote by all of the bloc's 28 member states, some of which may be wary of supporting separatism within their own borders. A former EU commissioner says Scotland would need its own central bank to be considered for membership.\n\nOil Money: 80% of Britain's oil reserves lie within Scotland's maritime borders, but how the reserves are divided up is still up for negotiation (plus it's getting increasingly expensive to produce oil & gas in the North Sea).\n\nContagion: Eurasia Group's Ian Bremmer warns it could be a domino effect for similar situations in Europe (i.e. Catalonia in Spain).\n\nUK Leadership: Should Scotland decide to end its 300-year union, there may be great pressure for British Prime Minister David Cameron to resign. He, however, has dismissed the idea.\n\nFamous Scots for Scottish independence (\"Yes\"):\n\nSean Connery The Proclaimers\n\nFamous Scots against Scottish independence (\"No\"):\n\nJ.K.

That would, of course, involve radical change for Scotland. But what would it mean for the rest of the United Kingdom?\n\nThe most obvious symbol of the unity of the United Kingdom is the Queen. On the occasion of her Silver Jubilee in 1977, when devolution appeared to be in the offing, she referred to Scottish aspirations in her reply to addresses from both houses of Parliament. \"I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors,\" she declared, \"and so I can readily understand these aspirations. But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and of Northern Ireland. Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of the United Kingdom.\" That was widely perceived as a warning to those who sought to break up the realm.\n\nThe Queen has made no similar pronouncements during the referendum debate. Newspaper reports speculate that she is distressed at the prospect of break-up. But, constitutionally, there is nothing she can do to prevent it, for she can speak and act only on the advice of her United Kingdom ministers.\n\nIt is possible, but unlikely, that Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, would ask her to make a speech in favour of the unity of the kingdom. She would be loath to do this, since the leitmotif of her reign has been a determination to avoid being drawn into political controversy. It is only on that basis that she can remain Queen of all of her people, rather than Queen of those who happen to hold a particular political view.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, if Scotland were to become independent, it proposes to retain the monarchy, and the Queen would not want to antagonise the rulers of her new kingdom. The likelihood, therefore, is that Her Majesty, will suffer in silence until the referendum is over.\n\nBut, if there were a \"yes\" vote, the rest of Britain would be unlikely to suffer in silence. There would likely be outrage against the politicians who have so mismanaged the campaign as to dissipate the 60-40 \"no\" lead of a month ago.\n\nThe most obvious scapegoat would be the Prime Minister. It is he who would be blamed for allowing the pro-independence bandwagon to gather momentum, rather than calling a referendum immediately after the SNP victory at Holyrood in 2011; for not insisting upon a devo-max option in the referendum (that is, enough additional devolution to allow Scotland control of many of its own affairs); and for the wording of the question: \"Should Scotland become an independent country?\" rather than \"Do you want Scotland to remain a part of the United Kingdom?\"\n\nSome have argued his credibility would be so damaged he could not continue. But his resignation would solve little. Cameron, therefore, would probably stagger on, but his credibility would be gravely diminished, and he would be landed, however unfairly, with the soubriquet of \"the prime minister who lost Scotland\". He would become a political cripple.\n\nBut, whoever is prime minister, it would be difficult for a ministry that had lost so much credibility effectively to represent the rest of the United Kingdom in the post-referendum negotiations with the Scots. The Government might be pushed into calling an early general election so that a fresh administration could be chosen, one that would be in a stronger position to negotiate; or the coalition could disintegrate, forcing an early election.\n\nBut, in the next parliament, whether chosen this year or next, the 59 Scottish MPs would be temporary tenants whose residence would end in March 2016, the First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond's deadline for independence. If, therefore, a Labour government were to be elected, dependent on Scottish votes, the political colour of the government of what remains of the United Kingdom would also alter in 2016. Perhaps another general election would be needed at that point, the first in the new United Kingdom without Scotland. Two general elections in such close proximity might excite the political commentators. They would be unlikely to make for economic stability.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that Scotland's exit would make it more difficult for Labour to form a government. But this should not be exaggerated. Scotland's exit would mean Labour would need a swing of a further 1 per cent to form a government - annoying but not unmanageable.\n\nBut, of course, a \"yes\" vote would damage the leader of the opposition Ed Miliband's credibility at least as much as Cameron's. Scotland, after all, is a Labour stronghold, and most of the key figures in the No campaign have been Labour grandees. If there have been errors in the campaign, these are as much the responsibility of Labour as of the Conservatives.\n\nThe truth is that a \"yes\" vote would discredit the British political class, just as the expenses scandal did. The vast majority of English voters, many of whom have relatives in Scotland, would bitterly regret the loss of Scotland and would blame the politicians as a whole, not just those of one particular party. The main beneficiary, therefore, would be the party whose raison d'etre is opposition to the political class: Ukip, a party that appeals to a sense of Englishness, rather than Britishness.\n\nEnglishness has always been difficult to define. In his novel The Tragic Muse, Henry James makes his hero feel \"the sense of England - a sort of apprehended revelation of his country\", which \"laid on him a hand that was too ghostly to press, and yet somehow too urgent to be light\". In the event of a Scottish exit, Englishness is likely to become rather less ghostly and somewhat more urgent. A Scottish exit might well unleash the hitherto slumbering force of English nationalism.\n\nThat could make life difficult for an independent Scotland. Much of what Salmond hopes for in the proposed post-independence negotiations, such as currency union and his ill-defined \"social union\", depend crucially on English goodwill. Such goodwill might be a commodity in distinctly short supply if Scotland votes \"yes\" on September 18.\n\nThe most likely long-term effect of a Scottish \"yes\" vote is a swing to an English nationalist government in the rest of the United Kingdom, a government determined to drive a hard bargain with Scotland in the post-independence negotiations under the tight timetable Salmond proposes - precisely the opposite to the prospectus the separatists are offering. And there is a Chinese saying to the effect that the man with the tightest timetable also needs the deepest pocket.\n\nThe odds still remain in favour of a \"no\" victory. But a \"yes\" vote would have seismic consequences for England as well as for Scotland. - The Daily Telegraph\n\nVernon Bogdanor is Professor of Government at King's College London.",

                    "body": "LONDON: An opinion poll showing Scottish independence campaigners have a slim lead nine days before a crucial referendum has highlighted reasons for the wider world and investors to pay heed to the Sept. 18 vote, which could see Britain lose 5.3 million Scots.\n\nForeign governments and financial markets had long assumed Scots would view independence from the United Kingdom as too risky a leap but the sudden swing, confirmed by another survey showing the two camps neck-and-neck, has exploded such complacency.\n\nLosing Scotland would likely weaken Britain as a power, dent its self-confidence and make it more introverted, increasing doubts about its future in Europe.\n\nBREXIT\n\nA lot of energy has been expended arguing whether an independent Scotland could join the European Union. The European Commission said on Monday it stood by its position that Scotland would have to leave the EU and re-apply for membership.\n\nEven more telling could be Scotland's absence from the debate about whether the rest of the country should remain part of the bloc, on which Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to give voters the final say if he is re-elected next year.\n\nOverall, Scots are far more pro-EU than the English and if they secede in 2016 they would not get a say in the proposed 2017 referendum on Britain's place in Europe.\n\nWithout Scotland, the chances of England, Wales and Northern Ireland voting to leave the EU are greater. Scots may only account for around 4 million of the UK's 45 million voters but with opinion finely divided, that could tip the balance.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said in June the UK would be stronger and more robust if it stuck together and Washington has made abundantly clear it wants Britain to stay in the EU.\n\nScottish nationalist (SNP) leader Alex Salmond says the biggest threat to Scotland staying in the EU is Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out EU referendum.\n\nPOLITICAL INSTABILITY\n\nScottish independence would also alter the calculus for national politics in the rest of the country.\n\nThe opposition centre-left Labour party has 41 members of the Westminster parliament in Scottish seats while the centre-right Conservatives have only one. Take those out of the equation and the path for Labour to win power looks daunting.\n\n\"In Britain, it will mean the end of any chance of Labour winning power,\" former Labour Europe minister Denis Macshane wrote on The Globalist website this week.\n\nWhichever way the Sept. 18 referendum goes, Scots will still vote in a British general election next year, raising another uncertainty. If Labour won, its government might lose its parliamentary majority and fall within a year once its Scottish lawmakers go.\n\nThat loops back to EU membership since the Conservatives are committed to holding a plebiscite while Labour is not.\n\nThe irony is that the Conservatives have traditionally been the strongest defenders of the union and many would be aghast at independence even though it gave their party a permanent electoral advantage in what is left of the United Kingdom.",

                    "body": "Ignore the fantasists - oil and gas will not provide the basis for a New Jerusalem.\n\nAs has been argued previously on spiked, the narrow discussion about the economic future of Scotland under independence has rather missed the point about the nature of the question being asked in the referendum on 18 September. If Scots have a strong, principled desire to separate from the rest of the UK, for political, cultural or any other reasons, then the fact that Scotland may be slightly worse off or slightly better off should not be an issue. But given the fantasies of some proponents of independence, the economics are worth examining.\n\nAs The Economist has pointed out, working-class Scots (especially young men) are more likely to favour independence than their well-to-do compatriots. Given that working-class Scots rarely get to influence major political decisions, this is clearly seen as an opportunity to flex their political muscles, to register their disaffection from the political status quo. But according to the pro-independence campaign, Yes Scotland, an independent Scotland would also be 'a different country with different priorities', in the words of one campaign organiser. There is an assumption that an independent Scotland would be more left-wing than the UK, with higher public spending than now. No wonder union leaders north of the border are among the loudest advocates of a 'Yes' vote.\n\nAccording to the Scottish National Party's John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, the UK government has failed to share the proceeds of economic growth equitably: 'One particular feature of Scotland's economic growth within the UK to date has been the failure to spread the rewards of growth more fairly across society.' As a result, many have assumed that an independent Scotland would be more redistributionist than the UK government has been, and they are voting for independence in that expectation.\n\nThere is no reason to assume that any and every future Scottish government will be more generous. Independence merely grants Scots the right to vote for a parliament in Edinburgh - it doesn't automatically follow that Scots will always vote for left-leaning parties. Moreover, the SNP hasn't much of a record on redistribution of wealth, according to former Labour MP Brian Wilson: 'Scottish nationalism is not a progressive force. I have repeatedly asked for one example of a redistributive policy which the SNP has adopted during its seven years running Holyrood, and I am still waiting for an answer. Like every nationalist movement, it tries to cloak itself with the dignity of social justice - but its performance is of the centre-right, keeping the middle classes happy. That is how it would continue. When the money ran out, the poor would still be waiting.'\n\nWhat would Scotland's economy be like, post-independence? The Scottish economy is pretty similar to that in the rest of the UK. It is well developed by global standards, with areas of dynamism like oil exploration (not just in the North Sea), food and drink (particularly whisky), medical research and computer games. The finance sector is strong, too, but some of the biggest companies may take flight or downsize their Scottish operations if there is a 'Yes' vote.",

Befuddled, she watches a clip from 1997 of the Spice Girls performing at an awards ceremony. \"What's that lady wearing?\" she asks, pointing at Ginger Spice. You reply: \"Darling, that is a dress made from the Union Jack flag. It was the old flag for Great Britain, when Scotland was united with England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It's a very old flag; it's not used anymore.\"\n\nFanciful future hypotheticals aside, Great Britain now finds itself at a moment pregnant with historical significance but lacking the bloodshed and war-waging typical of events we call \"history.\" The Sceptered Isles face a point of existential reckoning that many thought would never come. On September 18, the people of Scotland will be asked to answer one question: Should Scotland be an independent country?\n\nIt is an ancient question, battled over \"thro' many warlike ages,\" as Scotland's favorite son, poet Robert Burns, wrote more than 200 years ago. It is a question weighted with issues of sovereignty, identity, realpolitik, ideology, and money. But on the day of the Scottish independence referendum, this complicated question will be stripped of nuance and answerable in only one of two ways in the ballot box: Yes or No.\n\nSorry everyone -- Scotland is not the world's new cocaine capital. Read more here.\n\nFor the first time, and to the surprise of politicos and pundits, the most recent YouGov poll has put the Yes to independence campaign ahead of the No by two points (51 percent to 49 percent). Polls are imperfect predictors, and it's worth noting that another polling company, Panelbase, still has the Better Together (No) campaign ahead 52 percent to 48 percent. If I were putting money on it, I'd probably take my cue from gamblers. The British betting exchange Betfair still gives the unionists a 72 percent chance of victory. Referendums are unruly beasts to predict, but I imagine that come September 18, the status quo of the United Kingdom will prevail.\n\nI hope I am wrong.\n\nIf I were facing the terse binary posed by the referendum, my answer would be Yes, Scotland should be an independent country. But I support Scottish independence in a manner appropriate to the reductive nature of a yes/no referendum. Most simply, I support a nation accessing its own sovereignty. It is an imperial archaism that a country's primary legislature remains based outside of its borders.\n\nSir Walter Scott made this very point in 1707 when two parliamentary acts united the kingdoms of England and Scotland. He wrote, \"I ken, when we had a king, and a chancellor, and parliament -- men o' our ain, we could aye peeble them wi' stones when they werena gude bairns -- But naebody's nails can reach the length o' Lunnon [London].\"\n\nIn short, and updated: The people of Scotland have less power to influence and hold accountable a government based in London than one based in Scotland.\n\nIt is an imperial archaism that a country's primary legislature remains based outside of its borders.\n\nReferendums are blunt instruments. They don't address the work of hashing out a detailed picture of independence should the voters choose Yes, and they don't explain what continued unity should entail in the wake of an impressive but failed push for independence. The final run up to the vote is steeped in emotion; such is the nature of national identity. But what about, to borrow from the Scottish Play, \"when the hurlyburly's done, when the battle's lost and won\"?\n\nIf Scotland emerges independent, the banalities of governance in a world of global capital will soon supplant any utopian dreams of freedom and independence. (And the Queen will remain Scotland's monarch -- some archaisms just won't budge). Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, will not oversee Scotland's swift transition into an egalitarian socialist otherworld, fed comfortably by North Sea oil, \u00e0 la a Scandinavian petro-state. Scotland is no Norway; it has no vast sovereign wealth fund. And Norway is no paradise either.\n\nThe kicker, too, is currency, as the unionists are emphasizing in their campaign's final throes. Haunted by the lessons of the Eurozone, the Governor of the Bank of England has made clear that a currency union in which Scotland could continue using the pound would not be an option. It's a fiscal \"Fuck you\" from England's central bank, as a fiscally independent Scotland would likely struggle to gain access to capital markets without any history of debt issuance. These are the vagaries of nation statehood in the globalized world; they have little regard for Celtic spirit.

Read more here.\n\nMuch of the separatist campaign has admirably articulated a rejection of neoliberal British politics, stretching back to Margaret Thatcher, through New Labour, to Cameron's austerity assault on Britain's social safety nets. Perhaps the best part of the Yes campaign has been the way it has said \"No\" to the current politico-economic order. And, while Scottish independence would remove Scotland's valuable leftist contingent from Westminster, the presence of these politicians in England has done little to mitigate Britain's rampant inequality, overseen by an elitist and corrupt corporate-parliamentary nexus in London. I share the Yes campaign's grim diagnosis of modern Britain, but I don't think they have the antidote.\n\nI'm no statist. And I think nationalisms of any variety are problematically and inherently based on systems of inclusion and exclusion. But the possibility of Scotland breaking from its 300-year-old union carries a message of independence beyond any dewy-eyed nationalisms. The referendum is a reminder that independence from a political status quo is possible.\n\nIt was, after all, a woman wearing a Union Jack dress who urged, \"Spice up your life!\" When the Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Seafield, signed away Scotland's sovereign independence in 1707, he said, 'There's ane end of ane auld sang.' There's the end of an old song. The fight for Scottish independence should rouse the orchestra again, not necessarily to blare \"Flower of Scotland,\" but to play a powerful dirge for neoliberal hegemony.",

                    "body": "David Whitney of Aberdeen, Scotland, plays the bagpipes near Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament\n\nWith a vote on whether Scotland should declare itself an independent nation only eight days away, now is a good time to reflect on how we arrived at this point. Both sides will be using all the emotive imagery at their disposal as the campaigns enter the final stretch. So it is helpful to separate fact from fiction.\n\nThe First Scottish War of Independence, popularized by Mel Gibson in the film Braveheart, is probably the first image that springs to mind when people think about Scottish nationalism. However, the current debate over sovereignty has little in common with the state of affairs in the 13th century.\n\nThough it may be tempting to imagine the cause of Scottish nationalism simmering for generations under the yoke of British oppression before bursting forth in the modern day, the events of the intervening centuries warn against such a simplistic reading. While the proximate cause of hostilities in the First Scottish War of Independence included an ill-conceived invasion of the country by an English King looking to assert his authority, the vote today is set against the backdrop of over three centuries of (reasonably) amicable relations between the two countries.\n\nIndeed the wars that are likely to bear most heavily on the results are those between 1914-1918 and 1939-1945. As this gentleman illustrates, support for the Union is strongest among the over-50s in Scotland in large part because either they fought, or are the children or grandchildren of those who fought together, with the rest of the U.K. in the two World Wars. Their vote could prove critical if the vote is as close as the polls suggest.\n\nAlthough Scottish poet Robert Burns's claim that \"We are bought and sold for English gold. Such a parcel of rogues in a nation\" remains popular among some nationalists, the Act of Union owed as much to calamity as coercion. What drew the two nations together was in large part the failure of the Darien Scheme, where Scotland had attempted to emulate the trading success of the English East India Company by establishing a colony called \"Caledonia\" in what is now Panama.\n\nThe scheme was heavily backed by Scottish nobility, and its failure, due to poor planning, disease and misfortune, wiped out the equivalent to 50% of Scottish GDP, causing a financial crisis. Their perilous position as well as the promise of Scottish access to English trade routes provided a base of support for a union of the two nations -- although there remained a large faction resolutely opposed. The treaty was finally signed in January of 1707 by 110 votes to 69.\n\nWhile contemporary Scottish nationalists may claim affinity with the 69 dissenters, the fact that the union held firm speaks to its success in gaining general acceptance. Historians will no doubt see it as somewhat ironic that the legacy of a financial crisis brought the two nations together, and the fallout from another threatens to drive them apart.\n\nAnd what the vote really is about:\n\nAfter the Conservatives swept to power in 1979 the reforms they undertook to increase the competitiveness of the British economy put them on a direct collision course with the labor union movement. The two came into direct conflict during the 1984-5 miners' strike where police were sent in to put down the pickets of workers fighting to preserve a coal industry that was under threat of closure across Britain.\n\nScottish miners were heavily involved in the dispute, joining their English and Welsh peers on the picket lines in huge numbers. If the strike was a galvanizing moment for the miners, its ultimate failure checked the progress of the labor union movement and sent it into decline.\n\nWhat had brought people together from all sides of Britain descended into general antipathy for the Westminster government and a tangle of local grievances. As Tolstoy reminds us in Anna Karenina, \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\"\n\nThis rumbling discontent resurfaced in 1989 when the Conservative government made a fateful decision to introduce the Poll Tax, a flat rate tax that ignored individuals' income, raised to pay for local government. Anyone who failed to pay the tax forfeited their right to vote. The poll tax was introduced a year earlier in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The country erupted in protest at the perceived injustice, with many Scots believing they were being treated as guinea-pigs for the new tax.\n\nAfter that, Scottish support for the Conservative Party matched the labor union movement in falling into inexorable decline. After having returned 22 Scottish Conservative MPs in the 1979 general election, the party lost over half of them through the 1980s. It now boasts only a single MP from the country. (There is a popular joke that Scotland has more pandas in Edinburgh zoo than Conservative MPs.)\n\nYet despite their unpopularity in Scotland, the Tories continue to enjoy a solid base of support across the rest of Britain and are the larger partner in the current Coalition government. The pro-independence campaign has played on this to suggest to Scottish voters that independence would mean chucking out the Tories for good.\n\nFor some Scots at least, that logic will be compelling.\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) has had a rocky road to the referendum. Having been founded in 1934 from an amalgamation of the Scottish Party and the National Party of Scotland, the SNP had to wait over a decade to gain their first seat in parliament -- before losing it two months later in a general election.\n\nIt was not until the 1970s that the party really began to hit its stride. The party won 11 seats in 1974 and looked set to continue to grow. However, a combination of a Conservative Party landslide victory in 1979 and the failure to convince 40% of Scots to vote Yes to a Scottish Assembly in the same year wiped the party out as an electoral force.\n\nDespite its setbacks, the modern day party re-emerged from obscurity, re-invigorated in 1990 under the leadership of one Alex Salmond. Conscious of the successful \"Tartan Tories\" line of attack on the party by the left-wing Labour Party in previous years, Salmond moved to modernize the SNP positioning them as economically and socially progressive and pro-European.\n\nThe call for an independent Scotland, however, has remained its organizing principle.\n\nAfter the Labour Party delivered on its campaign promise of a Scottish parliament in 1999, the SNP won 35 seats and sent six MPs to Westminster. That made it the largest opposition party, but was not enough to overturn Labour's majority in Scotland. They also suffered a shock with the resignation of Salmond as party leader the following year.\n\nHis equally surprising return as leader in 2004 marked a turnaround for the party, however, and it won its first majority in the 2007 Scottish election by a single seat. Although Labour were heavily favoured to overturn that in the 2011 election, the SNP managed to increase its share of the vote and secure another stunning victory.\n\nA consistent theme in the SNP story is the repeated underestimation of their political acumen and their ability to last despite repeated setbacks and periods of severe internal divisions. They have thrived by fashioning themselves as the underdogs committed to getting the best deal for Scotland - and have succeeded in wresting powers away from Westminster using the threat of independence as a bargaining chip.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Scottish independence vote marks the highest stakes challenge yet. The outcome of the vote will decide Scotland's future for the next 100 years, and will see the realization or the destruction of the dream upon which the SNP was founded. As they learned after the 1979, a loss could throw the party into obscurity for years, decades or, perhaps, even longer.\n\nFor the SNP electoral machine to find itself in the unusual position of being the incumbent power in Edinburgh will require a new tack. Independence is no longer just an ace in Salmond's pocket, it's now the ship of state onto which they will have to set sail. Whether the Scottish people are ready to follow them onto it, sink or swim, remains highly uncertain.\n\nBut as has become the SNP way, the odds of a shock result on the 18th are narrowing.",

Earlier polling gave the \"no\" vote a comfortable double-digit margin, according to the BBC.\n\nThe news troubled the financial markets on Monday, causing the British pound and shares in some Scottish firms to fall.\n\nIn response to the uncertainty of the nation's future, UK Chancellor George Osborne offered to sweeten the pot by promising a plan to give more power to Scotland's government if voters turn down independence.\n\nIf Scotland votes to leave the union, consisting of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the ripple effects could be far-reaching.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron said the country's security could be compromised if Scotland goes, according to the Daily Mail, and the opinion was reiterated by the head of spy agency M16, according to the Scotsman.\n\nThe UK government also warned that Scottish independence risks the Scottish economy, and an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the British pound as its currency.\n\nScotland's athletes may not be able to participate in the 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro in 2016. And there are questions about issues such as currency, border security and governmental debt.\n\nCraig Reedie, the vice president of the International Olympic Committee, worried \"there would not be enough time between Scotland's target date for independence of March 2016 and the start of the 2016 Games to ratify a new national Olympic committee,\" according to the Guardian.\n\nThe Scottish government in Edinburgh painted a rosy picture of what independence would mean in a paper titled Scotland's Future: Your Guide to an Independent Scotland.\n\n\"The most important decisions about our economy and society will be taken by the people who care most about Scotland, that is by the people of Scotland. ... If we vote no, Scotland stands still,\" it claimed. \"A once in a generation opportunity to follow a different path and choose a new and better direction for our nation is lost.\"\n\nScotland and England have had an uneasy and sometimes bloody relationship through the ages. The kingdoms have been united since the Acts of Union in 1707, though they shared a monarch as two distinct kingdoms since 1603.\n\nIn 1999, Scotland was permitted to seat its first parliament in 300 years, the BBC noted.\n\nWill Hutton of the Guardian wrote in heartbroken tones of the possibility of Scotland breaking away: \"If Britain can't find a way of sticking together, it is the death of the liberal enlightenment before the atavistic forces of nationalism and ethnicity - a dark omen for the 21st century. Britain will cease as an idea. We will all be diminished.\"\n\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown, himself a Scot, blamed the separation fervor on the growing pains related to globalization in an opinion piece published in the New York Times on Friday.\n\nOn Monday, Brown announced he has established a timetable for boosting home rule starting on the day after the vote if the referendum is rejected, and shadow chancellor Ed Balls vowed to transfer more financial power to the Edinburgh parliament whenever the Labour Party is again in power, the BBC reported.\n\nFor some, the last-minute attempts to appease the populace is too little, too late.\n\nIn an opinion piece in the Guardian, Deborah Orr said the choice is invigorating to Scots, whose needs she said have been long ignored.\n\n\"It's between being an active citizen and a passive one,\" she wrote. \"It's between having an opinion that will be heeded and having one that's been taken for granted all along.\"",

He told MPs a Scotland Bill would be published by the end of January next year, and introduced after the May general election regardless of which party wins power.\n\nHe said the bill would show that \"Scots can have change without irreversible separation and without risks to jobs and their future\".\n\nMs Harman welcomed his comments, but stressed the need for further devolution to Wales and the cities and regions of England.\n\nMr Hague replied by saying the government had made good progress on this already, and added that plans were afoot to devolve further powers to Wales.\n\nScottish National Party MP Pete Wishart - whose party is leading the Yes campaign in Scotland - said the vote would be the most \"historic\" and \"momentous\" decision for Scotland, and said the Scottish people should be congratulated for the way they have conducted the debate over the country's future.\n\nMr Hague agreed they should be applauded \"for taking such an immense interest on all sides\", but added: \"I don't congratulate those such as his own party who have failed to be straight with the people of Scotland\" about currency and economic matters.\n\nBob Russell, a Lib Dem member of the Commons Defence Committee, said it believed a yes vote would pose \"serious security and defence risks for a separate Scotland without the capacity to defend itself\". Mr Hague agreed, and told MPs it would \"put at risk the security of all of us\".\n\nRecent opinion polls have suggested the referendum race is now neck and neck.\n\nScotland First Minister and SNP leader Alex Salmond has dismissed the efforts of the three party leaders to keep Scotland in the UK, suggesting their primary concern was keeping their own jobs.",

Communities are realising the power of making their voices heard.\n\nWhat a contrast to the miserable scaremongering of the No campaign - which, we are told, even saw supermarket bosses summoned to Downing Street yesterday so David Cameron could pressure them into saying prices would rise in an independent Scotland.\n\nDespite Westminster's efforts, we've seen a flourishing of national self-confidence.\n\nIt's this revival in Scottish confidence that tells me we'll make a great success of an independent Scotland.\n\nAfter all, the case for Yes is based on the firm belief that the best people to take decisions about Scotland are the people who live and work here.\n\nNo one else will do a better job and no one else cares as much about our country.\n\nSo we need to take this sense of empowerment forward and ensure we make the most of all the talents of everyone who lives in Scotland.\n\nSurely it's time to say goodbye to the days when decisions about our lives were made by remote Westminster governments - often, like now, Tory-led governments that we didn't even elect.\n\nWhen the Tory PM jetted up to Scotland for a day-trip on Wednesday he said he would be heartbroken if we voted Yes.\n\nWestminster politicians talk about \"losing Scotland\" as if we were some sort of possession.\n\nBut it isn't Mr Cameron's heartbreak at losing his right to govern Scotland I'm bothered about. It's the heartbreak of the parents having to bring their children up in poverty because of the Tory Party's policies that should concern us.\n\nWith a Yes vote, we'll always get the governments we vote for.That means we can stop paying towards the \u00a3100billion cost of a new generation of nuclear weapons on the Clyde and invest in childcare instead.\n\nWe can protect our National Health Service from the impact of Tory privatisation.\n\nThe No campaign is a joint Labour-Tory venture.\n\nSouth of the border, Labour are rightly warning about the Conservatives' privatisation of the NHS.\n\nThey say there's an increase in charging for care and they say another few years of Tory rule will destroy the values of a publicly run and owned health service.\n\nAnd Labour MPs in Scotland, unions and others are warning about the knock-on effect of Westminster health cuts on the budget for health here.\n\nSo despite what Labour leaders are saying during this campaign, the Labour Party itself has made it crystal-clear that the Tory threat is real.\n\nWith a Yes vote, we have control of our budget. That means it won't be George Osborne making the decisions about funding for our public services. We can protect ourselves from the fall-out from Tory privatisation by taking control of our finances.\n\nAlthough there's clearly disagreement between the Yes and No campaigns, there's actually a big area where we agree.\n\nEveryone now accepts that we are one of the world's richest countries. Business paper the Financial Times says we'd be among the 20 wealthiest countries per head in the world - ahead of the UK.\n\nSo the great issue is not whether Scotland is wealthy enough to be independent. It's why so many people in Scotland don't feel the benefit of that wealth.\n\nThe result of decades of Westminster decisions is that the gap between rich and poor is among the highest in the developed world.\n\nNo one on the Yes side says independence is a magic wand. It isn't. Of course there will be challenges to face and we won't succeed overnight.\n\nBut we'll be equipped with the powers, if we use them well, to build a better country.\n\nThis day 17 years ago, Scotland was waking up to a new era - we'd had the confidence, despite the warnings and scares, to vote Yes to the Scottish Parliament.\n\nNow, 17 years on, often because parties have worked together, Scotland is a better place. It's accepted that in education, in health and in housing, it's better for decisions to be made in Scotland.\n\nSurely if we've collectively shown we're the best people to take decisions in these important areas of life, then we're the best people to take decisions about our economic policy, taxes and social security system.\n\nIn an independent Scotland we'll have full control of job-creating powers. That means any future government - whether SNP or Labour - will be able to tailor economic policy for our needs.\n\nFor Westminster, London and the south-east of England will always be the economic powerhouse so it's inevitable they'll direct jobs and investment there.\n\nBut with a Yes vote, for the first time ever we'll have control of an economic policy with full powers so we can put job-creation in Scotland first.\n\nAlmost everyone in Scotland will know of friends or family who have had to leave to get a job or to further their career.\n\nIn fact, nearly 40,000 people aged 16-34 leave Scotland every year.\n\nBy having job-creating powers - such as offering companies incentives to invest here - we can create more and better local jobs and help keep families together.\n\nMore and more people in this campaign are finding out about Scotland's wealth and are waking up to the opportunities we'll have with a Yes vote to use economic powers to make the most of that wealth.\n\nThat's one of the main reasons people are switching from a No vote to a Yes vote.\n\nBut recognising the danger to them of this great upsurge in Scottish self-confidence, the response of the Westminster elite has been clear: they've decided to put Scotland back in its place.\n\nThe scare stories have been ratcheted up. Such is their desperation at the rise in Yes support, the UK Government have broken strict rules by leaking financially sensitive information about RBS in an attempt to frighten Scottish voters.\n\nYesterday was the No campaign's Mons Meg moment - their attempt to fire their biggest cannon.\n\nInstead it just blew up in their faces.\n\nBut the Yes campaign had a Canon of our own - Canon Kenyon Wright, one of the founding fathers of our Scottish Parliament.\n\nAnd yesterday - on the 17th anniversary of the referendum which delivered a resounding Yes vote, Kenyon put it better than anyone.\n\nHe said: \"I know the powerful will say no - I believe the people will say Yes.\"",

I can still hardly believe it, but I think Scotland is going to vote for independence.\n\nIt is possible that there will be a last-minute swing towards the status quo, which happened in the Quebec referendum in 1995, and also in the UK general election of 1992.\n\nOr we could trust to the \"wisdom of crowds\". TNS also asked what people thought the final result would be, and the answers were: No, 45 per cent (including 25 per cent of Yes supporters); Yes, 31 per cent (including 11 per cent of No supporters); Don't know, 24 per cent.\n\nBut I realise that this is wishful thinking.\n\n2. Extraordinarily, blame is already being handed out, confidently, mostly by people who were confident until last week that Scotland would vote to stay in the UK. It was all Tony Blair's fault, for having started down the slippery slope of devolution. It was all David Cameron's fault, for having allowed Alex Salmond the referendum, or for rejecting a third option (of further devolution) on the ballot paper. Or it was all Ed Miliband's fault, because the Labour Party in Scotland is useless and many Labour voters have recently switched to separatism. The only usual suspect who hasn't been blamed is Nick Clegg, because everyone has forgotten about him (although he did replace Michael Moore with Alistair Carmichael as Scottish Secretary, for no good reason). This is all pointless as well as mistaken.\n\nIf the Scottish people want separation, they should have it. That is sad, but it is all there is to it. Blair could no more have resisted the \"settled will of the Scottish people\" (which was then for devolution) than Canute could have resisted the tide. Once the Scottish National Party had won a majority in the Scottish Parliament in 2011, it would have been quite wrong for Cameron to have denied it a referendum. Nor could he have dictated the question. Oddly enough, it was Salmond who wanted a three-option ballot, and he was overborne by Nicola Sturgeon, his deputy, and John Swinney, the finance minister. As for Miliband, Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown and the rest: what magical powers were they supposed to exert?\n\n3. If the Scots do vote Yes, I disagree with them. There is nothing that Scotland gains by independence that it doesn't have now. Which is why Alex Salmond had to retreat on everything. Scotland will keep the Queen, the BBC, membership of Nato and the EU and will even try to keep the pound.\n\nThe only thing it will gain is control over its own destiny, which I think is defined as losing the subsidy from the Treasury and gaining the power to put up its own taxes. (That would be the power to vary income tax by up to 3p in the pound that the Scottish Parliament has had since devolution in 1997 and never used.)\n\nScotland also loses something by independence, and the rest of the UK loses it too. As Chris Deerin put it yesterday, we lose a shared identity, a shared history and a shared strength.\n\nBut I don't live there, so it's not up to me.\n\n4. One consequence of Scotland's separation is that the rest of the UK will become slightly more Conservative. Yesterday, Lord Ashcroft and Populus published polls giving Labour a seven- and a two-point lead in Great Britain respectively.\n\nIf we exclude Scotland from the figures, Labour's leads become six points and one point.\n\n5. To try to cheer up my fellow melancholics (as a southern Scot you can tell me from a ray of sunshine), I bring you thins from Just Jan, who notes that someone had a slow day at work.\n\n6. Finally, a young person I met yesterday disagreed with Ed Miliband's claim that his generation will be worse off than his parents:",

                    "body": "A \"Yes\" vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum would radically reshape politics on both sides of the British border -- and it's now looking like it might happen.\n\nUntil recently, the \"No\" campaign enjoyed a comfortable lead in the polls. Few people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland fully appreciated the impact that a Yes vote could have on the face of British politics. As that lead is fast evaporating, perhaps it is time they did.\n\nIf Scotland leaves Britain, it will reshape Britain completely, turning it into a country with virtually permanent Conservative Party control of the government in Westminster.\n\nYet another poll released Monday showed the Yes and No campaigns are neck and neck heading into the final stretch before the September 18th vote. It provides further support to findings in previous polls showing the pro-independence camp gaining momentum and will no doubt continue to weigh on financial markets, which have finally woken up to the risk of breaking up the union. The pound is already being sold off in international currency markets.\n\nWith the prospect of an independent Scotland looming ever larger left-leaning voters in Britain also have something to worry about, however. A vote to break up the union would see the Labour Party lose its 41 Scottish MPs, meaning the hurdle for the party to gain and maintain a majority could be about to get much higher.\n\nTo put this problem in perspective: Of the 11 Labour-led administrations since the 1920s, only six would have been likely without Scottish MPs. Indeed without Scotland, Labour could have been in power only once in the first half of the century.\n\nThe implications for the future balance of politics in the rest of the UK if Scotland leaves is stark. As Anatole Kaletsky makes clear in his latest column for Reuters:\n\nWhether or not [Prime Minister David] Cameron could survive defeat in the referendum, a huge constitutional challenge would loom in May 2015, when a general election must be held in the U.K. as a whole. Scottish independence would shatter the democratic legitimacy of whatever government emerged from this election. If Labour won a majority, its victory would depend on Scottish MPs due to be expelled from Westminster at the end of the independence negotiations in 2016 or 2017. A Labour-led government elected next year would therefore have no democratic mandate.\n\nThe loss of the majority pro-European Scots would also put pressure on future Conservative governments to put Britain's membership of the European Union to the popular vote, one that ever louder eurosceptics voices within the party would be confident of winning. Not only could this threaten Britain's commercial interests, which would do little to improve the country's worrying trade deficit, but it might also be taken as a signal of a broader isolationist approach to global affairs.",

Are we allowed to remain British? Or do we have to swear allegiance and take the nationality of where we live?\n\nWill we be entitled to State Benefits from where we reside and by that I mean Pensions, as well as\n\nSocial Security benefits? If we take Scottish nationality, will the million or so Scots living abroad be entitled to welfare benefits and pensions from Scotland and would a new Scottish economy be able to manage that?\n\nIt has been made clear by the President of the EU that an independent Scotland would have to apply for membership and that on the present basis they would not qualify.\n\nEven if they have their own currency, to which Mr Salmond says no, it would take some 5 years to gain acceptance.\n\nWhat happens in the interim period?\n\nThink carefully you EU citizens living in Scotland and able to vote in the referendum, you may be sending yourselves back home.\n\nAssuming Salmond achieves his objective of keeping the pound sterling, a currency managed by the Bank of England, how will the Scots manage their finances, set their budgets, raise capital, borrow funds etc, without it first being approved by the English?\n\nIncidentally one of the qualifications for EU membership is to have your own currency, unless of course Scotland becomes like Gibraltar and effectively a protectorate of England who have to voice any concerns through the Parliament in Westminster - where they would no longer have any representation.\n\nHow will Scots living in other Countries get their Passports renewed, temporary ones issued if they are lost, or Visas granted? The British Embassy is British, not Scottish and as far I am only aware the SNP have been told that Embassies will not be shared with foreign powers!\n\nWill a Scottish Pound be accepted outside of the UK? You have to remember that there already is a Scottish Pound, several in fact and all privately issued by various Banks.\n\nThere have been issues with this for years, some shops South of the Border do accept them, others do not.\n\nWill Scotland have to have border controls? i.e you will need to take your Passport every time you leave Scotland and queue up at the border.\n\nNo say the SNP, yes says Westminster.\n\nIn fact if Scotland is not a Member of the EU, then England would have little option but to put border controls in place, as would every other Country in Europe.\n\n80% of Scotland's trade is with England. 20% of England's trade is with Scotland.\n\nThat is going to be one big queue at the border and if import taxes are imposed, I dread to think of the consequences.\n\nAs the UK is one of the few remaining Countries driving on the left, will the SNP take advantage of cheaper EU and USA cars by changing from left hand drive to right hand drive and will we all have to switch sides of the road once we have passed the border guards?\n\nThe mind boggles.\n\nI left my Country with regret, and have been welcomed in England, but the reality was that I could not get a job in Scotland.\n\nThe shipyards were the only considered future for anyone West of Glasgow and they were all closing.\n\nThe once glorious Costa del Clyde has been turned into a retirement ghetto without ambulant facilities and ambition was something that others did.\n\nCan someone convince me that things are better?\n\nFrom my frequent visits home I can see little change.\n\nThe same boarded up shops, the same queue at the brew and nobody has convinced me of the great boom in the economy predicted by the SNP.\n\nScotland and England have too much to lose from this idealistic separation.

He was born in Scotland and immigrated to Australia with his family as a ten-year-old.\n\n\"Even 20 years ago I couldn't see the day Scotland would separate from England,\" he said.\n\n\"There's been a strong nationalist movement for many years.

But he hoped a close vote would place pressure on the British government to more seriously consider ways to decentralise governmental powers.\n\n\"I think England and Scotland would survive but I think neither would do quite as well politically or economically separately as they could do if they worked better together,\" he said.\n\nBurns Club president Athol Chalmers was in Scotland last month and said the visit had strengthened his engagement with the debate.\n\nMr Chalmers, who was born in Australia to Scottish parents, said he hadn't formed a strong opinion on independence but had heard a number of arguments for and against.\n\n\"I haven't really formed my own view,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of [the debate] is around things like can they economically sustain themselves if Scotland becomes independent, what happens to the currency, and what happens with things like their own defence force, the membership with the European Union. The other side is obviously arguing, we can be a bigger and better nation in our own right if we are independent.\"\n\nAs president of the Scottish Australia Heritage Council, Malcolm Buchanan said his organisation encouraged all eligible voters to cast their preference and would support either outcome.\n\nBut personally, the Scottish descendant favoured independence.\n\n\"Scotland, being a large territory and a sizeable community with a different cultural influence, should be allowed to manage its own affairs,\" he said.\n\nMr Buchanan said he was concerned about the initial divide the referendum's result might trigger and how Scotland's break from the UK would be negotiated if successful.\n\nHe expected a sizeable number of undecided votes and adolescent votes to shape a close outcome.\n\n\"This isn't a mandatory vote, it's a voluntary vote - and that will very much depend on the Scottish weather,\" he laughed.",

It looks like being a close-run thing - so close, in fact, that David Cameron, the Prime Minister, is getting quite emotional.\n\n\"I love my country more than I love my party,\" he said, telling the Scots that he would be \"heartbroken\" if they left the UK.\n\nIt is hard to tell if the appeal will have the intended effect, or if Scottish voters will rub their hands at the prospect of leaving a Tory Prime Minister heartbroken.\n\nHis party's popularity is at an all-time low, and its Scottish vote has fallen steeply for more than six decades.\n\nBack in 1950, the Conservatives got half of the vote. This year, they got 17.2% of it in the European election. That was probably boosted by a low turnout - they scored 13.2% in the 2011 Scottish parliamentary elections and have just one Scottish MP at Westminster.\n\nThe Tories are a diminished force in Scotland compared to England and Wales. In fact, Alex Salmond, the SNP leader and Scottish First Minister, has used the prospect of continuing to be ruled by a Tory government in Westminster as one of the main planks of his campaign for voting for independence. Yesterday, even Mr Cameron warned voters not to be tempted to vote for the irrevocable step of independence just to give the \"effing Tories\" a kick, as they might in a general election.\n\nLabour, traditionally the strongest party in Scotland, was overtaken in the SNP landslide of 2011, and the prospects of winning some of these lost Labour voters back may be damaged by their association with the Tories in the No Campaign - at least, that is what the SNP hopes.\n\nNo campaigners tell me that the key demographic on which the poll may hinge is Labour voters of Irish descent in areas such as Glasgow, Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and West and East Dunbartonshire. It is that close.\n\nCaution - Cameron's line of not taking an irrevocable step whose effects would last for a century or more - is the No campaign's main hope to win back these marginal voters in the final days.\n\nThat appeal will be accompanied by a timetable for the devolution of taxation and welfare powers to Scotland if they vote No.\n\nThis \"devo max\" package, it will be argued, will provide something like home rule for Scotland - without the risks of going it alone.",

                    "body": "Once upon a time, a long while ago, I lived in Dublin. It was a time when everything seemed possible and not just because I was younger then. The country was stirring too. When I arrived it was still the case that a visa to work in the United States was just about the most valuable possession any young Irishman or woman could own; within a fistful of years that was no longer the case. Ireland was changing. These were the years in which the Celtic Tiger was born. They were happy years of surprising possibility.\n\nYears later I lived in the United States and my perspective changed. Scottish independence seemed, viewed from there, about as useful or meaningful as independence for Texas. Not impossible or even necessarily undesirable but somehow missing the point nonetheless. But that was later. When I lived in Ireland, Dublin's example seemed, well, exemplary. If the Irish could do it, why couldn't we? More to the point, why shouldn't we?\n\nSo, like many other Scots who will vote No next week, I don't think independence a daft notion or some kind of fatuous affectation. I think there is a reasonable case for it (even if this is not the case that, during this long campaign, has often been the case that has actually been made). Could we do it? Why, yes we could. But should we?\n\nOf course the detail matters. It matters even if you accept that the Scottish government's prospectus for life after independence is only one of many possible futures none of which can be decided until independence is achieved. There are many voters - well, perhaps one in five - who would vote for independence even if it promised an impoverished future. Similarly there are many voters - perhaps one in five - who would reject independence even if they believed it offered a more prosperous future.\n\nStill, if we're to vote on independence it should be done on the basis of a moderately honest prospectus. No such prospectus has been offered by the Scottish government. A lot of people are voting on the basis of a deeply cynical and meretricious set of promises that simply cannot, not even when assisted by great dollops of wishful thinking, be delivered. It is not possible to spend more, borrow less and tax the same.\n\nThat, however, is what the SNP propose. Lower borrowing rates, 3% annual increases in public spending and no changes to the overall level of taxation. It is incredible. It supposes that voters must be glaikit and easily gulled ninnies who can be persuaded to swallow anything, no matter how fanciful it must be. A nonsense wrapped in a distortion inside a whopping great lie.\n\nIt's quite possible that the realities of life in an independent Scotland might push the country's centre-of-political-gravity to the right. Quite possible, then, that an independent Scotland would be more likely to produce more of my kind of politics than some of the politics imagined by the keenest advocates for independence. That still strikes me as a thin and selfish reason to vote for independence.\n\nBut, sure, many of the details could be worked out and it's certainly possible that after an initial period of some difficulty Scotland would emerge as a decently prosperous and contented country. It needn't be a disaster and it probably wouldn't be. Nevertheless, the growing pains would be acute and I think it best to recognise this. There will be short and even perhaps medium-term pain but the long-term prize will be worth it.\n\nThat's not what's being sold, however. Far from it.\n\nThere are other difficulties. The dishonesty of suggesting - or allowing it to be understood - that there's no functional difference between sterlingisation and a monetary union with whatever remains of the UK is, in the end, breathtaking. Yes, Scotland can \"use the pound\" but how it's used is a question of some importance.\n\nI know politicians can never say they don't know the answer to something but there are times and places when pretending you have all the answers is worse than admitting the obvious truth that you don't. This is one of those times; one of those places.\n\nBut, look, in the end this is still process stuff. Very important process stuff but still only process stuff. I happen to think it provides ample reason to vote No but it's not why I'm voting No.\n\nI'm voting No because the campaign has surprised me. It's made me think about my country and, more than that, what it means to be a part of that country. I'll vote No even though I think Scotland would do fine as an independent country.\n\nBecause, even more than the economic sleight-of-hand, I've been taken aback by the dishonesty of a campaign that claims you can end the United Kingdom as we know it but retain almost everything about the United Kingdom that actually makes it the United Kingdom.\n\nLike everyone else I've been asked to believe that independence will improve relations between the constituent parts of this kingdom and that, far from ending a kind of Britishness, it will actually enhance your sense of Britishness. The Yes campaign has said you can lose your country and keep it too. I don't believe that.\n\nYou know how it is at a funeral: there is a hierarchy of grief and it is unseemly to pretend you're closer to the epicentre of loss than is actually the case. The same is true of difference and \"foreigners\". No parts of these Atlantic Isles are truly strangers to one another. But there is still a hierarchy of difference. England and Wales are not so foreign as Ireland. Ireland is not so foreign as New Zealand or Australia. Which in turn are less foreign than Canada. And Canada is not as foreign as France or Belgium or Sweden or even bloody Norway.\n\nIndependence won't sever all those bonds. Of course it won't. The hierarchy of difference will remain in place. But the gaps between the layers will increase. Scotland and England (and Wales and even Ulster) will drift apart. We will be less close than once we were; we will not become strangers but we will know less about - and be less interested in - each other. Never foreign-foreign but foreign enough for it to count and be noticed.\n\nAnd I think that would be a sad business. I think Alex Salmond gets something very wrong when he says that England would lose a \"surly lodger\" after independence and gain a \"good neighbour\". Because I don't think of Scots as lodgers paying rent in someone else's house, granted a bedroom and the use of the lounge three nights a week. I think we live in our own house. A house we built ourselves. Salmond asks us to move to another, smaller, house and that's fine but he does so while pretending we can continue to live in our old house too. But we can't.\n\nI'm Scottish but I'm British too and I've been surprised by the extent to which that latter layer of identity still matters to me and still has something to say, not just about me, but about all of us. I don't recognise the caricature of England (and it is usually England, not the rest of the UK) offered by Yes supporters. They see a heartless, rapacious, profiteering \"neoliberal\" dystopia; I see a relaxed, liberal, ambitious, open-minded, multi-racial, modern country.\n\nThey see the rise of UKIP and are frightened by it; I see UKIP as a bug not a feature because the feature is the manner in which the UK is open to the world and, actually, quite happy about that thank you very much. A UK in which, despite its difficulties, has managed the transition from a white country to a multi-racial polity with, in general, commendable ease. They see a broken, sclerotic, unreformable Britain; I see a cosmopolitan country that's a desirable destination for millions of people around the world.\n\nOf course there are difficulties. There always are and always will be. Britain can no more solve every problem than could an independent Scotland. Which is why, again, this debate - for me anyway - isn't about policy but instead about something bigger: who we are.\n\nThe other day the historian Tom Devine remarked that all the Union has going for it is sentiment, family and history. Like that's not enough? Those aren't wee things, they're the things that make us who we are. The blood and guts, the bone and marrow of our lives. The tissue that connects us to our fellow citizens, the stuff that makes us more than an individual. The things from which you build a society. You can have that in Scotland, alone and independent, too of course. But we also have it in Britain, right now, and we will lose some of that if we vote Yes. Or some of us will, anyway.\n\nSo I think of E Pluribus Unum and I think that's a motto that applies to the United Kingdom too. And so does its opposite: within one, many. There's ample room for many types of Britain. Not just Scots and Welsh and Irish and English but Pakistani-Scots, Jamaican-Welsh and Nigerian-English too. I think it's the tensions and ambiguities inherent in all of this that makes Britain interesting; that makes Scotland interesting too.\n\nNuance and complexity matter and have some value. They have helped make us what we are. I like that at Waterloo the Scots Greys, part of the Union Brigade, charged into the French lines to the cry of Scotland Forever. I like our ambiguous, sometimes ambivalent, often ironic, past. I like our present too and I have some small hopes for our future as well.\n\nPerhaps this is romantic, sentimental, tosh but that's an inescapable part of national identity. An unavoidable part of the business of constructing a nation. That's true of Scotland just as it's true of Britain too.\n\nHere's the thing: Scotland is different from England but it is not separate from it. Nor from Wales or even Northern Ireland either. I like the fact I have two countries. I like the fact that one includes Jerusalem, Men of Harlech and the Londonderry Air as well as Annie Laurie and the Flowers of the Forest. That one offers Larkin and Thomas and Heaney as well as MacDiarmid. I like that these belong to all of us even if they each belong a little more to some of us than they do to the rest of us.\n\nI see this as a country greater than the sum of its constituent nations. Whatever remains of the United Kingdom after Scottish independence will do just fine. Scotland, likewise, is not doomed. We can, all of us, make a decent fist of things. But it will not be the same and the idea everything must change so things can remain much the same is a con.\n\nIf history matters - and I think it does just like sentiment and family matter - then whatever this place's shortcomings and mistakes it's worth recalling that it's also the country of William Wilberforce and Alan Turing as well as Adam Smith and Thomas Paine. That should count for something. We are different but not separate. I think of it as being like the relationship between Boswell and Johnson. They complement one another. You may even think they complete one another. There'd be a smaller Johnson without Boswell but a lesser Boswell without Johnson. They improved each other.\n\nMost of all, I like that when you get the train to Scotland from London or Peterborough or Newcastle north and you cross the border in the gloaming you feel your heart soar and you cry hurrah and yippee because you know you're home now without having been abroad. I like that and think it matters. I don't know if I know why it does or why it suddenly seems so valuable but I know I do. But that's the Britain I know and like; a place in which I'm always Scottish but also, when it suits, British too. A country where you travel to very different places and still always come home without having been abroad.",

                    "body": "Alarmists must let Scotland decide\n\nSIR - I find some of the letters in your paper warning against the future for Scotland and the UK should the Scots vote for independence extraordinarily alarmist.\n\nI personally feel we should all support Scotland's decision if its people vote for independence.\n\nI especially take issue with Mr CN Westerman's assertion that all nationalists are isolationists, and that sooner or later some nationalists come into conflict with other nationalists, resulting in violence etc.\n\nIs Mr Westerman saying that he does not believe in democracy, and the right of an historic race of people, in this case Scots, to choose self-determination and self-rule if they so decide?\n\nIt is this sort of irrational thinking that would allow the global elite's Orwellian vision of one global state to prevail, whereby we shall all live under one global government, with one army, one police force, one global currency, one set or laws and rules etc.\n\nWell that would surely be fantastic, some might argue, and would surely end all wars, but of course that utopian vision relies upon the all important assumption that our masters would be a caring and honest lot, and honour our democratic rights if we were not happy with them.\n\nFrom all I have read of the plans of the elite, the opposite is almost certainly true, and the majority of us would have traded liberty and self expression in return for security and slavery. Just look at the Brussels model, an early experiment from the elite to see just how much its citizens will tolerate before rebelling to see what lies down the road if we don't reverse the trend now.\n\nTherefore, I would say to the inhabitants of Scotland, if your heart and head says Yes, go for it, and remember a key part of Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg address from a time when his land was still a torch bearer for democracy, namely \"this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".\n\nR Terry James\n\nBrentwood, Essex\n\nPeople have right to decide their destiny\n\nSIR - I passionately believe in people's right to take control of their own lives. Scottish people are fed up with seeing a deteriorating health service year on year, of continuing cuts in welfare benefits, the Bedroom Tax, the ever-growing gap between and rich and poor; while the cost of nuclear weapons and Nato spirals out of control.\n\nWhy should Scotland have the largest nuclear submarine fleet in Europe against the express wishes of its people?\n\nThe Westminster parliament has for too long taken Scotland's loyalty for granted.\n\nI am proud to have been asked to speak in support of Scottish independence outside the Senedd on September 13.\n\nSome Welsh politicians in the Assembly say it will mean a lifetime of Tory government.\n\nI say that is defeatist talk. When Scotland achieves its freedom, it will make Westminster think twice before inflicting their wretched policies like the 'Poll Tax', the 1972 Fair Rents Act etc, which brought so much misery to Welsh people.\n\nNo matter which way the vote goes, the British political world will be changed forever.\n\nIt will also make us in Wales think very positively about our own future.\n\nSo a huge thank you to Scotland and Alex Salmond.\n\nBecause of their courage, their people will have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a nuclear free future, with all that means for Wales, Britain and the world.\n\nTake it, cherish it, and enjoy your new freedom, Scotland.\n\nRay Davies\n\nBedwas, Caerphilly\n\nThings will change, whatever happens\n\nThe unthinkable has become a distinct possibility ,and all it needs now is for Corporal Jones to run about shouting \"Don't panic\".\n\nIt is remarkable how the referendum campaign in Scotland has concentrated minds.\n\nUntil the recent opinion poll, in which the \"Yes\" faction were shown to have a narrow lead, the degree of complacency on the part of the Westminster Government has been incredible. We are still left in some doubt what it intends to do if the Scots decide to leave the Union.\n\nIt is plain that the state formerly known as Great Britain and Northern Ireland will no longer exist with all the changes which will invariably follow.\n\nOne of your contributors was wrong to say that Alex Salmond framed the question.\n\nHe wanted a third \"Devo Max\" option which was was rejected by David Cameron.\n\nI hope the Union continues, but I can fully understand the disaffection with it.\n\nWe do not live in a fair and just society. The gap between the \"haves\" and the \"have nots\" has been widening.\n\nWhether this would be remedied in an independent Scotland would remain to be seen. Independence in Ireland did not eliminate poverty and class difference.\n\nWhich ever way the vote goes, things will be different.\n\nThe old certainties which enabled us to tell others what to do will disappear.\n\nOur present politicians, while pontificating over the events in the Ukraine and Iraq, will have presided over one of the greatest political train wrecks in the history of these islands.\n\nH Thomas\n\nNeath Abbey\n\nYes vote will lead to a more equal society\n\nSIR - How narrow-minded your contributors David Woosnam, CN Westerman and Brian Christley (letters 9 Sept) are in their comments towards the forthcoming Scottish Independence referendum.\n\nIt would appear that they, like the Better Together campaign, have just woken up and are panicking.\n\nThis argument on nationalism was rolled out and directed at me once people discovered I am a member of Plaid Cymru.\n\nI simply reply that the aspirations of both us Welsh and Scots do not reflect what went on in Europe in the past.\n\nThey clearly do not understand the feelings of people in Scotland, that, as a nation, it has a right to decide its own future, whether that be as an independent sovereign state or not.\n\nAll three of them allude to the fact that past influences in those European countries, either before or after the two world wars, have any bearing on the present feeling of peoples who are seeking independence or more autonomy in their respective countries i.e. Scotland, Wales and those regions of England which seek more devolution in their affairs.\n\nThe difference being that the rise of so-called nationalism in parts of Europe prior to the World War One, and after leading up to World War Two, was really imperialism in large.\n\nIt does not resemble in the slightest what is happening in the present-day Britain.\n\nLest we forget that the biggest \"nationalist\" imperialist nation-state of them all was in fact this \"Great Britain\", which rampaged over most of the world creating the British Empire, enslaving and subjugating those conquered peoples.\n\nNaturally, of course, the resources of those countries were soon removed to feed the ever greedy English/British State.\n\nSooner or later those people rose up and said enough is enough, we want our freedom.\n\nThey now form the Commonwealth.\n\nThe biggest danger to how relationships are between the peoples of the British Isles after the referendum is the narrow-minded, negative, nasty and vindictive stand taken by the pro-unionist lobby who threaten Scotland, if they vote \"Yes\" the pound sterling will be withdrawn from Scotland.\n\nAlso, what business or firm which has threatened to leave Scotland if a \"Yes\" is recorded would sincerely do so since Scotland is such a wealthy country and there is a great deal of business to be done?\n\nThis scaremongering by the unionists is an own goal, since it has caused all this uncertainty in exchange rates, leading the pound to devalue and for billions to be wiped off shares.\n\nI sincerely hope the people in Scotland will vote Yes, leading to a fairer and more equal society.\n\nBrian Thomas\n\nMerthyr Tydfil",

There will also be calls to revive the so-called Barnett formula - a Treasury mechanism for dividing spending that means Scotland people get more public money per head than the English.\n\nDespite fears among some in the no campaign that the Ukip leader's appearance in Glasgow could antagonise voters, Farage said Ukip had a distinctive and valuable argument to make in Scotland.\n\nHe told BBC Good Morning Scotland: \"We did win a seat in the European parliament Scotland, and we do have a voice. I can assure you that I have no intention of being incendiary at all, but I do want to make an argument that nobody else has made in this campaign, that this referendum is not about independence.\"\n\nHe said Scotland would not be truly independent by voting yes because it would seek to join the EU and be run from Brussels.\n\n\"What is unarguable is that you cannot call yourself an independent nation if you are a member of the European Union,\" he said.\n\n\"There are Labour voters who have switched to the yes side because they are contemptuous of the Westminster system who are being sold this vision of a self-confident, self-governing Scotland and that is simply not the case.\"\n\nHe described a currency union as \"politically impossible\".\n\n\"If George Osborne was to give Scotland membership of a new economic and monetary union and was to face a general election next year, having acted as a guarantor for Scotland's financial industry ... and say by the way the there is no tax take, then I that is no politically impossible.\"",

Since the beginning of August, week by remorseless week, the No campaign's poll lead has narrowed to the extent that Alex Salmond and independence campaigners are now as close as they could have hoped to breaking the British state and winning independence for Scotland.\n\nWe have long predicted that the outcome would be close and have been aghast at the complacency of the Westminster elite, for whom the standard line about Scottish independence was: \"It just won't happen.\" Labour said something similar in the run-up to the 2011 Scottish election, when the Scottish National Party overturned a double-digit lead and won resoundingly. That victory set us on the road to where we are today.\n\nDavid Cameron has from the beginning of negotiations been outmanoeuvred by Mr Salmond. His refusal to allow for a multi-option ballot could well prove to be a fatal error, with dire consequences for his premiership.\n\nThese are desperate days for the Prime Minister, who is struggling even to keep his own party together. It is hard to recall a significant contribution from him to the referendum campaign, beyond a single speech, delivered in February to a near-empty velodrome at the Olympic Park in east London. Mr Cameron has been rendered virtually mute by the decisive defeat of Conservatism in Scotland. To paraphrase Charles Kennedy: Margaret Thatcher did more for independence than any Scottish nationalist. Her party's toxic legacy could yet be the break-up of Britain.\n\nHowever, it is not the failure of the Tories alone that is powering the nationalist surge. There has been a huge loss of trust in Labour and, according to the YouGov poll that so unnerved the British establishment, most Scots of working age now support independence. As our pro-independence blogger Jamie Maxwell has long predicted would happen, low-income Scots are abandoning Labour and falling in behind the Yes campaign. The anti-politics mood in the country at large - which the likes of Nigel Farage and Russell Brand have channelled so effectively - is also contributing to the collapsing authority of the old, established parties.\n\nWhat we have been witnessing in Scotland is a nation's democracy renewing itself, as Jason Cowley writes on page 22. The national conversation has been sustained and animated. Scots of all ages, classes and backgrounds are asking themselves fundamental questions about identity and purpose. Who are we? What kind of nation do we want to be?\n\nMeanwhile, the debate has scarcely registered in England until these past few days - perhaps because people there are disenfranchised and have no say in an outcome that will affect all our lives. It is as if the 307-year-old Union could end with barely a shrug of indifference from the English.\n\nYet all of us who live in these islands should be grateful for the democratic flourishing in Scotland because the complacent and smug London elites - political, financial, media, bureaucratic - are finally being forced to take notice.\n\nWe believe that the Union of the nations of these islands is indeed worth preserving. In an age of globalisation and in a world that seems ever more dangerously unstable, we believe in the virtues and benefits of cross-border social solidarity and in the pooling of resources. We believe in the great institutions that we have built together and that define us as British: the NHS, the welfare state, the BBC, the armed forces.\n\nYet the British state - with its unbalanced economy, its inflated property market, its corrupt House of Lords and quasi-feudal structures of land ownership - cannot continue in its present form. The United Kingdom deserves to survive, but only if it can be reconfigured as a federal or quasi-federal state, which entails also addressing long-held English grievances.\n\nGordon Brown's proposal of \"home rule\" for Scotland is one we welcome. But at this late stage, it feels unavoidably cynical; a bribe to stave off full independence. It also raises constitutional issues, including the status of Scottish MPs in the UK parliament and the feasibility of further devolution to Wales and Northern Ireland. That many in Westminster are only now considering these questions is further evidence of their bewildering indifference.\n\nEven if Scotland narrowly votes No, the question of independence will inevitably recur; the unionist side has long believed that only a large, double-digit win would prevent a \"neverendum\". After years of neglect, the onus will be on Westminster to prove that it deserves more than a temporary reprieve. Unless our political class demonstrates the kind of enlightened and creative statecraft that has been so lacking in recent times, the greatest multinational state in modern history remains destined for break-up.",

In the letter, Barroso sets out the Commission's position on whether an independent Scotland would remain part of the 28-nation EU.\n\n\"If part of the territory of a member state would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the (EU) treaties would no longer apply to that territory,\" Barroso said, meaning an independent Scotland would no longer be part of the EU.\n\nHe pointed out however that any European state which met the EU's membership criteria may apply to join the EU.\n\nNegotiations could take years\n\nAsked whether an independent Scotland would have to apply to join NATO, a NATO official told Reuters that no discussions had been held on the issue and no decisions have been taken.\n\n\"However, it appears widely agreed that, as a matter of law, a Scotland which has declared its independence and thereby established its separate statehood would be viewed as a new state. A new state would not be a party to the North Atlantic Treaty, and thus not a member of NATO,\" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\n\"If it were to choose to apply for NATO membership, its application would be subject to the normal procedure,\" he said.\n\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond, leader of the pro-independence campaign, has dismissed suggestions that an independent Scotland would struggle to join NATO if it removed Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent from Scotland as planned by 2021, or be refused membership of the EU.\n\nNegotiations to join the EU and NATO can take years.\n\nBarroso weighed in to the Scottish referendum debate when he told a BBC television interviewer in February that states breaking away from existing EU countries would struggle to gain EU membership.\n\nAll EU states would need to back the membership of any new country that emerged from a member state, he said.\n\n\"It would be extremely difficult to get approval of all the other member states ... I believe it's going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible,\" Barroso said.\n\nSecession is a sensitive subject for several other countries that have regions seeking to form their own states. Spain is wary that a vote for Scottish independence might encourage separatists in its Catalonia region.\n\nSalmond said in April that if Scots chose to break away from the United Kingdom, he expected it would be possible to negotiate EU membership before a formal declaration of independence in March 2016.",

                    "body": "First, what will Scottish independence mean for the economy both north and south of the border? There appears to be two contrasting viewpoints. If you support independence, then Scotland's natural assets, such as its oil and gas reserves, combined with a relatively small population will make a new, standalone Scotland significantly better off. If you oppose independence, you can point to Scotland's ageing citizens and its relatively small GDP as evidence that any split would be economic suicide. So, in a nutshell, nobody has a clue.\n\nBut there is a third economic option - nobody knows what the economic ramifications will be, so stop patronising the Scottish population by making crap up in order to gain influence at the polling station. And by the way, since when do economic issues matter when it comes to national statehood?\n\nNext up is the infuriatingly annoying debate about 'Brand Britain' and the impact of Scotland heading off into the horizon. As usual, the country brand claptrap should be ignored. The United Kingdom is not a brand, it's a sovereign state. While there are huge implications for all of us if Scotland leaves the Union, they're best not debated through the inappropriate prism of branding theory. Smarter, more experienced political types have advanced debates on this issue so let's not sully it with superficial theories derived from selling chocolate biscuits.\n\nThe only real debate of any value over the next week is what a vote for independence will mean for Scottish brands. Now that's an interesting and valid question as we head into this fascinating referendum.\n\nOn the plus side, it's unarguable that independence will make Scottish brands stronger. The process of voting and the subsequent global debate about Scottish independence will generate thousands of media stories about all things Scottish. You can't go wrong if you're a Scottish brand and you are the number one story on CNN.\n\nEqually positive will be the effect of Scottish independence on brand image. That's because one of the classic sources for brand associations is provenance. While Scotland has always been seen as a separate part of the UK, its independence will bolster that country of origin effect and potentially build its appeal. Combine this stronger brand image with more brand awareness and you begin to see why brands such as Glenmorangie or Highland Spring would prosper more in an independent Scotland.\n\nBut there are brands that face a specific and disastrous conundrum should independence occur. Take the Royal Bank of Scotland. At face value it's clear that the bank's allegiance should lie north of the border. But there are two major snags. First, the British have bailed out the bank and own the majority share. Second, an institution the size of RBS could suffer mightily if Scotland becomes independent and faces a protracted period of instability as questions related to whether Scotland should be allowed to keep the pound or join the European Union are bashed out in the financial markets.\n\nAccording to BBC economics editor Robert Peston, RBS has already made provisions to move its headquarters south of the border and essentially become an English bank in everything but name should the independence movement emerge triumphant next Thursday.\n\nAnd apparently RBS is not alone. Other major Scottish financial services brands face the existential choice of being true to their provenance and experiencing significant volatility in their share price and customer retention as a post-independence fog descends, or head south and face the equally intimidating threat of becoming an \u00e9migr\u00e9 brand that appeals to neither the rejected masses of the rest of the UK populace or a Scottish market now steadfastly loyal to the brands that stayed with them in their finest hour.\n\nSo ignore the rhetoric about economic impact: nobody knows. Forget the bullshit about the United Kingdom brand, it's superficial and irrelevant. The big question is how many of Scotland's big brands will sell their souls for safety if the people vote 'Yes'.",

If this comes to pass, no one should weep for them.'\n\nSir John's remarks, in an article in the Times newspaper today, come amid growing panic among senior Labour figures over the prospect of independence.\n\nThe party would lose more than 40 MPs, potentially depriving it of the chance of a Commons majority after the next election.\n\nBut a vote for Scottish independence would be 'disastrous' for the whole of the United Kingdom and not just Labour, Sir John said.\n\nIn a second impassioned plea to Scots, in an interview on the BBC this morning, he said Britain would be 'diminished' on the world stage.\n\nHe told Radio 4's Today programme that the United Kingdom was 'the most successful union' in history but would be badly damaged without Scotland.\n\nHe said: 'I am desperately concerned at what is happening. We would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect - morally, politically, in every material aspect - if Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were to part company.\n\n'This year is the 100th anniversary of the First World War. As we honour the people who fought together then, would it not be extraordinary if the SNP broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world?'\n\nSir John said that young Scots considering casting a vote for independence in next week's referendum would find themselves living in 'a very different country' over the coming decades if there was a Yes vote.\n\n'There is easy assumption that Scotland will be waved into the European Union. Well, maybe after a period of years that's possible but it's not certain. Spain for example wouldn't welcome a separatist nation,' he said.\n\n'There is the belief they are going to be able to get into Nato. Why would Nato let them in when the SNP propose to wreck the Trident independent nuclear weapon?\n\n'If Britain lost Trident it would have lost what has shielded it and protected it for a long time - including Scotland.\n\n'For that to be done by the enemy would be a disaster, to have it done by friends is almost unbelievable.'\n\nSir John said that the lose of the Trident nuclear deterrent - which is currently based in Scotland - would have consequences for the whole of the UK.\n\n'Our role in Nato would be reduced, our relations consequently with the United States would be damaged,' he said\n\n'The United Kingdom would be weaker in every international body it attends. We would lose our seat at the top table in the United Nations.'\n\nThe former premier - who warned 20 years ago that Scottish devolution would be 'the high road to separation' - was scathing about the SNP's inability to say what currency they would use if they did achieve independence.",

Today, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, his Liberal Democrat deputy, Nick Clegg, and Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, have canceled their planned appearances in Parliament, and will instead spread out to woo undecided voters.\n\n\"The right place for us to be today is in Scotland,\" Cameron wrote in an article for today's Scottish Daily Mail. \"The United Kingdom is a precious and special country. That is what is at stake. Let no-one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart.\"\n\nSince a Sept. 7 poll by YouGov Plc (YOU) put the nationalists just ahead, the world beyond Scotland has woken up to the possibility that the 307-year-old U.K. could break up. A second poll yesterday again put the two sides neck-and-neck. The pound has fallen, as have shares in businesses with large Scottish markets. A Yes vote would be the biggest crisis of Cameron's premiership. He has already had to deny he would resign if it happened.\n\nBrown's Return\n\nFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown broke years of silence to set out a timetable for the devolution of more powers over tax and welfare spending to the Scottish Parliament, if only Scots vote No. The move was agreed on by Labour, Tories and Liberal Democrats as necessary to swing things back their way.\n\nCameron will visit Edinburgh today, while Clegg goes to the Borders in the south. Miliband gives a speech in Glasgow, Scotland's biggest city and a heartland for his Labour Party.\n\nOf the three, it's Cameron, who has a Scottish surname and has vacationed in the country regularly, who has the closest ties. As a Conservative, he's also the leader of the least popular party there -- the Tories won a single Scottish Westminster seat of the 59 available in the 2010 election. Labour hold 40 seats.\n\nThree Englishmen\n\nClegg yesterday addressed the question of whether three Englishmen could sway the Scots.\n\n\"I can't dictate to anyone how to vote in this referendum,\" he told reporters last night. \"Of course, we have huge differences between our countries, but we can have those differences and still work together as a family of nations. I want to play my part in making that argument.\"\n\nNot all the omens for love-bombing of Scotland are good. At the first attempt to raise the Saltire over Cameron's Downing Street office yesterday, it fell down.\n\nIn Edinburgh the referendum battle is everywhere. At one end of the Royal Mile yesterday, Johann Lamont, leader of the Scottish Labour Party, was denying the No campaign was in panic. At the other end, nationalist leader Alex Salmond was posing for photographs with Scottish migrants who will be voting Yes. Even before Cameron's visit was announced, hotel rooms were thin on the ground. And the city is seeing something that had largely disappeared from Britain: open air politics.\n\nAmong the companies whose stock has dropped since the polls tightened is A.G. Barr Plc (ABG), maker of Irn Bru, a sweet orange-colored soda marketed under the slogan \"made in Scotland from girders.\" The company has 40 percent of its sales in Scotland, where Irn Bru is close behind whisky as a national drink.\n\n'Freedom!'\n\nLabour Party lawmaker Jim Murphy knocks back cans of the stuff as he tours Scotland making the case for the union. At each stop he climbs on a plastic Barr crate and addresses passers-by in the street. On Sept. 8 he was in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, \"campaigning for a patriotic No vote,\" as he told the crowd that quickly gathered.\n\n\"Freedom!\" heckled John Brechan, 44, a credit card salesman, as he walked past. \"It's our chance to break away,\" he explained. \"Freedom for the people!\"\n\nMurphy is used to it. At one stop he had an egg thrown at him. \"The nationalists have spent two years trying to turn patriotic Scots into Nationalist Scots,\" he told the crowd, his Irn Bru can in one hand and a microphone in the other.\n\n\"You can ask a question,\" he called out to Gemma MacFadyen, a recent graduate of the city's university, who was wearing a large pink \"Yes\" t-shirt.\n\n\"No thanks,\" she replied.\n\n\"Ah, that's how I'm voting as well,\" Murphy replied.",

                    "body": "In a week's time, Scotland will not hold a referendum about becoming independent. Everybody is describing it as such. But what is being voted on - and only by those who actually live in Scotland - is separation from England. Understand that and much that is otherwise inexplicable falls into place.\n\nThe SNP is the voice of anti-Englishness. Like Edward II, another English ruler, arrogant in certain victory, Mr Cameron has walked straight into a long-planned ambush. The year, carefully chosen by Mr Salmond, celebrates the one unequivocal Scottish victory in the long antagonism between the two nations, at Bannockburn in 1314.\n\nTo make matters worse, the PM himself precluded \"devo max\". The Scots have no way of keeping a UK link while extending the powers of the Scottish Parliament. I believe this option would have won the day but thanks to Mr Cameron, it is not on offer. The choice on the ballot plays into Salmond's hands: vote to stay subject to the English toffs at Westminster who stole their country under the threat of bankruptcy 300 years ago - the Act of Union - or vote to throw off the hated English yoke.\n\nThese terms make it pretty difficult for Mr Cameron to campaign in Scotland and my experiences confirmed this. The hoodlums who sought to break up my meetings and confined me to a pub told me to go back to England; to them, an Englishman should have no voice in Scottish political debate. Their position is merely the extreme end of Mr Salmond's.\n\nThe problem for the Scots, though, is if they vote ''yes'' next week, they will not get independence. Rather, they are voting for rule by Brussels. As Mr Cameron has brutally discovered, no EU member is truly independent.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNigel Farage: 'Brilliant Alex Salmond is Scotland's best political operator'\n\n09 May 2014\n\nNigel Farage to stage anti-independence rally days before Scottish referendum\n\n04 Jul 2014\n\nVince Cable: Ukip supporters could push Scotland out of the UK\n\n07 Mar 2014\n\n\"Better Together\" cannot, of course, say this. To do so would be to admit how little freedom of action the UK retains. A Scotland outside the UK, but in the EU, can no more have its own trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, environment or justice policies than any other EU member.\n\nThis is where Salmond has not been open with the Scottish voters: he is not admitting the consequences of EU membership. These have a direct impact on people's lives. The wage compression effect of open-door immigration turns the minimum wage into a standard or maximum wage: the immigrants or even just the threat of them ensure that millions of workers have no realistic chance of negotiating higher pay.\n\nBut, wages aren't the worst of it. The EU is run by the \"big battalions\" and one in particular - Germany. The euro, a currency union without a debt union which is pursuing unpopular austerity policies, is run largely to suit the interests of Germany. Angela Merkel is a clever operator but the policies of the eurozone are those needed to suit the needs of her German voters.\n\nEven Mr Cameron who represents, at least until next Thursday, a country of over 60 million people and a vital eurozone export market, has minimal negotiating leverage in the corridors of Brussels.\n\nThis is the issue that pulled me away from the City and into politics. As a trader, I will always be aware of the central role of currencies in all economies. This is where Salmond's thinking is most muddled and his comments most duplicitous.\n\nThe history of the development of money as it moves beyond coinage is about the links between currencies, banks and states. All currencies must have a lender of last resort. Sterling's long success and recent failures are all linked to the Bank of England having this role. No serious financial institution can be the lender of last resort without any control over taxation or spending. The Scots are deluded - and Salmond misleading them - if they think anything else: it just will not happen.\n\nIf the Scots do vote to separate then they will have to decide on a currency. Sterling, while genuinely independent, is not an option: it cannot be because of the role of the lender of last resort. The UK Government has ruled this out. Scotland could set up a new currency. But this would cause a flight of both capital and financial institutions that would hole the new currency below the waterline before it had floated off the dock.\n\nOr, they could join the euro and replace a relatively sympathetic Westminster and Threadneedle Street with a more distant Brussels and Frankfurt.\n\nThe Scots' rejection of the way in which Westminster operates is not unique to them. The English and Welsh feel it, too. Millions of voters are rejecting the entire British political class. Next May, at the general election, these people have a wonderful opportunity to express their discontent.\n\nMeanwhile, with the referendum polls so close, no one knows what will happen next week. But I do know that the Scottish electorate has been sold \"a pig in a poke\".\n\nThe vote is about secession from England and Mr Cameron epitomises all that the Scottish people viscerally loathe about England. The cunning and duplicitous Mr Salmond is using this to his advantage. But if they do vote to leave, I believe they will suffer a fate of which Aesop warned in one of his most famous fables. The frogs complain so much that Zeus replaces benign if boring \"king log\" with \"king stork\" who, you will remember, gobbled them all up!\n\nIf being part of the UK is the former, I think the Scots would find Brussels very much equates to the latter.",

                    "body": "\"Yes\" vs. \"Better Together\": Scotland's day to decide on the independence question draws near. The world will be watching.\n\nThe response of the London parties to opinion polls released last weekend, showing the pro-independence \"Yes\" side ahead for the first time in the looming Scottish referendum, was a panicky one. Even more powers were announced for the autonomous Scottish Parliament. On Wednesday, normal political business at Westminster was abandoned and the main political leaders headed north to act as persuaders for the Union. David Cameron gave a moving speech in Edinburgh. But there was more than a whiff of a cornered Bourbon monarch frantically improvising in a bid to head off an inflamed mob.\n\nIt is now hard to recall that just one month ago, the dreams of glory of Scotland's ruling Scottish National Party (SNP) appeared to be in shreds. In the first of two debates with his chief pro-Union rival Alistair Darling, the normally formidable SNP leader Alex Salmond gave a halting performance. As a separatist, he sounded bizarre when he insisted that \"We will take the pound as it belongs to Scotland as much as England, it's our pound!\" For Salmond, the British currency was an asset, rather than a means of exchange. He insisted on clinging to it, even though it meant ceding control of financial policy to the state that he was desperate to break away from. In polls and pronouncements, the British people and leaders of all the main parties had declared outright opposition. Yet, Salmond insisted on plowing ahead. He threatened (and still threatens) to renege on Scotland's share of Britain's national debt, unless his opponents embrace his quixotic financial union. This would freeze Scotland out of capital markets with stark consequences for the personal finances of probably most of its citizens.\n\nSalmond was generally judged to have lost badly in the August 5 debate. His side was thirteen percentage points behind pro-status quo \"Better Together.\" But instead of collapsing, his poll figures rose and they went through the roof following the second debate held on August 25 when Salmond offered a performance of undistilled populism. Before a heavily partisan audience and brushing aside an inept moderator, he virtually took charge of the debate. He insisted that the state health service was in danger of being privatized even though his own government controlled every aspect of it under the 1999 settlement, which had transferred a whole range of powers to the Edinburgh parliament formed in that year. Darling, along with numerous viewers was clearly horrified that the BBC had mismanaged such a crucial encounter. The questioning from the audience was overwhelmingly hostile, and he clung grimly to his speakers lectern as Salmond strode the debating stage as if he owned it.\n\nSalmond's great feat in these decisive weeks has been to neutralize the fear factor. To business chiefs with investments in Scotland and apprehensive national leaders from as far away as Australia and Canada, he appears to be a lord of misrule. His vision of a state-dominated economy in a country currently dependent on an economic lifeline from the rest of the UK, is unappealing. The fact that he doesn't appear to care that the currency his new state will have is still very much a mystery, is even more unsettling.\n\nYet, polls showed that a growing number of Scots were at ease with Salmond's Panglossian optimism. In large numbers and for many months, evangelical campaigners have been systematically working Scotland's streets, spreading a message of relentless optimism -- the people of Scotland are capable of meeting and confronting any challenge that is thrown at them because of the strength of their capabilities.\n\nBritain is depicted as an obsolete and failing country. But currently, the British economy, one with which Scotland is totally intertwined, ranks sixth in the world GDP league. Presuming that a 300-year union could be smoothly unpicked and that there would be no serious investment flight, an independent Scotland would be 42nd in world GDP rankings. One of the world' s most extensive public sectors would need to be financed from a tax base of under 4 million people instead of the present 52 million.\n\nIn Salmond's virtual reality, the rest of the world will fall into line and smooth Scotland's path to statehood. There is no inkling that leaders who fear the eruption of a eurozone-style financial crisis in Britain due to a run on assets and deposits in Scotland might instead seek to deter or even punish a Scotland seen to be in a grip of destructive hubris at a time when the world economy is still in intensive care.\n\nIt is not an analogy that the pro-Palestinian Salmond might enjoy, but probably not since the formation of the state of Israel in 1948 has such positivity gripped the architects of a would-be new state. Israel was taking shape in the wake of peculiarly terrible circumstances for the Jewish people. Scots, by contrast, have been part of one of the most successful economic and political unions in modern history. It has usually been marked by peace and prosperity. At hardly any other time have Scottish living standards been as high as they are now.",

A more fair society can't have all the power in one place. This is not just unfair, it is ridiculous.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the Scottish independence vote, more independence from Westminster will, I am sure, now be on the agenda for English regions, Wales and Northern Ireland in terms of more power to raise revenue and decide how it will be spent.\n\nHowever, it might take a little while for Westminster politicians to catch up with this trend that started way back in faraway colonies that did eventually get their independence: God bless America! It can take a while for some things to sink in: the English take a tad too much pride in a tradition that can hold us back while holding us together.\n\nVaughan Thomas\n\nNorwich\n\n* Discussions of the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence have been obscured by a fog of political mendacity and confidently presented spurious economics. There are two important points that have been ignored by many commentators. The first is that the Bank of England, despite its misleading name, is the central bank of the United Kingdom so that Scotland should have a part to play in the management of its assets, liabilities and operations.\n\nThe second is that the United Kingdom was formed by the union of two nations, England and Scotland, and the subsequent formalised unions with Wales and Ireland were with this United Kingdom, not with England. In the event of the primary union being dissolved, there would be no UK left because the political entity that Wales and Northern Ireland joined would have ceased to exist.\n\nPortraying the UK as a confederation of four equivalent components is probably incorrect, even if politically convenient.\n\nPeter Dryburgh\n\nEdinburgh\n\n* Deborah Orr is sad that an option for major reform of the union is not on the ballot in the Scottish referendum (Debate has intoxicated Scotland, 5 September), but it may be that that question really needs broader involvement of the people of these islands. The truth is that we don't really know what will happen if the Scots vote to break up the status quo. Anything is possible, as Osborne's comic rush to get reforms in place following single opinion poll putting the yes vote ahead: after years of being ignored in Westminster, the Scots can now shift policy overnight through an opinion poll. Who knows, if the yes vote in the next poll increases again we might find that it is possible to negotiate on Trident after all.\n\nWe don't know what will happen after a yes vote, partly because many in the no camp refused to contemplate any form of constructive engagement. The details of the future relationship between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom will take time to sort out: doing so will be the responsibility of the government elected next May. A yes victory will make those May elections far more interesting than any these countries have seen in living memory, making critical decisions about the structure of our society and letting us south of the border share the intoxication now gripping Scotland.\n\nMartin Juckes\n\nReading\n\n* Simon Jenkins again calls for a non-monetary vision of the future of the UK to inspire a no vote and loyalty from its constituent parts (A yes vote will produce a leaner, meaner Scotland, 5 September), and on the same day Jeffrey Henderson (Letters) calls for a governmental federal structure to be established. I should like to put the two together and say that a federal structure would call for a federal capital and that its creation could be the basis for a new vision.\n\nIn December 2011, the centenary of the announcement of moving the capital of British India from Calcutta to Delhi, the Architectural Review published an article of mine arguing that a similar move should be considered for this country.\n\nThe reasons were both economic and political: the urgent need to spread prosperity and the pressure for development away from the south-east, and the political need for a structure where the capital of the UK was not also the capital of England.\n\nA hundred years ago, wealth was fairly evenly distributed, with thriving industry in the north and west and commerce and government in the south-east. But with industry no longer thriving, everything - both government and commerce - is now concentrated in the south-east.\n\nCommerce we cannot move, but government we can. The government whose duty is to serve the whole country equally should be located in the place where it can best do so.\n\nJames Dunnett\n\nLondon\n\n* Mark Tran (Ministers try the Quebec ploy, 7 September) might have mentioned that the Parti Qu\u00e9becois supports \"sovereignty partnership\" with the rest of Canada, which, among other things, would mean that a sovereign Quebec would retain the Canadian dollar and the Canadian military. Nor should it be forgotten that the Cree people are demanding that Qu\u00e9bec reverts to its pre-1912 boundaries, whereby the Cree would achieve a form of confederated \"culture-land\" within the Canadian nation state.\n\nThe picture across Canada is complex, especially in Alberta and British Columbia in relation to the so-called Northern Gateway and the actual and potential destruction of the ecology and community lives of First Nation people and their neighbours. Canada today is far from being a country at ease with itself, and not just in Quebec.\n\nBruce Ross-Smith\n\nOxford\n\n* I think Jonathan Freedland misunderstands what is happening in Scotland (If Britain loses Scotland, it will feel like an amputation, 5 September). The case being made for Scottish \"separation\" (sic) is notable in part precisely because, by proposing a currency union along with various measures of \"social union\", it implicitly acknowledges that in today's world total independence is impossible. The argument is: vote yes for a fresh start, on the basis of which we can then (through discussion and negotiation) develop areas of cooperation where it's sensible; a new sort of union, then. The point about the fresh start is that it offers a way of jolting our sclerotic body politic off its deathbed. But a yes vote wouldn't end interdependence, nor destroy the geo-cultural entity that is Britain.\n\nRichard Middleton\n\nCastle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway",

But a shock YouGov poll at the weekend that put the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time, published by the Sunday Times, has meant everyone is waking up to the idea that the people of Scotland could very well choose to leave the UK on 18 September. The other regionalist parties of Great Britain are particularly keen observers.\n\n\"There is a growing recognition that the extremities [of the UK] are beginning to move away,\" Richard Carter, leader of the Yorkshire First party, tells the New Statesman. \"But independence is the wrong solution - an argument about borders doesn't make sense in our interconnected world.\"\n\nYorkshire First was only set up in March of this year, but two months later it won over 19,000 votes in the European elections in the Yorkshire and Humber region. Clearly it has managed to capture the anti-Westminster, localist mood that has become prevalent across swathes of the UK.\n\nThe far more established Plaid Cymru, which, in the long term, seeks full independence for Wales, are watching the referendum intently. Leanne Wood, leader of Plaid Cymru, is currently in Scotland helping out with the Yes campaign. She tells the New Statesman: \"What's incredibly interesting is that the Yes campaign is a truly grassroots movement. People are really informed - I've never seen this level of engagement before. Chatting to taxi drivers about polls in the FT is a common experience!\"\n\nWood is partly there to see what tactics she can take back to Wales. She highlights the cross-societal aspect of the Yes campaign as particularly effective: \"There's been a deliberate attempt to have people involved who aren't aligned with political parties. It's not just the same old characters.\"\n\nThe Scottish referendum is being greeted with similar interest by Dick Cole, leader of Mebyon Kernow, a centre-left party that campaigns for a National Assembly for Cornwall: \"What's happening in Scotland gives us hope, even though we're campaigning for devolution, not independence. For us, it's about getting some devolution to the Cornish people - at the moment where there is devolution, it's to LEPs [Local Enterprise Partnerships] and quangos, and that's not very democratic.\"\n\nCole has also recently been on a trip to Scotland: he was invited to speak on the implications of the referendum at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August. He likewise came back surprised by how involved so many Scots are. \"The impression I got was that there's such an engaged debate, and we're really jealous of that.\"\n\nMembership enquiries for the Wessex Regionalist Party are on the increase, according to general secretary David Robins. \"It's affecting us very positively. Scottish independence will cause a rethink of British politics - whichever way it goes, we feel we'll be able to benefit from it.\"\n\nThe Wessex Regionalist Party, formed in the Seventies, campaigns for powers to be devolved from Westminster to Wessex, an area it defines as the southwest of England, excluding Cornwall, but including Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. \"I don't think we'd ever want independence,\" Robins says. \"We value the English context.\"\n\nThe most dramatic sentiments come from Robin Tilbrook, chair of the English Democrats, a party that once campaigned for the establishment of an English Parliament and First Minister in imitation of the Scottish and Welsh models. It now fights for England to become an independent country - \"over time we've become jaundiced at the idea the UK could be reformable as a proper democratic country.\"\n\nTilbrook, a practising litigation solicitor, says that the dissolution of the Act of Union, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland in 1707, would mean not just that Scotland left the UK, but that the UK would no longer exist. \"As a lawyer it makes no sense to speak of the UK if Scotland leaves.\" The 1801 Acts of Union, which joined Ireland to Great Britain, would also become invalid: \"Great Britain was a term invented to include Scotland, legally and linguistically.\"\n\n\"The referendum debate certainly justifies much of what we've been saying,\" he says, happily. \"England will be almost independent as a consequence of this, although the union with Wales isn't dissolved.\"\n\nTilbrook has also been on the lookout for Yes campaign tactics that could be used by the English Democrats. \"A couple of their supporters gave \u00a35m to the Yes Campaign,\" he says, referring to Chris and Colin Weir, before continuing with a chuckle: \"If we had \u00a35m, that would do no end of good.\"",

Last year I charged the party to win 20 new seats in the new Scottish Parliament. Some said it couldn't be done. You did it; we are the government.\"\n\nAnd he added: \"Now I am charging the party to build a Scottish block of at least 20 MPs in the Westminster parliament, people ready, willing and able to defend our parliament and our people. If we can achieve that, then all the Westminster 'Noes' will suddenly becomes 'Yeses'. We can make Westminster dance to a Scottish jig.\"\n\nMr Salmond believes that there is likely to be a hung parliament following the next general election, with no party able to form an outright majority government.\n\nIn that scenario, an SNP block of 20 MPs - maybe even working with Plaid Cymru and possibly the Ulster Unionists to take the total to 30 or more - would have influence and would be able to extract policy commitments in return for keeping one of the bigger parties in power.\n\nA spokesman for the First Minister stressed afterwards that the SNP was not looking for formal coalitions, but would be willing to trade support for policy commitments on an \"issue by issue basis\". The SNP has just six MPs at Westminster at the moment. It would need a swing of at least 14 or 15 per cent to take another 14 seats in 2010, which is when experts expect the next election to be called.\n\nAngus Robertson, the SNP's chief election strategist, refused to name his target seats yesterday, but it is understood that Dundee West, Ochil and South Perthshire, Stirling, Argyll and Bute, and Edinburgh East are high on the SNP's most-wanted list.\n\nBut elections expert Professor John Curtice warned that Mr Salmond's 20-seat goal would be very hard to achieve.\n\nHe said: \"The most recent poll which gave the SNP its best Westminster figures, by Market Research UK, put the SNP and Labour on even-stevens.\n\n\"But to get 20 seats, the SNP would need to be ahead, and Labour and the Liberal Democrats would need to be plummeting at the same time. It's a tall order.\"\n\nMr Salmond was cheered repeatedly by delegates in the small but packed hall at Heriot Watt University yesterday for his annual spring conference speech.\n\nHe stressed the achievements he said the SNP had delivered in its first year of government, from cutting the cost of prescriptions to abolishing tolls on the Forth and Tay bridges.\n\nThe First Minister defended his party's controversial local income tax plans, claiming it would be much fairer for more low-income Scots than the combination of the council tax and the Treasury's decision to cut the 10p tax rate.\n\nHe also answered Gordon Brown's argument that it was wrong to push for independence in an increasingly interdependent world.\n\nMr Salmond said: \"The reality of the 21st century is that the processes of independence and interdependence are one and the same.\n\n\"As our world becomes ever more interconnected in terms of trade, international relations, the environment and security, the case for nations having a voice at global level becomes ever more compelling.\n\n\"It is by becoming independent that nations can maximise their influence in our interdependent world.\"\n\nIt was a bullish performance by a First Minister buoyed up by a year in government and ready to continue pounding opponents who have had trouble challenging the SNP in any meaningful way over the past 12 months.\n\nIt was a speech designed for the party activists, and the several hundred who came to Edinburgh clearly enjoyed it, giving Mr Salmond a tumultuous and sustained standing ovation after his 40-minute address.\n\nMr Salmond ended by warning the UK government not to bully the Scottish Government.\n\n\"The more that Westminster tries to lay down the law north of the Border in clearly devolved areas, to bully the Scottish Parliament, the greater the support there will be for independence and equality for Scotland,\" he said, to enthusiastic applause.\n\nThe SNP will seek to build on Mr Salmond's rhetoric by launching a major campaign offensive next month, even though there is not scheduled to be an election of any sort in Scotland before the 2009 European elections.\n\nThe Nationalists will send out nearly one million leaflets promoting the work of the Scottish Government and asking for feedback.\n\nThe aim is to build up the party's database ahead of the 2010 general election, allowing party strategists to target voters with as much precision and as much success as they did in the 2007 Scottish elections.\n\nPressure grows for commission to look at independence\n\nWENDY Alexander is facing increasingly strident demands from inside the Labour movement for independence to be considered by the flagship commission that is reviewing the devolution settlement.\n\nThe Scottish Labour leader has championed the Scottish Constitutional Commission, and has been adamant it will not consider the possible merits of independence.\n\nBut now Steven Purcell, the Labour leader of Glasgow City Council, has admitted that his council will table submissions to both the commission and the rival \"national conversation\" on independence, set up by the Scottish Government.\n\nIt also emerged yesterday that the Public and Commercial Services Union will call this week at the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Inverness for the commission's remit to be widened to include independence.\n\nThe union's motion is particularly embarrassing for Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, who will address the conference later today and who has given his backing to the commission but is firmly opposed to it discussing independence.\n\nMr Purcell, who was on Ms Alexander's leadership campaign team, said it was \"legitimate\" to consider independence as part of a review of devolution. \"Post-devolution Scotland will always have a debate about the parliament, about the future and, yes, it may possibly include independence,\" he said.\n\nA Scottish Labour spokeswoman said: \"The vast majority of Scots have constantly rejected independence, therefore the commission will focus on reviewing the settlement within a UK framework.\"",

It's fascinating to see all the people talk about politics, young people too,\" said Margaret David, a 62-year-old activist for the pro-independence \"Yes\" campaign.\n\n\"This is a time of change. Before nobody listened to the people -- now they feel they can make a difference and be listened for once.\"\n\nGarey Cooker, a 25-year-old member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), recounts listening to a group of teenagers on the bus discussing the question of European Union funding.\n\nAnd while his parents and older brother are opposed to independence -- just one of many families divided on the issue -- he believes the independence camp might just win.\n\nUntil last month, it looked to be heading for certain defeat, but two opinion polls in recent days put the two sides neck and neck.\n\n\"We were always behind. I always thought we could do it, but now it's like: oh my god we are going to do it!\" Cooker said, pushing an umpteenth leaflet through a letter box.\n\n\"At some point it just clicks in and snowballs. It takes time to adjust to the idea of change.\"\n\nWhile the \"No\" camp has been appealing to the \"silent majority\" they say want Scotland to stay in the UK, activists for independence are a vocal bunch.\n\n\"We fight for something. They fight against something. Makes it easier for us,\" Cooker said.\n\nLike many in the SNP, he is driven by the success of the 2011 Scottish election campaign which saw a final push propel First Minister Alex Salmond into power.\n\nHoping to repeat that operation, hundreds of activists are out campaigning in Edinburgh, armed with SNP publications and a precious list of undecided voters.\n\n\"I feel that more and more people are leaning to the 'Yes' side,\" observed Terence Chang, a 50-year-old photographer.\n\nBorn in Hong Kong, raised in Australia and a \"proud\" resident of Scotland for the past 24 years, he has a shop selling knick-knacks celebrating the independence campaign.\n\nTwo fluffy toy pandas sit in the window, a reminder, Chang says, that Edinburgh has more of the rare animals in its zoo (two) than Cameron has members of parliament in Scotland.\n\nOut of 59 representatives of Scotland in the House of Commons in London, just one is a Conservative.\n\nCameron headed to Edinburgh on Wednesday in a united push for the UK with his deputy in the government coalition, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, and British opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband.\n\nBut the \"Yes\" campaigners in Edinburgh are not worried.\n\n\"It's so typical Westminster. They think if they show up it will be alright,\" said Cooker.\n\n\"None of them is really liked here,\" adds David.\n\n\"They have never done nothing for us apart from stealing our resources, taking away everything and leaving only crumbs on the table.\n\n\"Now they try to scare us but I'm not afraid at all. I don't believe they will give us more powers. Only promises, lies. They are going to punish us for pushing our heads up.\"",

                    "body": "Rupert Murdoch's intrusion into the Scottish referendum debate shows that the old media tycoon remains emotionally wedded to populism.\n\nIt is in his nature to dislike those elites of which he is not a member and he perceives in Alex Salmond an anti-establishment figure who could well upset the United Kingdom apple cart.\n\nMurdoch, grandson of a Scot, has posted seven tweets to date that rejoice in the movement of opinion polls in favour of the SNP leader's independence campaign.\n\nBut they also reflect his deep dislike for the current party leaders in Westminster. One said: \"Scottish independence means huge black eye for whole political establishment, especially Cameron and Miliband.\"\n\nIn another, referring to the Tories and Labour as \"southern parties\", he suggested their promise of greater autonomy for Scotland in return for a No vote lacked credibility and was \"too late.\"\n\nBut his latest pair of tweets are equivocal: \"Wrestling with Scottish vote,\" said one, while the other said: \"Scots better people than to be dependants [sic] of London. Hard choice with real pain for some time. Maybe too much.\"\n\nIt is no wonder that all eyes (in England, if not Scotland) are on the Scottish Sun to see whether it dares to embrace independence by urging its 246,000 buyers to vote Yes on 18 September.\n\nGordon Smart, the paper's Glasgow-based editor, is not letting on. Nor is the London-based editor, and fellow Scot, David Dinsmore.\n\nThere have been some pointers in recent issues of the Sun's Scottish editions. An editorial yesterday scorned the \"belated intervention\" of former Labour leader Gordon Brown, with a side-swipe at prime minister David Cameron.\n\nThe previous day's editorial treated the Better Together campaign to a dose of sarcasm, with an adjacent article by its political editor Andrew Nicoll damning the plan to offer new powers to a devolved Scottish parliament.\n\nLast Thursday, the paper ran a spread in which its popular columnist Bill Leckie wrote of his dramatic u-turn in deciding to vote Yes.\n\nToday's Sun, with a front page poking fun at the problems of the men raising the saltire over Downing Street, continues the negative tone about David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg.\n\nIts editorial argues that the English party leaders' concessions to the Scots have come too late because they were not listening years ago to \"voices outside the Westminster bubble.\" It continues:\n\n\"Had they done so, they wouldn't now be watching Alex Salmond confidently leading Scotland towards his vision of a promised land... it is now clear that Scots in growing numbers are willing too take the risk - and without fear.\"\n\nClearly, it will now be only a small step by the Scottish Sun, the largest-selling paper north of the border, to back independence. Even so, Murdoch's mischief-making may not be decisive.\n\nThere are plenty of Scots papers, not to mention the other Scots editions of papers based in London, that together out-sell the Sun. Their combined sales represent a much greater proportion of the Scottish population.\n\nThe Daily Record (sales: 204,000) has been attempting a difficult trick by remaining supportive of the Labour party - and, in broad terms, of the union - while acknowledging what its leading article yesterday called \"Scotland's genuine disillusionment with Westminster.\"\n\nIt therefore supported Gordon Brown's 12-point autonomy plan, arguing that it was \"notable\" for its \"level of detail\". It concluded: \"Suddenly the fight to save the union takes on a whole new dimension.\"\n\nThe Scottish Daily Mail (sales: 93,000) has been staunchly pro-union. It splashed on David Cameron's impassioned plea today and carried seven more full pages, most of which attacked Salmond.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Mail lavished praise on Brown's initiative, urging the people to celebrate \"from the rooftops the glorious treasure we share in our British identity.\"\n\nThe Scottish Daily Express (48,000) and its stablemate, the Daily Star of Scotland (41,000), have also adopted a similar unionist stance. They carried similar leaders on Tuesday, demanding that \"our country\" be saved \"from narrow, destructive and divisive nationalism\".\n\nThere is little surprise in these unionist views adopted by the kilted editions of English papers. But the referendum debate has proved much more problematic for the country's home-grown newspapers. Which side, if at all, should they support?\n\nMost have refused to nail their colours (or the saltire) to the mast in the belief that they might unduly upset readers who disagree with their choice.\n\nWith the the pre-referendum polls having switched from a majority in favour of voting No to the current neck-and-neck, that may have been a wise commercial decision.\n\nFour titles, the The Herald in Glasgow (38,000), The Scotsman in Edinburgh (27,000), the Dundee Courier (49,000) and Aberdeen Press & Journal (62,000), have been attempting to pursue a largely neutral course.\n\nMy conversations with their editors suggest their impartial stance has been less about the likely effect on circulation than a reasoned journalistic need to reflect the political debate as fairly as possible.\n\nPress & Journal editor Damian Bates told me: \"We are simply providing as much info as possible and encouraging readers to make sure they don't miss the opportunity to make their voice heard. This isn't a corporate view; it's purely driven by the editorial integrity of the newspaper.\"\n\nThe Scotsman's choice of opinion articles, plus the size and placement of news stories favouring the No position, suggest that it is in the unionist camp. The Herald's choices have been more impartial.\n\nDespite that neutrality, Herald editor Magnus Llewellin says his paper has been attacked by both sides because people perceive bias even in straightforward news stories.\n\nHe has not followed his stablemate's decision to declare for independence. In early May, the Sunday Herald ran a front page stating its support for Yes voters. And, to date, it is the only title to have done so.\n\nThe result has been a remarkable circulation boost. Unlike every other paper, where sales have been slipping away in line with the overall UK market decline, the Sunday Herald has put on sales.\n\nIn April, it sold an average of 24,066 copies an issue. In June, it sold 29,667 - an eye-popping 23% increase. Unaudited figures show further rises since.\n\nEditor Richard Walker stresses that he did not adopt the independence position for sales reasons. \"It could have gone either way,\" he said. \"I made the decision because I thought it was right for the people of Scotland to get them a voice.\"\n\nBefore his declaration for a Yes vote, he called staff together to discuss it. He didn't call for a show of hands but had the backing of the majority of the senior journalists, plus his management. The paper is part of the Newsquest chain, which is owned ultimately by the US newspaper company, Gannett.\n\nIn company with other observers, Walker believes - in spite of occasional outbreaks of bad behaviour - that the debate has been \"positive and beneficial\" for Scottish people by engaging them in politics as never before.\n\nA former Scottish editor with a teenage daughter agreed. \"Young people are talking about politics in the pubs and restaurants rather than fashion, music, football,\" he said. \"It's a great debate.\"\n\nBut the undeniable truth is that these young people are not reading newspapers. It is assumed by most editors that their ageing readerships are more likely to be pro-union voters and that has surely influenced their editorial agendas.\n\nEven Walker, the editor who said Yes, has been taken by surprise by the movement of the polls. He said: \"With an expected turn-out of 80% or more, and with hundreds of thousands of first-time voters, it's just too close to call.\"",

                    "body": "Strong feelings: Labour MP Jim Murphy, who is touring Scotland in support of the Union, gets stuck into debate with advocates of independence in Dundee city centre. Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe British Act of Union dates to 1707 and the colonisation of Australia by Britain to 1788 (followed by the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901). In the former case Scotland became part of the United Kingdom and in the latter Australia's new constitution was created under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.\n\nNow Scotland is holding a referendum on September 18 asking whether the Act of Union should continue or whether Scotland should become an independent nation. The exact question is \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" Some No advocates argue that the \"outside world has a stake in the outcome\" for global security reasons and should therefore get involved, but wiser heads than our own Prime Minister conclude that the Scots should decide for themselves.\n\nThis referendum has been a long time coming. A regional Scottish Parliament was created by the British government in 1998 deliberately to assuage demands for greater Scottish autonomy. The pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) has an even longer history. In 2011 the SNP won office, under First Minister Alex Salmond, promising to hold a referendum.\n\nThe relationship between Scotland and Australia would be barely changed by a successful referendum as Scotland would remain part of the Commonwealth owing allegiance to the British Crown. A Yes vote would not make Scotland a republic. But Scottish nationalism is part of Australian debate for three types of reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first is that Scots heritage is a major part of Australian culture and society. The Scottish Australian Heritage Council had Michael Bryce, husband of the previous Governor-General , as its patron until recently. Scots-Australians and transient Scots living in Australia are being asked their opinion to give local colour to Australian stories.\n\nSecondly Tony Abbott intervened clumsily but predictably in the debate by stating that those driving the Yes campaign, including Salmond, were not the friends of justice nor of freedom.\n\nThirdly, there has been discussion of the possible impact of the referendum on Australia. There have been some, including the late Harry Evans, who started a debate in the Canberra Times last February to draw attention to what he saw as the possible direct effects on Australia. Evans was always a very independent thinker. It was one of his last campaigns and he wrote to me shortly afterwards seeking to enlist the support of some people in the republican movement. He told me then that \"The gist of my argument is that as the Constitution confers executive powers, etc on the heirs and successors of Queen Victoria , if the UK is broken up by the Scots leaving there will be no such person and we will be in an unconstitutional position\".\"\n\nHe was taken to task by several respondents, who tried to rebut his argument. I replied that apart from keeping monarchy-republican issues in the limelight I couldn't see any great strength in his argument. However, there are interesting parallels between the two nationalist campaigns that deserve exploration.\n\nThe direct parallels, of course, are to the past secessionist campaigns in Australia, especially by Western Australia in the 1930s, and to the response by the Commonwealth of Australia. Equalisation measures in the Australian federation, such as the Commonwealth Grants Commission, were a direct attempt to meet Western Australian complaints about Eastern dominance.\n\nNew state campaigns, especially in the New England area of New South Wales in the 1960s, were another attempt to refashion our constitutional arrangements for regional economic and cultural identity reasons.\n\nThen there was the 1999 republican referendum, which took a different tack, trying to assert not regional but Australian national identity within the bigger imperial and Commonwealth framework.\n\nThese three types of Australian constitutional reform have all failed so far. This indicates the enormous power of the status quo, even when it is a relatively recent status quo (less than a century when these efforts were made).\n\nIt also shows the difficulty of reform because of the negative power of the unknown and lingering fears of an uncertain future. Such factors have dogged the efforts of francophone Quebecois secessionists to break away from Canada. These factors also certainly apply to the Scottish referendum though polls show the two sides running neck and neck at the moment. The No case focuses on possible financial and economic insecurity and some Scots-Australian business leaders back this interpretation. It is only a small step to versions of the Australian monarchist slogan: \"If you don't know, vote No\".\n\nNational pride and the desire for increased autonomy are powerful factors too, however. The Scottish No case recognises this and has used an important bargaining chip in trying to buy off reformist voters. Both the British Conservative-SDP government and the Labour Opposition have promised even further devolution of powers to Scotland, including tax and welfare powers, if the referendum is lost. So even if they lose the referendum disappointed Scottish nationalists will have made further progress.\n\nThis conciliatory approach, even if adopted for base strategic purposes, is not to be found in the Australian republic debate, where the monarchist Prime Minister is even winding back what he sees as republican-type changes. The prime example is his reintroduction of knighthoods and damehoods for high office-holders in Australia.\n\nUnfortunately Harry Evans did not live to see the outcome of the Scottish referendum. It is another case of the difficulty of constitutional reform and a Yes vote would be a quite remarkable departure from the status quo. AlthoughI don't expect any direct impact on the Australian republican debate, indirectly there are enough interesting parallels for all Australians to keep a close eye on what happens.\n\nJohn Warhurst is an emeritus professor of political science at the Australian National University and deputy convener of the Australian Republican Movement (ACT)\n\nJohn.Warhurst@anu.edu.au",

The impact of that on everyone in the United Kingdom, not just Scotland, would be absolutely profound,\" he told Radio Four's Today programme.\n\n\"And from observing the debate that has gone I am not at all convinced that people have fully understood what all the implications of this are and those implications are what matters this morning.\"\n\nMr Salmond has suggested that if there is no currency union a separate Scotland would continue using the pound unilaterally in the same manner as countries like Panama have adopted the US dollar.\n\nBut he has admitted this is only a transition option without stating what currency would follow.\n\nSir John said: \"What currency are they going to use? It's one week away from the vote and the people of Scotland do not know what currency they would have. I've never known such incompetence.\"\n\nOn oil, he said that oil production will diminish then run out and \"it will affect young people who are voting in this election. They should consider that.\"\n\nAddressing the sudden swing in the polls, he said: \"Suddenly Scots who work next to us live next to us are our friends, our neighbours, our work mates suddenly become foreigners. Is that no an extraordinary proposition for a nation that had marched together.\n\n\"This year is the 100th anniversary of the first world war as we honour those who fought together then would it not be extraordinary if the SNP broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world.\"\n\nSir John warned the break-up of the country, combined with the potential loss of Trident, would leave it diminished on the world stage.\n\nHe added that the Queen was right not to enter the debate, despite calls from some MPs for her to do so and Alex Salmond's claim she would be proud to be monarch of a separate Scotland.\n\nMeanwhile, Alistair Darling told BBC Radio Scotland that the Unionist parties' plans to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament would be quicker and far less risky than separation.",

It prompted me to wonder if Alex Salmond hadn't woken up in a sweat from a dream in which the yes campaign had won and begged them to save him from the consequences.\n\nAll right, it's a joke and Salmond has duly denied scare stories. But, like all serious jokes, it conveys an underlying truth, namely that the first minister's sights were once set on what we now call Devo-Max - greater devolved powers for Edinburgh, rather than the SNP's formal goal of full independence from the rest of the UK (rUK).\n\nAll sorts of people, including the Guardian's intrepid Scotland correspondent, Severin Carrell, get a raspberry whenever they point this out. The veteran Scottish commentator, Magnus Linklater, did so again in the Times this week when he wrote that a yes win would be the result \"neither side wants ... a crisis that both Cameron and Salmond would like to avoid\" - not least because Salmond the economist knows the myriad risks an independent Scotland would face.\n\nLinklater's argument reflects what I was told by a prominent public official and acknowledged expert on the detailed background to the drama - a pro-devolution, anti-independence Scot, incidentally. The way he tells it is: \"Alex Salmond did not want to have this referendum in the first place. The promise was in his 2011 manifesto for the Holyrood elections, which he did not expect to win. He was saddled with it.\"\n\nSalmond had been running a minority SNP regime at Holyrood since 2007 after the post-Iraq, post-Blair puncturing of UK Labour and the lacklustre record of its Scottish leadership. The Scottish Labour party is a gloomy, fratricidal set-up (\"the least comradely I have experienced around the world\", says a Scottish leftie friend), but Scots Blair and Brown largely left it to its own devices while they governed Britain.\n\nThe once-dominant Scottish Tories (they won half Scotland's seats in 1955) had imploded as a result of Brand Thatcher - though they still polled 412,000 votes to the SNP's 491,000 in 2010, they got only one seat. But as a result of David Cameron's failure to win a Commons majority in 2010, he was forced to entice the Lib Dems into a coalition at Westminster.\n\nScotland had its chance to register disapproval the following May. Salmond's team hadn't bust the bank in government, it had even done popular things like bribing the middle class on student fees, NHS scrips and end-of-life care (all free!), and gained ground. What made the difference between a modest win and the SNP's 69-seats-out-of-129 majority was the collapse of the Lib Dem and minor parties - mostly on the left - in the second \"top-up seat\" vote. Labour lost seven seats, the Tories five, but the Lib Dems 12. Here are the details.\n\nSo if Scotland breaks the Union the Nats should build a statue of Nick Clegg next to William Wallace's monument at Stirling, next to Salmond's as well.\n\nBut what of Devo-Max? It had been talked about, but not included in the SNP's 2011 manifesto. The UK government's consent to the referendum was needed and given, but Cameron sensed that a let-out soft option which allowed the Nats to come back for more would be a concession too far. He insisted that Salmond stage the yes/no referendum promised in his manifesto - not a three-option choice. What may have looked smart in 2012 may not look smart next Friday morning.\n\nOf course, if yes wins next week, then Cameron may be putsched by his own party, and may in any case pay the price for his miscalculation and complacency at rUK's general election on 7 May.\n\nProf Alan Trench, the tireless constitutional analyst, has even suggested it may suit rUK to speed up Scottish independence to 7 May 2015 - a year before Salmond's high-speed date. That strikes me as wishful thinking.\n\nTrench has gently outlined the post-yes negotiating problems, mildly observing that rUK does not want an unstable failed state on its northern border and holds most of the negotiating cards. The polite word he uses is \"asymmetrical\".\n\nSo whatever the SNP finance minister, John Swinney, said again on Thursday about having a mandate to negotiate a currency union if Scots vote to leave the one they have, Cameron doesn't have one. Why should rUK shoulder the downside risks Scotland has voted to create?\n\nBefore catching my train at Edinburgh Waverley last week, I spent an enjoyable hour in the nearby Scottish National Gallery. My pleasure was dampened by the recurring thought: \"I wouldn't like to be the person who has to sort out the ownership of this lot.\"",

                    "body": "The Scots will vote next Thursday on whether they will seek independence from England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. New polls showing a recent shift in public opinion has suddenly made independence much more plausible.\n\nAnd if Scotland does vote for independence, it could be the start of a domino effect for similar situations throughout Europe, analysts say.\n\nOther areas have been seeking to hold independence referendums -- Spain, for example, is worried that Scotland's situation could embolden separatists in the Catalonia region, though a tentatively scheduled referendum set for Nov. 9 in Catalonia has been ruled unconstitutional by Spanish courts.\n\nGeopolitical expert Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, said Monday he doesn't expect Scots to end up voting for independence. But if they pull off a shocker, there could be many reverberating effects from the vote -- one being that other separatist-fueled areas will be encouraged.\n\n\"If it does happen, this European 'contagion' risk that you mention is very real,\" Bremmer, told Business Insider on Monday.\n\n\"Other countries will look very closely at how European institutions and member states would manage it. In Spain, Prime Minister Rajoy and the Constitutional Court have both ruled out a similar referendum for Catalonia. But a 'yes' in Scotland would make for a much noisier situation in Spain. After a 'yes' vote, Scotland would effectively become the pioneer, carving a path forward that Catalonia would try and follow.\"\n\nIn addition to Catalonia, the Basque region of Spain also is home to a budding legion of separatists who want to vote for independence. Other, less mature independence movements that could grow include the Dutch-speaking Flanders region of Belgium, as well as Venice and other areas in northern Italy.\n\nA \"yes\" vote in Scotland would likely lead to a tenuous, uncertain situation as it tries to regain membership into the European Union by the time it would become fully independent in March 2016. To get back into the EU would require a unanimous vote by current members, which may be impossible as countries like Spain and Belgium would want to use the situation as a deterrent to separatist movements in their own countries.\n\n\"That would be incredibly messy, precisely because countries like Spain and Belgium would have an incentive to bar Scottish membership given their own situations,\" Bremmer said.\n\n\"We saw the same thing when Greece was on the ropes a few years ago: if Athens had moved for the Eurozone exit, members had strong incentives to make that a scorched path, an economically violent process that would keep others from following in Greece's footsteps. Some EU members would surely make an example out of Scotland.\"\n\nScottish independence would also lead to a host of other questions: Would it be able to still use the British pound, which fell to its lowest level in 10 months on news of the polls? Would it be able to stay a member of NATO?\n\nAll of those questions would have to be sorted out. But the biggest effect of Scottish independence, Bremmer said, could be the ultimate change of Britain's political landscape. Currently, 40 of Scotland's 59 members parliament come from the Labour party compared to just one from the conservative-leaning Tories.\n\nAs Bremmer explained, Scottish independence would \"tilt the entire U.K. political spectrum to the right.\" That would boost the odds of a conservative majority winning in 2015.\n\nUltimately, he said, it could be a \"game-changer\" for the chances of a referendum on an \"in-or-out\" referendum on the U.K.'s place in the E.U. Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed a referendum in 2017 if the conservative party wins an outright majority next year.\n\n\"If Scotland votes 'yes,' down the road would come the ultimate irony,\" Bremmer said. \"The U.K. would be more likely to pull out of the E.U., while Scotland clamors to get in.\"",

                    "body": "Labour member for Rutherglen put's forward the case for saying \"No Thanks\"\n\n* Please note, interview took place on Friday, September 5\n\nThe last couple of days have settled down for Better Together after a poor week.\n\nJK: We've been really pleased with the response we've been getting this week. I think this has been a really exciting campaign. What I've really enjoyed about it is getting out and speaking to so many people in Cambuslang and Rutherglen and what I find is people are really keen to engage on the issues. In terms of this week we've been picking up a lot of support for no. People continue to be concerned about what currency is going to be used.\n\nWhat are the issues coming up on the doorstep?\n\nJK: The issues from our perspective is the currency remains a major issue because people want to know what the currency will be in an independent Scotland and they recognise that could potentially impact on their mortgages, their cost of living and would hit people in the pockets, people are worried about the impact of jobs, clearly there's a big investment in financial services and shipyard jobs, on the Clyde here, worry those jobs won't be sustained in an independent Scotland.\n\nJim McColl tells us he's going to quadruple the number of jobs at Ferguson's.\n\nJK: I think the reality is, if we decide we're an independent country and therefore an foreign country to the rest of the UK, there will be a question asked will the rest of the UK place defence contracts in a foreign country and I think people are very alive to that. I also think people are concerned about pensions. Currently part of a country that has 63million people paying into the pension pot, we're protected under the UK pensions protections scheme which protected 24,000 people's pensions when they went bust in effect, we would lose that protection. People are looking for a positive reason to vote No and I firmly believe that we would be able to build more houses, build a stronger NHS, support our local education system, and have a better economy creating jobs after a No vote.\n\nSpeaking about pensions, in this week's Reformer, Bob Doris MSP says the DWP say independence would have no effect on pensions, is that not the case?\n\nJK: Two things, there's an issue about cross border pension schemes which then if you go independent would need to be fully funded, so there would be a real question mark over UK wide pensions schemes. And in terms of the state pension, you're going from a pot that 63million people pay into to one that 5million people pay into and therefore, I think there's a real question as to the protection of that going forward, so I would question Mr Doris on that.\n\nThere are areas in Rutherglen and Cambuslang like Halfway and Whitlawburn that suffer from extreme deprivation, surely the Union isn't working for them?\n\nJK: What's needed, if you look at areas like Halfway and Whitlawburn, they have been hit hard by the welfare reform programme of that's been pursued by the Tory Government and what I firmly want to see is a No vote in this ref and in eight months time the election of a Labour Government that will tackle some of the issues that we see in halfway and Whit., For example, Labour are proposing an energy price freeze, whereas in an independent Scotland energy prices would go up \u00a3875 a year. Labour are proposing a cap on bankers bonuses and are looking to enhance minimum wage levels. I think that different approach will help contribute to turning round those communities. I come from Halfway, I know the issues, and I know some of a deep seated problems, no-one is going to wave a magic wand for it to change overnight But I'll make this point, if you have \u00a36bn less in a country's budget in an independent Scotland the situation will be much graver in Halfway and Whitlawburn than it would be if we could get a stronger Scottish Parliament and the election of a Labour Government next year committed to social justice.\n\nOne area where Yes are strong is the issue of democratic deficit. Every person in Scotland could vote Labour next year yet we could end up with a Conservative Government. How can our voice be heard in the UK?\n\nJK: The polls currently show that Labour are on course to win the General Election next year, the Tory leader, Ruth Davidson acknowledged the other night the Tories were unlikely to win. I reiterate the return of a Labour Government would introduce polices and values that are more in tune with what we are looking for in Scotland. I also think it's about having a stronger Scot Parliament and what's on thew table, additional borrowing powers coming in, \u00a32bn, although I'm speaking for the No campaign, if you take one of Labour's examples, speaking as a Labour politician, we would look to devolve housing benefit which is \u00a31.7bn and currently \u00a3432m of that is paid to private landlords and I think we've got to look at using more of that housing benefit money to build more houses in Cambuslang and Rutherglen. I know the Rutherglen/Cambuslanghousing association have an 11 year waiting list, these are some of the issues that have got to be tackled and they will not be tackled in an independent Scotland with a \u00a36bn black hole. We've got the best of both worlds, we need protection from the rest of the UK, we need more powers for the Scottish Parliament. That will allow the voice in Scotland to be heard and the issues to be addressed.\n\nPeople are asking what extra powers, you've given an example, but people don't trust Westminster to deliver that, they feel Westmninster hasn't worked for them. How do we know these extra powers are already coming?\n\nJK: Ed Milliband made absolutely clear it would be in the Labour manifesto and one of the first things Labour would do in power. If you go back to September 1997, prior to that when Labour were bringing forward a referendum to deliver a Scottish Parliament that was done within months in 1997, Alex Salmond said the Labour Party couldn't deliver a pizza, well the Labour Party delivered a parliament within months and the same energy and same commitment is here now for extra powers in 2015. We have actually got more powers coming which includes \u00a32bn extra borrowing powers, compare that to the \u00a36bn less that would result in what the SNP are proposing in terms of independent. Don't forget as well that one of the first things the SNP want to do is cut corporation tax. What that means is it takes half a billion pound out of the budget. What that means for local people in Rutherglen/Cambuslang, it means we've got less money to build houses, we've got less money to support our NHS and less money to support our local schools. So independence is a real threat to local people and local services and we need the protection of the UK and stronger Scottish Parliament and that's what a no vote gives us.\n\nLabour are offering extra powers, but what happens if the polls are not accurate? What happens if it's another Conservative Government that we can't do anything about?\n\nJK: In the polls Labour are currently ahead, and the reason I am confident people will support Ed Miliband and Labour is because the ideas Ed Miliband is putting across will make a real difference to working families. The Tories don't have the answers and the problems that people encounter in Cambuslang/Rutherglen are similar to the problems people encounter in Liverpool and Manchester, where people are on zero hour contracts, where people struggle to make ends meet because of rocketing power bills and Labour are going to directly address those issues. We'll be clamping down on zero hour contracts, we'll be looking at paying more in the Living Wage and looking to put a freeze on energy prices, I have confidence that the ideas and passion Ed Miliband showed yesterday (Thursday) in Blantyre will come out strongly in the election campaign and Labour will be successful.\n\nThere's one guaranteed way to make sure Conservatives aren't in power, and that's the vote for independence.\n\nJK: I look at these issues across the United Kingdom. We've all got friends and relatives who live and work, based in England and Wales. I think the problems people in Cambuslang/Rutherglen face are similar to those that people face in Liverpool and Newcastle. And I am not prepared to cut off our family members and brothers and sisters in other parts of England to perpetual years of Tory Government, I want to see everyone across the United Kingdom benefiting from a positive Labour agenda that will make a difference. I'm not going to be like the SNP and simply look at Scotland and forget about the rest of the UK. I want to help people across these islands that have served us so well for 300 years that the union has been in place.\n\nWhat can be done to regain the confidence of the Westminster system? It's been eroded over the past few years.\n\nJK: One of things that has happened over the course of this campaign is people have become more engaged with politics. They understand the importance of politics and they understand that politics makes a difference so people are more engaged and I think the opportunity is there for the public to be more involved in politics, but also an opportunity for politicians like myself and those at Westminster to speak and engage with more people, not just across Rutherglen and Cambuslang but across the country. The way you improve the political system both in Scotland and Westminster is by speaking to communities. As I said earlier one of the great things I've enjoyed over past few months is getting out across the constituency every night talking to people on the doors about their issues and concerns and I think if people do that more and they see their politicians more out and about it strengthen their trust ion the system and makes for better political representation because people are more in tune with what people's concerns are\n\nWe've had the Scottish Parliament for 15 years, it was thought it would secure Scotland's place in the Union, yet here we are 15 years down the line with a referendum on independence. Has devolution worked?\n\nJK: I think devolution has worked because if you look over the period of time we've had landmark legislation passed like the smoking ban. Certainly in the early years, the first 10 years we had vast increases in the amount of public spending on schools and hospitals. Just look at the local schools in South Lanarkshire, part of that is funding from the Scottish Parliament, excellent leadership from local council which wouldn't have happened if we didn't have that. The Parliament has made a difference. One of the things I notice when people come through, local groups, and they're much closer to where the decisions are taken, they see the debates in action and people are better able to engage, so I think devolution has worked. What I would say is there's been a problem in the last few years that we've focused so much on this constitutional debate that we've not addressed the real issues. I know there are massive housing issues in Cambuslang and Rutherglen and I've continually argued we need to address that and I don't think the SNP Government have looked at that. I know there are thousands of people not being paid the Living Wage and these issues are not being addressed. I know that local councils like South Lanarkshire are facing swinging cuts which means some of the services are being minimised. I acknowledge this is a big debate that the country has to have, but one of the down sides of the last couple of years is the Government have taken their eye of the ball and not addressed the issues important to local people.\n\nHas the debate gone on too long?\n\nJK: What people don't like is uncertainty, businesses don't like uncertainty and people out in the local area don't like uncertainty and it would have been better if we'd reached a conclusion some time ago and that would have allowed up to move on and that would have let us deal with the concerns people have, but we need to accept the reality. It's been a two year campaign which we are now coming towards the final days off, it has seen a lot of people engaged in the campaign, people feel very strongly about it on either side and I'm looking forward to the final days, we're picking up a lot of strong support on the doorstep and I'm confident of a No victory on September 18\n\nIs the greatest danger to Scotland's place in the EU is a potential in/out referendum?\n\nJK: The biggest threat to EU membership is the fact that if we vote to go independent we're then outwith EU membership. Sure, there is a process to go through to renegotiate membership and try and get back in again, but it's unclear as to how long that would take and it's not guaranteed because some of the countries might vote against it. There's not an automatic transfer, you lose the Scottish part of the \u00a32bn rebate we get. Concerns I have is we would be losing more money from the EU, certainly in the short term, and there's the uncertainty, certainly for businesses and that ultimately that doesn't help local people because it leads to a downturn in the economy and that means there's less money circulating in Cambuslang/Rutherglen and there's a potential that jobs could be lost and people would have less money in their pocket.\n\nScotland's block grant is getting cut, is it understandable people are worried of the consequences?\n\nJK: People should be worried about the consequences of independence. If you look at what independent financial experts tell you, we would have \u00a36bn less on day one of an independent Scotland. In addition to that we spend more than we take in taxes. For example, in the last year alone we spent \u00a312bn more than we took in, so there would be a massive black hole in Scotland's finances. Aline that to the fact the SNP Government would rather give tax cuts to big businesses as opposed to supporting local people in Cambuslang and Rutherglen so you'd have a massive hole and what that would do is actually make the situation worse than it is.\n\nDon't we get less back than we put in?\n\nJK: I would completely reject that. If you look at the Government expenditure and revenue statistics for the last year, we would spend \u00a312bn more than we take in. We've run at a deficit in 20 of the last 21 years. The reality is, if we're an independent Scotland we'd have less money in our budget and what does that mean for people in Rutherglen/Cambuslang, it means they have less money in their pocket and less money to spend on much needed houses, less money to spend to support schools and less money to support the NHS.\n\nThe NHS has become a key battleground. There have been stories about Wales having to make cuts due to cuts in the block grant, what's to stop that happening in Scotland due to creeping privatisation down south?\n\nJK: The threats to the infrastructure of the NHS have been one of the big lies from Alex Salmond and the SNP in this campaign. First of all, health is fully devolved, that means all the decisions about health policy are taken in Scotland, by Scotland, so we control that policy. In terms of the budget, we also have control of the overall \u00a330bn Scottish budget, and sure we need to decide how much of that we spend on health, how much we spend on education, but those are decision we take. The final point, we currently have the SNP spending more than \u00a3100m on private health care in the NHS just now, that's up 23 per cent in the past year, so I don't think we'll have any lectures from the SNP about the threat of privatisation in the NHS. Sheer hypocrisy.\n\nBetter Together seem to treat oil as a burden, surely having it is a good thing?\n\nJK: For sure, it's an asset, I fully acknowledge that but the picture the Yes campaign want to paint is because we've got oil that will somehow make up for the shortfall you see in the budget. The reality is that's not the case. Sir Ian Wood who is an acknowledged expert in the oil field said the SNP were overestimating the oil production by 40 per cent. What that means, it all comes down to money, all comes down to finance. If the SNP plans are that they'll get \u00a37bn a year for oil, but that's been overestimated by 40 per cent, that's \u00a33bn a year less. In the last year alone there was a reduction in oil revenues of \u00a34.4bn, that's more than the schools budget. Oil is an asset, but I think it's wrong to try and claim it will suddenly fill the black hole that will exist under independence.\n\nOne of the big arguments has been over the sharing of assets and currency. Scotland has paid into the Bank of England over the years, should we not be entitled to a share? Would realpolitik take over, could we say get a currency union and keep Trident?\n\nJK: Why would a Government from England and Wales go into a currency union with a foreign country? I don't see anyone proposing going into a currency union with France, for example.\n\nIn order to keep Trident here, it might be prudent to offer something back......\n\nJK: The reality is, England, Wales and Northern Ireland would need to look at what's best for their economy and their conclusion is a currency union with a foreign country like Scotland would not be good for their economy. Therefore, the situation is that Scotland will be outwith that currency union. What does it mean for people in Cambuslang/Rutherglen? The technical thing that will happen, first and foremost, because you are outwith the pound, is interest rates will rise - this has been acknowledged by some SNP people - in the region 1.5 per cent. Any debt you are servicing costs more and that means less money in your budget and that impacts on local people because there's less money to be spent on schools and hospital in Cambuslang/Rutherglen and that affects jobs, it affects wages and that affects local people. That's why currency is important.\n\nWe hear that trade would be affected if we didn't share a currency, but surely the UK continues to trade with the Eurozone and beyond? Why not Scotland?\n\nJK: You've already had acknowledgement from companies like Standard Life, they will move jobs and services south of the border. So you have companies that are currently doing a lot of trading in Scotland and outwith Scotland, but again if you move jobs, you've less jobs in your country, you have less jobs in your economy, you have less people paying taxes, it all has a knock on affect on budgets and ends up affecting local people because there's less money. There's a real threat because of the way companies will move and that will affect trade.\n\nSurely \"it's our pound too?\"\n\nJK: It is currently because we're part of the UK but if you then say 'I don't want to be part of the UK' how can it be 'our pound'? We need to get away from some of the myth, the spins and the assertions from the SNP. You can't say you want to break away from a country and then say 'wait a minute, we want to use your currency, and we want to use your bank as a lender of last resort'. In effect you're saying to England, Wales and Northern Ireland 'we don't want to be part of that system,' so you can't have it all ways. You can't say you want to break away and then say you want to keep this part. It would not be in the interests of E, Wales and Northern Ireland to sustain that currency union and the reality is that would then fall apart.\n\nAre we not entitled to a share of the assets? When things have settled down, surely we would be entitled to a share of that asset?\n\nJK: One of the threats to the SNP is to walk away, irresponsibly, from our share of the debt. Ultimately, it's the Bank of England that controls the pound, it's the Bank of England that controls the currency, the Bank of England that's got a big say over fiscal policy. If we vote to go independent, we don't have any formal ties with the Bank of England so you immediately weaken any negotiation leverage you would have got, so I don't see that happening.\n\nAccording to the Yes campaign, Scotland on it's own would be the 14th richest country in the world based on GDP. Is the UK holding us back?\n\nJK: I don't accept that, I think we're better with the best of both worlds. We get \u00a31200 per head more than England and Wales in public expenditure invested in Scotland. We're stronger as a 63m pool of people as opposed to 5m pool of people and that gives you that protection. Why would you move from that situation to a system where there's \u00a36bn less in your budget? That would severely undermine Scotland being able to develop as an economy and pursue policies of fairness and justice. That is one of the myths of the Yes campaign that we would see more fairness and justice. How can you get that if you've actually got less money in your country? That's my fundamental issue. It's not about whether I feel better with Scotland being on its own, it's what I think's best for people in Rutherglen/Cambuslang and I look at what Yes are proposing and I genuinely believe there would be less money and what that means for my constituents we are not able to address the issues of housing, a better NHS, better support in schools, repairing the roads, getting more police on the street for the security and safety of all our citizens. These issues can't be addressed in an independent Scotland with \u00a36bn less to spend.\n\nThere's been a lot of back and forth on many issues with each said bringing out an \"expert\" to back their views. What makes you so confident your version is correct, won't the answer be somewhere in the middle?\n\nJK: What makes me confident that what I am arguing for in this referendum is right is because daily I speak to people in Rutherglen/Cambuslang and I know that their concerns are. They continually say to me there are too many unanswered questions about this. 'We're worried about our jobs, we're worried about our currency, our pensions.' There's too much risk attached to it and people prefer the model we've got with the protection of a larger UK market, the advantage of \u00a31200 a head additional public expenditure They prefer that, a stronger Scottish Parliament as opposed to the risk and recklessness that would come with independence that would ultimately be a disaster for local people in Cambuslang/Rutherglen.\n\nYes seem confident nothing much will change, would everyday life really change?\n\nJK: I reiterate we need to look at the consequences of the decision. We need to look at the evidence on the table from both sides. What No are putting forward is that we currently have a system that protects and supports people in local communities like Rutherglen/Cambuslang by giving them \u00a31200 additional public expenditure over what people get in England and Wales. If you want to say 'let's take control of our own destiny and cut off the rest of England, Wales, Northern Ireland,' that's fine, but that decision has consequences. For instance, those consequences would mean we would struggle to deal with the issues we spoke about earlier, social deprivation in Halfway and Whitlawburn. We need more housing in Halfway and Whitlawburn, we need more amenities in Halfway and Whitlawburn and these would not be addressed in an independent Scotland, so people might want to argue about taking control of our own destiny but I will not stand back and allow a situation that will mean the communities I represent will be worse off.\n\nHave Better Together failed to present reasons to be proud to be British?\n\nJK: I know the point you're trying to make, but I don't actually agree with that. I think there's been quite a change over the last couple of years since the Olympics and I think you get more people saying they're proud to be British and I think you just need to look at the Commonwealth Games as an example. People were very open, they recognised and supported the other countries in the UK and that was a real step change in people's attitude. I don't think Scotland is an insular country, I think we are open, I think we recognised the role the UK plays and they want to be part of that. I suppose it's about confidence, confidence to come out and say that and state that. One of the negative aspects of the campaign has been that the Yes campaign has been very aggressive, it's been in people's faces, there's been some intimidation of No supporters and that might have constrained some of that enthusiasm from speaking out and being British.\n\nDo you think the Commonwealth Games will have an affect on the vote? Surely it proves we can stand tall on our own on the world stage or does it show we can be confident within the Union?\n\nJK: The Games were a great success, a great tribute to Glasgow and also Scotland as a whole being able to put on an event like that and I think it shows that operating as part of the UK we are able to do that, we are able to celebrate. A lot of people came up from England to enjoy it and they socialised with a lot of local people. There was a real coming together as a result of the Games and I think it showed the value of the traditions that we can celebrate within the UK.\n\nEntering the last few weeks, there seems to be this groundswell for Yes online and in the polls, how do you stop that before September 18 and can you stop it after September 18? Are we on an inevitable slide towards independence even if there's a no vote?\n\nJK: I speak to people every day and I've done this for some time, I do it as a constituency MSP, and as a No campaigner. I speak to people and I'm convinced the issues of jobs, currency, pensions and a stronger Scottish Parliament are the issues that are in tune with people on the doorstep and that's what people are looking for. As we enter this final phase, the thing that strikes me, when you go into the final phase a lot of the targeting will be towards the 'don't knows' and what a lot of people who don't know are telling me is they still feel there's too many risks and feel there's too many unanswered questions and the Yes campaign are not going to be able to answer those questions in the final two weeks. A lot of the don't knows are therefore leaning towards No. In terms of the no campaign we will work flat out from now until September 18th, speaking to thousands of people converting people to the No case and getting people to the polls in support of a no position and I'm confident we will achieve that. In terms of post-September 18, there's no doubt it's been a really heated debate, not just among politicians, but it's been heated in the streets. People talk about it everywhere. I got on a train the other day coming back from Edinburgh, it was the day of the Killers concert, four young guys and they started talking about the referendum, you'd never have thought that. Everyone is talking about it and people have really strong views on it and the job post September 18 is that we need to recognise whatever the result is, we've had the debate, the decision has been taken and we now need to move ahead and address a lot of the issues and concerns that people have raised on the campaign trail and make sure people come together and respect each other. I think there's been a lack of respect at times from the Yes campaign, they've tried to devalue certain people's opinions and I don't think that's right, I don't think that's fair, but there's a duty on all of us, the Yes and No campaign, Yes and No politicians, to recognise that once the decision is taken we need to move forward and come together and address the issues that are important to people so that we do get a fairer and more just society. I want to see that within the UK, but whatever the vote we must move forward together.\n\nHas the debate been good for Scotland or divisive?\n\nJK: In general the debate has been good. You and I have spoke about this over the years, one of the problems over the years with politics is we've seen decline in turnouts, therefore there's less interest in politics. I think that makes the democratic process poorer. One of the things we've seen as a result of this debate is that people are genuinely interested. when I go out and campaign and I knock on doors people are now delighted to see you. They want to talk about the issues, they want to chat. Usually people can't get politicians off their doorstep quick enough. Now it's the other way round, sometimes it's difficult to get away from people and I think that's great. That's a genuinely positive side of it. We have seen an unfortunate side to it. Some of the atmosphere around Twitter and Facebook has been quite nasty at times and the way we've seen individuals targeted like JK Rowling, that's not what we want. Whatever your political view, you've got to respect other people's. You can really, strongly disagree with people but you can still respect their view. Margo MacDonald who passed away back in April at the start of the campaign, I got on really well with her, at her memorial her husband Jim Sillars made the point that you can strongly disagree but still remain on good terms with each other and I think that's what we've got to get on to. We want to see plenty of debate, we want to see plenty of passion, we want to see plenty of discussion but we don't want to see some of the nastiness that we've seen during this campaign, particularly on social media.\n\nThere are people who have said they won't accept the decision who are almost religiously one way or the other. How do you go about placating them, from your point of view, if there's a no vote?\n\nJK: I'll accept the result whatever the outcome. If there's a yes vote I accept that, that's the decision the countries made and we need to move on with that and others have to do the same. In Cambuslang and Rutherglen you used to get 80 per cent turnout - over 80 per cent - turnout at elections. For the first time in a generation we're going to see a massive turnout in Cambuslang/Rutherglen on referendum day and I think that's really positive but what that also means is everyone has had the opportunity to have their say, everyone has had their chance to vote, that's democracy in action. And once the country reaches that decision, you can't then turn and say 'well we want another.' You can't keep going back over the referendum process, we've reached a decision and I think people on both sides need to respect that and I don't think it will help the atmosphere of the country going forward if people on the Yes side refuse to accept the decision. I would appeal to people on all side, whether its yes or no, I'm committed that if it's a yes vote I'll accept that decision and I will urge Yes supporters to do likewise because if it's a no decision we need to move this country forward because there's a lot to deal with in our local areas and you can't deal with the issues if you're spending all your time debating the constitutional settlement.\n\nWe either wake up on September 19 knowing whether we stay in the union or leave the union. If it is a Yes vote, where do the unionist parties go? What would be best for Scotland in the event of a Yes vote?\n\nJK: What Labour has been doing and will continue to do until September 18th is to point out the hypocrisy of the SNP's agenda. The SNP are trying to make themselves out to be a left of centre party, more committed to social justice and therefore more committed to Labour values, but let's look at the evidence. I tried to change the law in the Scottish Parliament so that everyone in the public sector would be paid a Living Wage. The SNP, with the Tories, voted against that. Come and independent Scotland one of the first things Alex Salmond would do is take half a billion pounds out of the Scot Parliament budget and give it to bigger businesses and that will not help achieve fairness and equality. I think it's pointing out the myths of the SNP's agenda and commitment to Labour values. Let's not forget it was the SNP voted with the Tories in 1979 to bring in the dawn of Thatcherism, that's the history of the SNP so we will continue to make the Labour case strongly that we have got the best of both worlds, we've got a strong Scottish Parliament which will give us additional borrowing powers that will allow us to build more houses and allow us to build a fairer society in contrast to an independent Scotland which would have less money that would mean we would struggle to address the big issues that Scotland needs to face and would not be in tune with the agenda that Labour would pursue.\n\nThis campaign is not about the SNP though, it's about an independent Scotland.....\n\nJK: If you look at parliamentary representation and votes at elections then the SNP are by far the biggest part of the Yes campaign. One of their main items of propaganda is the White Paper and that was published by the SNP Government, therefore it seems only natural that a lot of the arguments are around the SNP. If there was an independent Scotland, from the political people on the Yes side, the bulk of them would be supporting the SNP. I think it's reasonable to look at what the SNP are proposing. What I would say to Yes people who are not SNP supporters is, you need to look at what the SNP are proposing in an independent Scotland, so if you want to achieve the Living Wage, if you want to build more houses, if you want a better NHS, how do you achieve that if you take half a billion of corporation tax out the system? I don't think you do. That's the issue that non-SNP Yes supporters need to address.\n\nIf we do vote No, how do you restore people's faith in the Union? People want change regardless.\n\nJK: First and foremost we all need to accept the result whatever it is. Moving forward what is required is that we need to use the additional powers that are already coming down the line of \u00a32bn extra borrowing and tax powers to enhance the Scottish Parliament, to use that extra money to address some of the issues that local people are looking for and we need to get additional powers further to that, for example that will give us more power to build more houses through devolution of housing benefit, that will give us the power to create more jobs through controlling our local work problems and also give more power to our local authorities. I think too much power has been taken away to the centre from local council. It's about moving forward with pace on a new political agenda that recognises these additional powers and actually uses the powers to make a difference and to deal with some of the issues that people are looking to be addressed in Rutherglen and cambuslang and I recognise that's got to be an absolute priority for the No supporters post-September 18 if we've to play our part in rebuilding the country and bringing the country back together.\n\nWhat is the future of the Union?\n\nJK: The union has served us well over 300 years, it's given us great institutions like the NHS. It's shown a power to develop, we've had the Scot Parliament which is a great success and I think we can enhance that Scot Parliament to help local people. After this if there's No vote in Scotland we want to be a strong Scottish country but we want that to be within the UK and I think we can go on to boost the strength of the union.",

                    "body": "The narrow gap between the Yes and No camps regarding Scottish independence has started to cause a sense of panic, certainly in Westminster. VoR's Tim Ecott spoke to Ronald MacDonald, Adam Smith Professor of Political Economy at the University of Glasgow.\n\nDavid Cameron is travelling to Scotland to help the No campaign joined by Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband. And Downing Street has already started flying the Scottish flag from the roof.\n\nReports from the City of London warn of impending financial chaos if Scotland says Yes to independence and fears that Scottish home owners may be refused mortgages in the meantime.\n\nRonald MacDonald said: \"My concern is there seems to be a disconnect between the narrowing of the polls and the underlying economic realities. There is so much uncertainty over the currency because the Scottish government wants to retain a formal link with the Sterling currency union. That has been ruled out by Westminster.\n\nThe Scottish government maintains that it wants to have 100 percent flexibility over its fiscal policy which is not consistent with being part of a monastery union without political union. It means your policies could be ill disciplined and essentially expect English tax payers to bail you at.\n\n\"Scotland's 'plan b' will be to hold onto the pound anyway, which would be disastrous for the Scottish economy because the large Scottish financial sector would no longer have a lender of last resort.\n\n\"The Scottish government are making promises to the public to persuade them to vote yes in the referendum but there is no clear plan where the money will come from. The Scottish balance of payments is not in a very healthy position despite having North Sea oil. There are no plans to have foreign exchange reserves so we really are facing an economic meltdown here if people vote yes.\n\n\"The problem is there has been a polarisation between the Yes and No camps. The No side are seen as scaremongering. There is an increasing disbelief that the Better Together campaign has been scaremongering. I believe that's wrong as I believe the numbers are truly scary.\n\n\"We are seeing something akin to herd behaviour where people are beginning to act in a kind of mania and disconnected from economic realities. They are involved in a carnival. I find that deeply worrying as it could push the yes vote over the line and we will have to face the reality on the 19th of September.",

                    "body": "In a five part series, Ian Swanson looks back at the key moments in the independence debate. Part 2: 1980s\n\nMARGARET Thatcher personified Westminster's hostility to Scottish home rule - but had it not been for her, Scotland might not be where it is today.\n\nThe Iron Lady dominated politics throughout the 1980s at the head of a Conservative government, repeatedly re-elected with comfortable majorities and pursuing controversial right-wing policies from privatisation to the poll tax, but without a mandate from Scotland.\n\nThe failure of Labour's 1979 Scottish Assembly referendum, quickly followed by the Tories' general election victory saw devolution effectively taken off the agenda for most of the decade.\n\nBut the policies pursued by Mrs Thatcher and their impact on Scotland fuelled fresh demands for home rule, which led eventually to the creation of the Scottish Parliament and gave the SNP the platform for the independence referendum.\n\nHowever, at the start of the 1980s, the SNP, reduced from 11 MPs to just two at the 1979 election, was in poor shape.\n\nIn the wake of the devolution referendum - which produced a Yes majority, but not a big enough vote to meet the rules - Margo MacDonald argued the SNP could only advance by winning over the working class and needed to become more socialist.\n\nShe helped form the 79 Group inside the party - which also included Alex Salmond, Kenny MacAskill, Roseanna Cunningham and Stewart Stevenson. It produced high quality campaign materials and put up candidates for internal party positions. But traditionalists in the party, who preferred to avoid ideology as much as possible, reacted against its criticisms and in 1982 seven key members of the 79 Group were expelled, including Messrs Salmond and MacAskill.\n\nThe year before, the SNP conference backed a motion calling for \"political strikes and civil disobedience on a mass scale\" and Jim Sillars - who had joined the SNP after the collapse of his breakaway Scottish Labour Party - was put in charge of the new policy of \"Scottish Resistance\". In October 1981, he led a break-in at the old Royal High School, which had been converted to house the Assembly that never was. The group had planned to read out a declaration on what the Scottish Assembly would have done to counter unemployment, but they were arrested before they had the chance.\n\nAcross the UK, the early 1980s were a time of recession and high unemployment. In 1982, the number of people out of work reached three million for the first time since the early 1930s.\n\nScotland was particularly hard hit, with a string of major factory closures and a steady erosion of its traditional industries. The Singer sewing machine plant in Clydebank shut in 1980, throwing 3000 out of work; another 2000 went when Dunlop closed its tyre plant at Inchinnan, Renfrewshire; 6000 jobs went when the Peugeot Talbot factory at Linwood - former home of the Hillman Imp - closed in 1981.\n\nIn Leith, Henry Robb Shipbuilders - which used to occupy the site where Ocean Terminal now stands - closed in 1984 with the loss of 700 jobs.\n\nAnd the Leyland truck plant in Bathgate, which had once employed 6000, shut in 1986.\n\nThe year-long miners' strike which began in 1984 marked another key stage in Scotland's de-industrialisation and also increased the bitterness many Scots felt towards the Thatcher government. This reached its crescendo, though, with the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland a year ahead of the rest of the UK.\n\nNo matter that it was done in response to complaints about rates revaluation, the injustice of a tax which made the \"dustman pay the same as a duke\" seemed all the greater when it was imposed by a Tory party which had just ten of the 72 Scottish MPs.\n\nDespite all this anger, the SNP failed to make much electoral progress for most of the Eighties. It still had just two MPs after the 1983 general election and only added one more in 1987 - though that was a 32-year-old Alex Salmond.\n\nAnd the following year Jim Sillars won a stunning victory at a by-election in Govan, repeating the triumph his wife Margo MacDonald had won 15 years earlier.\n\nWell aware of Thatcherism's unpopularity in Scotland, the prime minister visited the Church of Scotland's General Assembly in 1988 and tried to explain her market ideology in theological terms. Her \"Sermon on The Mound\" did not go down well - ministers and elders queued up to register their dissent before she had even spoken. And at the end of her speech, the Moderator presented her with copies of two Kirk reports highly critical of her government's policies.\n\nDespite the apparent collapse of interest in devolution in the wake of the 1979 referendum, a cross-party Campaign for a Scottish Assembly had been set up in 1980, led among\n\nothers by Jim Boyack, father of the now Lothian Labour MSP Sarah Boyack. It paved the way, towards the end of the decade, for the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which brought together churches, trade unions, businesses, Labour, the Lib Dems, Greens and others to draw up a blueprint for a Scottish Parliament - though the SNP and the Tories stayed out. The convention had its first meeting on March 30, 1989, in the Church of Scotland General Assembly Hall - the place where Mrs Thatcher had delivered her Sermon on The Mound. Those present put their names to a \"Claim of Right\" asserting the \"sovereign right\" of the Scottish people to choose their own form of government.\n\nAnd in a rousing speech, Canon Kenyon Wright, who chaired the convention's executive, spoke of the battle ahead to secure devolution and referred to the most obvious obstacle, the lady at Number Ten: \"What if that voice we know so well says 'We say No and we are the state'? Well, we say Yes and we are the people.\"",

One that won't go away\", political debate has ensued over the matter, that concerns landscapes either sides of the Pacific.\n\nBritain's chief problems and one that the queen faces herself is the inherited visage of the nation (England) has been trying to shed, of its imperial yesteryears before the end of the Empire half a century ago. As the Irish, pout and look on with bloated cheeks, Britain stands to lose another working limb.\n\nWhat is perhaps admirable, and also alarmingly degenerative of the command David Cameron and his team hold over the functioning of the British Isles, is the way in which the referendum has been eased onto his desk.\n\nCameron has called upon the Queen - who herself awaits the verdict on whether Scotland, if freed, would take her as queen - to convince his fellow islanders on voting against the referendum.\n\nThe referendum, itself is a one-of-its-kind charter that would require everyone above the age of 16, currently residing in Scotland to vote against the simple question - \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"\n\nThe Scottish move for independence is a drab revision of the circumstances the Empire encountered during the uprising of yet another family member, the Irish.\n\nThe push for Irish identity, and freedom during the early years of the 21 century marred the idea of 'Britain' beyond repair. While the pathos of the time was marked in works by literary stalwarts such as Joyce himself, and theorists that followed him, the same cannot be said about the yet-to-convince Scots.\n\nOn one hand, the Irish uprising, coupled with an overbearing search for identity sans 'generally British' left an indelible print on life, and literary discourse that ensued in the aftermath of a war that reshaped Europe - not only geographically. As compared - taking into consideration the post-modern etiquette of existence - the Scottish movement has been anything but the same tour de force'.\n\nThere have been names, both belonging to literary factions, and otherwise, who have claimed sides opposite the tipping point. Sean Connery, perhaps the most celebrated supporter of independence believes this is an opportunity too good to let go. J K Rowling, author of the famous Harry Potter series thinks otherwise.\n\nA recent survey, suggested that in over a year, since the referendum was first suggested, at least 10 % percent of the Scottish residents have grown to feel \"less-Scottish\". The facts, and educated opinion suggests, Britian would avoid a landmark sway in belief, as it failed to do during the Irish war for Independence.\n\nThe glib mark of another mutilation aside, there are consequences both parties need to take into account. There is the economic hangover of choosing a currency - Will Scotland keep the pound? Will they adopt the Euro?\n\nThere is also the added baggage of UK's national debt, something Scotland will be set to inherit (between \u00a3100bn and \u00a3130bn). The UK will have to consider withdrawing from its naval stations from Scotland's ports - at least by the 2020, Salmond says.\n\nWhatever the verdict of the referendum come on the day of voting, the occasion cements yet another scar on the nation's history; a history that Briton's themselves struggle to shrug or adequately acknowledge as ghosts of their imperial past continue to resurface as harvest of the proverbial \"as you sow\" - from over international borders in America, Africa, Asia and Oceania.",

                    "body": "From the pound to the NHS, the perils conjured by either side cancel each other out - and romance has the advantage\n\n\"Maybe it would be a mistake,\" the tweed-jacketed man in the Glasgow bookshop told me as he surveyed the shelves dedicated to referendum literature. \"But at least it would be our mistake.\" I have heard more fervent statements of intent to vote yes next week but none that so deftly probes the limitations of the unionist campaign.\n\nThe spectre of the big mistake - the irreversible, job-shedding, wealth-shrinking bad call - has been central to the no campaign. The logic was simple: Scots with a strong emotional attachment to Britain were in the bag, and undecideds would not be won over by abstract appeals to cross-border kinship. Theirs would be a decision based on economic self-interest. They needed convincing that independence was a dangerous gamble with Scotland's prosperity, and Alex Salmond could easily depicted as a chancer. As one Better Together strategist put it to me when sketching the assault on the credibility of his opponents: \"It may not be pretty, but it works.\" And it did work for a while. Then it stopped working.\n\nThe Better Together team was confident at the start of the summer that the bulk of pollsters' \"don't knows\" were ready to break for no. Their research found evidence of \"shy no\" voices in the undecided crowd, often expressed as resentment at being made to choose at all, or as dismay at the way new, hostile borders were being drawn - not between Scotland and England but between friends, across pub tables and families.\n\nAbove all, Better Together had been counting on the perils of independence to close the deal with doubters, and discharged its ammunition accordingly. What about the currency? The national debt? Pensions? EU membership? Nato? Did we mention the currency? But the no side failed to anticipate the potency of a counter-spectre conjured by the yes camp. This was the apparent peril of being shackled to England and the Conservatives in perpetuity; the risk to the NHS and the welfare state of David Cameron's union.\n\nThe rebuttal that devolution already mitigates those dangers has not been getting much traction. In the game of competitive fear-mongering, the yes campaign is winning when it creates a feeling of equivalent risk everywhere, so that voters are made dizzy with numbers, their eyes glazing over at another data-laden argument about economics and institutions. Then the advantage goes to the campaign with romance on its side. Because if there are mistakes to be made either way, it feels right to take the path of indigenously Scottish mistakes.\n\nThat proposition only resonates because Better Together has failed to make this a campaign about two national visions - both patriotic, both equally Scottish, but one cut off from the UK and the other connected. Instead, Salmond has been free to insert his preferred subtext to the referendum, so to many Scots the ballot paper will now ask: \"Who owns the future - us or them?\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, the polls have narrowed, striking unique terror into Labour hearts. On a practical level it is difficult for Ed Miliband to form a parliamentary majority without Scottish MPs. But there is a deeper dismay at being rejected by parts of the Scottish electorate that could once be relied upon to show tribal allegiance to Labour. It is disorienting for a party that has woven an electoral security blanket from regional hatreds of Tories to find itself cast as part of a Conservative-branded establishment, in league with the enemy.\n\nThe Tories don't like being the bogeyman in Scotland but are used to it. They have also had more exposure to implacable anti-Westminster feeling because, in its English manifestation as Ukip, it has been ripping their party apart. Nigel Farage and Salmond are unalike in many respects, but they share the nationalist's trick of fashioning every problem into an alien yoke, whether imposed by Brussels or England, that can be cast off in a single bound.\n\nThe potency of this type of politics lies in advocating leaps of faith. No one can say for sure that Britain would be worse off outside the EU, and no one can say for sure that Scotland would be poorer independent, because it hasn't been tried. But if the people peddling gloom are the same politicians who brought you the MPs' expenses scandal, the financial crisis and endless budget austerity, what have you to lose?\n\nRather a lot is the truthful answer, since turbulent global economic waters are more dangerous for a small nation than for one that unites with its neighbours. But that is the politics of caution, of cost-benefit analysis and evidence-waving enumeration of risk. Such considerations bounce off converts to the politics of place, identity, belonging and emancipation: power for us; freedom from them.\n\nScotland may well yet decide to stick with the union. But even a rejection of full independence will leave Britain fractured. With the no camp desperately offering more generous devolution terms - \"the best of both worlds,\" they call it - the status quo isn't even on the ballot paper. The campaign has revealed the same language barrier between Westminster and voters that has been in evidence in every council election, by-election and European election this parliament. The proposition that business should carry on as usual has found very few takers in Scotland. No one should be surprised if in next year's general election it turns out the rest of the UK feels much the same.",

In the old South Africa, the majority population were the victims of a cruelly oppressive regime that denied them the vote and cut them off from the nation's life.\n\nIn contrast, Scots have been embraced for more than 300 years as full and revered partners in the United Kingdom.\n\nIndeed, in many areas - literature, the arts, philosophy, commerce, invention, discovery, theology, the military, politics - Scots have been dominant in our island story, while each nation of the Union would have been diminished without the others.\n\nScotland has given us kings, queens and prime ministers, great scientists and generals - and explorers and administrators who helped found the world's largest and most benign empire.\n\nAn oppressed people? Today, they receive more public money per head than the rest of Britain.\n\nBut in one thing, the disingenuous Mr Salmond is right. His opponents in the No camp are indeed in 'total panic'.\n\nHow have we come to this, with the comfortable lead for the Union cause whittled away to nothing - and only eight days before a vote whose significance to 60million people can't be exaggerated?\n\nPart of the answer, as this paper has argued for weeks, has been the constant negativity of Better Together.\n\nOf course there is force behind the warnings that a separatist Scotland would face enormous risks to its economy and social fabric, with not only its currency but its membership of the EU, border arrangements, defences, pensions and finances in the gravest doubt.\n\nBut the warnings have been delivered in a patronising, bullying tone that might have been calculated to offend a justly proud nation.\n\nMeanwhile, the No campaign's sheer complacency has been astonishing.\n\nUnforgivably, almost no serious planning seems to have been done, while much of the talking has been left to discredited, uninspiring Labour politicians, many of whom can't stand each other.\n\nWhat does it tell us about Westminster, when even the lightweight Mr Salmond can run rings round his opponents?\n\nIndeed, Britain's entire political class - most of all the egregious Ed Miliband, with his insulting assurance that Scotland needn't worry, because Labour will win in 2015 - should hang its head in shame.\n\nBut this is not the time for recriminations. The pressing question is how the No campaign should be conducted in the little time remaining. There, the first advice must surely be: calm down!\n\nNothing could be more reckless than the attempts to draw up, in days, a back-of-the-envelope programme of 'devo-max', with vast implications for a constitution that has evolved over centuries.\n\nDavid Cameron may claim this offers Scotland 'the best of both worlds' if they vote No. But it could promise the worst of every world, with the rest of us forced to pick up the bills for Mr Salmond.\n\nAs for the three leaders' dash to Scotland today, doesn't this play into the nationalists' hands - reinforcing the message that English politicians only care about Scots when votes are at stake?\n\nFar more encouraging is the note struck by Mr Cameron in his heartfelt article for the Mail today. At last, the threatening tone has gone, replaced by a moving evocation of our shared glories and an optimistic vision of how the whole UK is greater than the sum of its parts.",

Black people were oppressed and unable to vote, which has never been the case in Scotland.\n\n'It is insulting to anyone involved in democratic elections here over the century and belittles what people went through in South Africa.\n\n'This is typical of Salmond's hyperbole. Scots have always been a key part of running the UK, including with Scottish prime ministers.\n\n'He accuses the No campaign of panicking, but making this comparison is just desperation.'\n\nAnd BBC broadcaster Sue MacGregor, who was raised in South Africa by Scottish parents, said: 'Voting was not possible for many in South Africa until that election, that is why they queued for one or two days to vote. It is not comparable.'\n\nDescribing what he saw in Dundee, Mr Salmond had said: '[It was] almost reminiscent of the scenes in South Africa that some of us of a certain age remember from 20 years ago or so when people queued up to vote in the first free elections.'\n\nMr Salmond yesterday also dismissed reports that the Queen is concerned about the prospect of Scottish independence.\n\nHe said: 'I want the Queen as head of state, as Queen of Scots of an independent Scotland as her ancestors were.\n\n'Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots, and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land.\n\n'I had an audience at Balmoral some two weeks ago, but the proper position is you don't discuss these matters in public.\n\n'The statement from the palace about the Queen's neutrality in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one.'\n\nThe first democratic elections took place in South Africa over three days from 27 to 29 April, 1994. Despite threats of violence, the voting was largely peaceful.\n\nMr Mandela, who had been imprisoned by the apartheid regime for 27 years, became the country's first black president after his ANC party won 62.5 per cent of the votes.\n\nThe parliament in Holyrood was formed in 1999 following the referendum campaigned for by Donald Dewar two years previously.\n\nIts powers including running the health service and education north of the border. Since 1707 there have been 12 prime ministers who were either Scots-born or of Scottish extraction.\n\nJim Murphy, Labour MP for East Renfrewshire, who lived in South Africa for several years as a child before returning to Scotland, said: 'To compare any vote in Scotland, no matter how important, with South Africa's first ever democratic election is crass.\n\n'Scotland is not Soweto and a decision on whether or not we stay British has no parallels at all with the beauty of the liberation of South Africa from the evil type of racism that was apartheid.'",

As the referendum draws closer, the Yes camp is going up in the polls and, according to a YouGov survey, may have a narrow lead.\n\nJust a few weeks back, after the first televised debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, it seemed all but over for the SNP. Several businesses, the Bank of England, the Chancellor, Labour, the Lib Dems, the Tories - all want Scotland to stay in the Union and warn of dire consequences if it goes its own way.\n\nI, too, would like the British nation to stay as one, because it is a sustainable polity within which various histories have a place. Yet I also understand Scottish independence hopes and so admire the Yes side's spirit. We should thank them for shaking up natural British complacence and inertia.\n\nScots wanting out are not Ukipy, or lazily nationalistic. They are buzzing, talking, thinking, debating, really looking at the past and future. They are looking at democracy, what it is and what it can be. How can we not be impressed by that?\n\nWestern democracy risks being destroyed by internal torpor and cynicism, as well as by external forces, among them Islamicist zealots and Russian imperialism. The Scots put to shame the career disgruntled and disengaged. And they remind us how vital it is to fight for political ideals.\n\nThis is not just about kicking the Tories, or provoking the English. Many Yes voters decided to join the camp after months of patronising and at times horribly insulting statements and warnings from leading lights in England.\n\nAt the weekend, for example, these choice words were published in Right-wing newspapers: \"[A Yes vote] will usher in a 'banana republic of tax and turmoil\"; \"Scotland will be poorer, more unstable and will require deeper cuts in public spending than if it remains part of the UK\".\n\nIn the meantime, Ed Miliband was praised for wanting to build a new Hadrian's Wall and the Queen and Prince Charles were said to be \"horrified\" by the very thought of Scottish independence.\n\nDavid Cameron was due to meet the monarch at Balmoral, perhaps to hatch further, inept plots. But you cannot fool, or scare people into remaining in a partnership.\n\nThere is now some talk of giving big concessions and powers to Scotland. So, whatever happens, the SNP wins. It will have been worth all the aggro and drama.\n\nThis exercise is more than simply a grab for more power. It is a battle of ideologies, too. In Scotland, though big business behaves badly - and there is an Edinburgh elite which is just as self-serving as that in London - few people seem to want the manic and ruthless Anglo-Saxon social, or economic, model.\n\nThey incline towards the Scandinavian nations, which various studies have found to be more equal and more content than the UK and US. They also believe in the EU project and don't share the sour views of many anti-EU Englanders.\n\nI spoke to several Scotsmen and women who do not want to leave the EU and who ask, pointedly, why they are lectured on the benefits of the Union by the same people who hate being part of Europe. Good question.\n\nUnions are good for all of us and it would be a shame to give up on the historical hopes and aspirations that made the United Kingdom.\n\nBut I think we should give due respect to the Scots for this political probe, test and new settlement. And learn from them about heartfelt citizenship engagement.",

                    "body": "Scotland has never been so close to exiting the UK. This crucial debate matters for all of us Europeans because what is at stake is the essence of European unity: we are better and stronger together.\n\nCloser and closer to the edge\n\nOn Monday 8 September for the first time in the Scottish referendum campaign, a poll gave a tight lead to the Yes vote (47% Yes, 45% No, 8% undecided). This compares to a 22-point lead for the No barely two months ago, which melt to a 6-point lead last week, before the Yes vote eventually took the lead. Although several analysts warned that this was only one poll, and other polls indicate that the race is too close to call, the current trend is clearly in favour of the Yes.\n\nSince the beginning of the Referendum campaign, the \"Yes Scotland\" and \"Better Together\" campaigns have been bitterly debating the pros and cons of the 307-year-old union. In this debate, several public figures (including Queen Elizabeth II) in the UK and elsewhere in Europe have adopted a \"neutral\" position, arguing this was a matter purely for the Scots to decide, thereby implying that this debate, of political unity versus disintegration, mattered only for the Scots. This is fundamentally wrong: the Scottish debate could have been held in exactly the same terms in Catalonia, the Basque Country, Belgium, and any other part of Europe with regionalist aspirations. This debate is particularly tricky as it combines on the one hand legitimate aspirations for more decentralisation and autonomy (promoted by the European Union through the subsidiarity principle), and on the other hand obnoxious nationalistic and hatred-driven claims.\n\nDistinguishing legitimate aspirations from nationalism\n\nSome regionalist aspirations are perfectly legitimate and often justified by the need for local democracy, so that people feel they can have a direct impact on their day-to-day lives, which makes them feel empowered and responsible, or simply efficiency: if things are better done locally, why take them up to the national level? However, such arguments are often used by nationalists or \"regionalists\" with much distinct objectives: gain full independence from a hated wider entity they belong to. This instrumentalisation of legitimate arguments by nationalists takes place everywhere in Europe and could, if blindly accepted, simply lead to the disintegration of our continent and of the European project.\n\nThe key to distinguishing these two similar but very distinct aspirations lies in the \"exclusivity\" of people's sense of belonging. Identities are multiple, particularly in Europe where two thousand years of history have produced unique and very peculiar socio-economic and cultural patterns. This diversity can be approached in two different ways: one can either feel exclusively rooted to one specific identity (a city, a region, a country, etc.), or accept that identities can be cumulative and complimentary. The European project is obviously built on the second interpretation: \"my Region, my Country, and Europe\" constitute the wholly trinity of identity in our old continent. Any political discourse which calls for the exclusivity of one of these three pillars (including those who call for an \"exclusively European\" identity which obliterates regions and countries) are fundamentally wrong and verge on the side of totalitarianism - as they seek to impose a unique and exclusive identity upon inherently diverse people. The Scottish referendum is clearly part of this enterprise and hence should not be interpreted as a gentle claim for more autonomy.\n\nThe illusion of absolute independence\n\nOne of the most important questions in the campaign was whether the UK would accept to share the Pound Sterling with a new independent Scotland. Any realistic solution would involve some form of a currency union (whether with the UK or the EUrozone): in such a scenario, how can the nationalists even begin to believe they will achieve a better deal than what they currently have through independence? Just ask the Greeks, Irish, Portuguese, Cypriots and Spanish what \"independence\" within a currency union feels like. The euro crisis has shown how unsustainable a currency union is without a political union... which is exactly what the Scots and the UK currently have! As Mark Carney (Governor of the Bank of England) recently put it, \"a currency union is incompatible with sovereignty\". An independent Scotland using the Pound would reduce - not increase - its autonomy from London. In a globalised world, the only way to preserve sovereignty is to share it, and Scotland's current position is better than any deal it could achieve through independence.\n\nPro-European? Really?\n\nOne of Alex Salmon's arguments is the following: we want to exit the United Kingdom because we want to stay in the EU, which the UK might leave in 2017. This burst of Europhilia seemed rather odd coming from a nationalist. Indeed, if nationalists say they are so \"culturally different\" from the rest of the UK that they need independence, then how on earth are they going to handle diversity with the French, Spanish, Italians, Poles, Estonians, Greeks, and all other European nations within the EU? Europe is about Unity in Diversity, at every level: one cannot apply this motto at the European level and disregard it at the national level. UK Prime Minister David Cameron is also finding himself in the awkward position of being on both sides of the debate at the same time: promoting all the benefits of Unity in Diversity, a single market and political cooperation at the UK level, whilst arguing for exactly the opposite at the European level.\n\nFurthermore, a Scottish secession from the UK could well produce \"butterfly effects\" such as European disintegration: a reduced UK would be more Conservative-dominated and hence more likely to leave the EU, other regions (starting with Catalonia) would increase pressure to achieve independence, whilst all other nationalist movements (at regional or national level) would seek to catch the wave of disintegration. And we all know where Europe can end up if it is disintegrated.\n\nHence, dear Scottish friends, on 18 September 2014, say No to Nationalism, and Yes to Unity: we are always better and stronger together!",

                    "body": "John Major is a decent man who has entered the Scottish referendum debate because he is alarmed at the prospect that the UK might break up, causing serious problems for us all - not least Scots. But he is wrong to blame Labour for the looming crisis. It's not the right time for recrimination, and besides (how can we put this gently?) there have been failures of leadership and vision in all parties.\n\nIn Wednesday's Times (paywall), Sir John's main thrust is that Labour's \"deadly legacy\" was the one-sided 1998 Devolution Act, which did not address the governance of the rest of the UK that needed devolved powers - and still do.\n\nArguably worse, Labour connived with the nationalists in the 1980s and 90s to \"demonise the Conservatives and, by implication, the English\" despite the \"revolution in living standards\" that Tory policies made possible in both countries, Major writes.\n\nThere's some truth in that. You can see the same process at work now in Labour's attacks on the coalition's management of the NHS. It disowns the Blair/Brown era's reformism in opening it up to choice and competition, including some private sector provision. Late in the day the yes campaign has deployed near-identical tactics to claim that NHS Scotland is only safe in Alex Salmond's hands, the self-styled Nelson Mandela of the north.\n\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of Jeremy Hunt's NHS England strategy, it's a pretty bogus argument on both sides of the wall. Scots have wholly run their own health system since 1999 - and Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon have since 2007 (did Sturgeon quit as health minister before her chickens came home to roost?); they face identical problems of squeezed budgets, rising costs and (even more) rapidly ageing customers.\n\nThey've done some things differently, some better (bravely pioneered that smoking ban), others worse (ducked hospital closures and handed out free scrips to millionaires). You get my point. But nowhere in Major's article does the word 'Thatcher' appear. Nor even 'Cameron'.\n\nThose two omissions are not hard to figure out. In her economic and industrial policies, Lady Thatcher was an even more divisive and insensitive figure in Adam Smith's native land than further south. She also famously lectured Church of Scotland leaders, much as Mary, Queen of Scots did the Ayatollah John Knox (and we know what happened to her). She thought they should be grateful; in some respects they should, since Scotland has done pretty well lately. But we can see why they are not.\n\nAnd if \"Thatcher' is the dirtiest word in the yes lexicon - followed by \"Thatcherite Blair\", for Major is usually overlooked - then David Cameron has also made what may prove to be fatal mistakes too. But let's save the real inquest until later and savour Murdo MacLeod's lovely campaign photo album here.\n\nOver-sensitive Major's shopping list of horrors - which may flow from what he sees as other people's mistakes - is a better one. The EU will be in no hurry to admit an independent Scotland, and all 28 members have vetoes, not to mention separatists of their own. If Scotland eventually gets in (\"there is no certainty of this\") it will have far less influence in Brussels than in London; 5 million out of 500 million. It is, of course, a weakness in the Tory position, not addressed by Major, that Cameron is playing Salmond-lite in threatening to quit the EU himself.\n\nTrident? Some yes voters think this the most important symbol of the campaign: a \"nuclear-free Scotland\". Major thinks it might be the end of Trident unless it can be relocated at great cost to west Wales or Cornwall. Why would Nato want to re-admit a country that has done such damage to Nato defence, he asks? Again Scottish leftwingers might relish the thought as they build the New McJerusalem.\n\nIt so happens that a Scottish Labour ex-minister who tells me he may vote yes - \"I've always been a 'small n' nationalist\" - also predicts that prime minister Salmond's first betrayal will be to cut a deal over Trident and defence: he just can't afford the loss of jobs and shipbuilding capacity on the Clyde. It will be the first of many unless Wee 'Eck applies to Google to have past promises deleted on privacy grounds.\n\nMajor's spine-chillers do not end there. Can Scotland afford a UK-style network of embassies and attendant inward investment opportunities? No. Will rUK [rest of UK] retain its seat on the UN security council? No. (He may be wrong: UN inertia should never be discounted.) What will happen to the 750,000 Scots living elsewhere in the UK who have no vote next Friday?\n\nAs an ex-chancellor - the one who took us all into the abortive exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the forerunner of the euro, in 1990 (and out again in 1992) - Major echoes familiar, misunderstood arguments against an Anglo-Scots currency union (CU). \"Truly absurd,\" he calls it, when we look at the travails of the eurozone. He's right, though we will have to do something.\n\nLabour Britain decided the euro had been badly designed, but knew it would not be in our interests for it to fail - as it may yet do. By the same test it will not be in rUK's interest to have a depressed or unstable Scottish economy next door (or vice-versa), so if there is to be a divorce we will have to work out a least worst option together - they are all pretty grim - for the sake of the children. Scotland's over-indebted banking system? Let's not go over that one again.\n\nSo Major is on the right track, albeit in a chippy, Major-ish way. Yes or no on 18 September, we face a constitutional upheaval. It may do us all good; the shakeup we needed. But it may unleash the reactionary impulses already visible in the post-imperial era, of introspective and insular English nationalism fuelled by a cynical press and oligarchy. Think Tea Party.\n\nOn their trip north on Wednesday, the three main party leaders had better get it right. Much rests upon it.",

The 34-year-old stands on the doorstep of his semi-detached, pebble-dashed house at the end of a street in Linlithgow, a middle-class town in the middle of Scotland. His young daughter, pretty in a pink princess gown with her face smeared by errant paint, pulls at his Union Jack T-shirt. \"They say it's a gamble worth taking,\" Mr McDonald says of Scottish independence, \"but it shouldn't be a gamble at all.\"\n\nMr McDonald knows the issues. He is worried about losing the Bank of England's lender of last resort function should an independent Scotland fail to secure a currency union with the UK. He sees public spending cuts as necessary to balance the UK's budget rather than an evil plot. He also feels that secession would put at risk what he has worked hard for.\n\nUnable to afford a house in his home town of Edinburgh, Mr McDonald, who works at the nearby Aldi supermarket, moved to cheaper Linlithgow. He has a mortgage, job, children - a stake in the present. Scots such as Mr McDonald help explain why there is a widening class divide in attitudes to independence, according to opinion polls.\n\nIt is those with the most to lose who are scared now that the Yes side has drawn level ahead of the referendum on September 18.\n\nAnd yet it is the voices of these Scots that have been silenced by the explosive Yes campaign led by Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, who was born in Linlithgow in 1954. Listening to the pro-union Better Together volunteers as they canvass, I sense that they are shell-shocked. \"I just wished I'd volunteered sooner,\" Linda Hamilton, 73, says.\n\nLiving across the road from a Scottish National party politician, she watched as the house opposite became festooned with Yes paraphernalia and started buzzing with activists. She sent an email to the No campaign 18 months ago but says she received no call back. \"I feel passionately about this,\" Ms Hamilton says, \"I want all Britain to be fairer.\"\n\nThe volunteers are nice people, perhaps too nice. I recognise this slice of Scotland: it is the Scotland of my parents and our own pebble-dashed street. This is a Scotland that is comfortable, sensible, prudent, genteel and, I fear, complacent. They are quietly angry with Mr Salmond for his recklessness with their future and, to a lesser extent, with the No campaign for giving their opponents a monopoly over emotion. \"I think many of my friends thought that it'll be all right on the night,\" Ms Hamilton says.\n\nIt still might. \"I've voted No in the postal ballot,\" one woman tells me, \"but don't tell anyone.\" Another says that she is undecided but then calls me back and whispers, \"Actually I'm a No but I don't want the street to know.\"\n\nThese are part of the \"silent majority\", Scots who will vote No but who feel cowed by the Yes side. I don't think that this has led to a misleadingly low tally for No in the polls, as some hope. But many No-voting Scots clearly fear expressing their strong pro-union sentiment.\n\nDown the street, when a volunteer knocks on a door, a bellowing sound a bit like a voice is heard from inside: \"F*** off! I am a Yes!\" No wonder his neighbours are reticent.\n\nRude as this recluse may be, he is not the problem for Better Together. The bigger trouble for the No campaign are the likes of Gordon Inglis. It is his 60th birthday and his family is celebrating inside but the former ICI worker is more than happy to chat about his ambivalence. \"I'm a don't know,\" he says, \"but I think I'll vote Yes.\"\n\nMr Inglis is \"a realist\", he adds. He knows that \"nothing is for free\" (he is wary of the subsidised bus pass he received on his birthday, for instance) but he feels that there are \"unknowns on both sides\".\n\nWe discuss the nearby Rosyth shipyard, where the building of Royal Navy aircraft carriers could be put at risk by a Yes vote. \"Possibly,\" Mr Inglish says, \"but the way austerity is going I can't see many ships being built in the future anyway. And Scotland would need a naval fleet of some sort.\"\n\nWhen largely pragmatic voters such as Mr Inglis say there is equivalent risk with a Yes and a No vote, it is a sign of the success the pro-independence side has had in \"de-risking\" the idea of secession. I say that independence is surely riskier. \"I accept it'll cost us,\" he says. \"But sometimes you have to step backwards to step forwards.\"\n\nBefore he returns to his party, Mr Inglis mentions that he went to school with Mr Salmond, who still returns to the town regularly to see his father. \"He was quiet and unassuming\", Mr Inglis recalls. \"I never thought he would be where he is now.\"",

                    "body": "There's a deluge of Scottish independence articles in today's papers. Here are three I found particularly interesting.\n\nBritain is a state but not a nation. Scotland is the opposite -- a nation demanding the right to be recognised as a state. It's time to clarify our terms, so pay attention at the back. A nation is made up of people who think of themselves as belonging together, who conduct, in the philosopher Ernest Renan's memorable phrase, \"a daily plebiscite\" of membership of the nation. The state is the set of political institutions that turn that national feeling into power ...\n\nNot long ago, Mr Miliband was pressed on what England might learn from Scotland. Free bus travel for the elderly, he replied.\n\nThere is a better answer. Although nine out of ten immigrants to Britain live in England, they tell pollsters that they feel British rather than English. The odd neutrality of Britishness is attractive to immigrants for precisely the reason it is so hard to write poetry about -- it is empty and therefore hospitable to newcomers. There is no sense of kith and kin, no hint of blood and belonging. It is a citizen ceremony and a passport. It is an obligation to obey the law but, beyond that, nothing is expected.\n\nHe also argues that Scottish independence would force Labour in England to modernise fully.\n\nThat sorrow does not extend all the way through Labour, by any means. None of them would dream of breaking cover, but there are former Labour cabinet ministers who can see that Britain without Scotland is the short-cut back to new Labour. Tony Blair used to demand that Labour modernise or die so often that it became a standing joke among his entourage. A victory for Alex Salmond would do the job far more comprehensively than Mr Blair ever managed.\n\nAnd he says that Alex Salmond might be quite happy with a no victory that leads to more devolution.\n\nMy guess -- and that's the right word -- is that it will work just enough to give Mr Salmond what I suspect, in his rare quiet moments, he has half always wanted. Some defeats are victories in disguise and this could be one of them.\n\nThey now feel more comfortable than ever before about their Scottish identity because sectarianism has significantly declined, discrimination at work is no more and most enjoy social and educational parity with Scots of all backgrounds.\n\nThe SNP has worked hard to establish close relations with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Alex Salmond has often praised the academic and moral excellence of Catholic schools. His government is committed to keeping faith schools, despite the opposition of many Scots who believe they perpetuate religious divisions.\n\nThe changing nature of Scotland's dual identity may also be relevant. Not so long ago Britishness was more popular than Scottishness. Now that has been reversed. The descendants of Irish immigrants can relate more readily to the modern symbols of secular Scottishness than their grandparents did to the empire, monarchy and Protestantism that sustained British identity in Scotland for so long.",

The \"Save Our NHS\" placards were the real giveaway. As many commentators have noted, the \"Yes\" campaign's threat that Westminister will privatise Scotland's NHS is beyond absurd: it is an outrageous political lie. The Scottish Parliament already controls the country's health service, as it does its education and legal systems.\n\nIt will not require separate statehood to \"protect\" the Scottish health system from being denationalised by Whitehall, because Whitehall has no such power. The \"Save Our NHS\" slogan has nothing to do with Scottish independence. It is a trade union mantra. What the \"Yes\" project is really about now is creating Public Sector Union Heaven north of the border: a socialist utopian fantasy which has not been broached as an electoral possibility since the Eighties when Labour boroughs declared themselves nuclear-free zones and Militant Tendency ran Liverpool as a people's republic (and went bankrupt).\n\nAlex Salmond isn't Braveheart. He is the Hugo Chavez of the North, proposing a society in which every service will be munificently funded and nobody will have to pay for anything because, just as in Chavez's Venezuela, the oil income will provide. Never mind that this bountiful, everlasting fount of wealth is entirely dependent on the world price of oil (which is about to be undercut by the supply of shale oil), and that it is a diminishing resource anyway. The SNP knows this, of course. Its leaders may be brazen liars but they are not in total economic denial. What they are counting on is that England will bail them out in a fit of sentimentality or political self-interest. But the sentimental tie is being exhausted by the foaming idiocy of the \"Yes\" campaign's more irresponsible activists, and there will be very little political leverage when Scotland has no seats at Westminster.\n\nWhat Scotland would become is a kind of East Germany, sitting smack up against its prosperous English neighbour. There would be another flood of migrants heading South to escape the dead-end last redoubt of Old Labour, draining the Scottish economy of youthful talent and ambition. How long before they build a wall along the border?",
