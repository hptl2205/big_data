But it's not just Republicans who feel that way.  DNC Chief Debbie Wasserman Schultz is also skeptical of the amendment.\n In several children with epilepsy, the cannabidiol content (i.e. not the THC) of marijuana has been one of the few effective substances that gives them relief.  The particular strain used for \"Charlotte's Web\" contains very little THC.",

                    "body": "Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott signed a law today that permits limited medical marijuana use in his state.  Specifically, the legislation allows for use of a strain called Charlotte's Web.  Lawmakers in the state achieved bipartisan support for the measure and passed it this spring.\n The progress for medical marijuana use was likely motivated by the passionate pleas from parents who asserted that people who suffer from epileptic seizures may get positive results from taking the drug.  In fact, the type of medical marijuana that was just given the nod of approval by the governor is named for a girl from Colorado who has gotten relief from her debilitating seizures because of marijuana.\n In a statement about his approval of the medical marijuana use, Scott pointed out how he's a father and grandfather and it's never pleasant to see kids who are suffering.  He also indicated a desire to support parents who want to provide their kids with the best possible treatment.\n This freshly-inked law allows for medical marijuana use in cases where people are coping with Lou Gehrig's disease, cancer and epileptic seizures.  Also, the legislation puts strict caps on sales of the marijuana, meaning that sales will be well below what they are in states such as California, where marijuana is legal for recreational use.\n Florida has now joined a total of nearly two dozen states plus the District of Columbia that have some type of legalized medical marijuana use in effect.  In November, the state will have a referendum vote on whether to allow for more widespread adoption of medical marijuana, but this move by the governor is not related to that initiative.\n This strain of medical marijuana is so important to some families who have children suffering from seizures that it has caused some bold parents to uproot their lives and move to Colorado.  There, interested persons must join a waiting list for the drug, but when there is not a shortage, access to that type of medical marijuana is generally easier than in other places around the country.\n Fortunately, there's no need to start feeling alarmed that some kids who are as young as toddlers are being given permission by their parents to get intoxicated by medical marijuana.  The Charlottes Web form comes in an oil format, so it is not smoked.  Also, it has a lower-than-usual quantity of THC, the chemical that makes people high.\n [Image Credit: Al Jazeera America]",

Rick Scott signed a bill Monday that legalizes a form of medical marijuana touted as way to help relieve symptoms for children with epilepsy and cancer patients.\n The Republican-controlled Legislature made a policy about-face this year and passed the bill to legalize a version of medical marijuana that could be used by cancer patients and children with degenerative seizures.\n Scott had already pledged to sign SB 1030, which creates a legal system for producing, dispensing and studying the drug in Florida for patients who are permanent residents of the state with cancer or conditions leading to seizures.\n \"As a father and grandfather, you never want to see kids suffer,\" Scott said in a press release.  \"The approval of Charlotte's Web will ensure that children in Florida who suffer from seizures and other debilitating illnesses will have the medication needed to improve their quality of life.  I am proud to stand today with families who deserve the ability to provide their children with the best treatment available.\" \"\nThe bill decriminalizes a version of cannabis nicknamed \"Charlotte's Web\" after a Colorado child.  It is low in the chemical that gets people high when smoking the plant.\n The legislation comes as a more sweeping medical marijuana legalization question heads to Florida voters this fall.  Amendment 2 would legal all forms of medical marijuana, not just the low-buzz version authorized by the bill.  Scott and GOP lawmakers oppose the amendment, and touted the Charlotte's Web bill has a safer alternative.\n Lawmakers, along with the People United for Care organization pushing the fall amendment, offered high marks to the governor for signing the bill.\n \"While tens of thousands of Floridians are one step closer to a healthier life, many times that number can draw nothing but hope from this move,\" campaign manager Ben Pollara said in a statement.\n The lobbying effort this year was led by a cadre of parents with epileptic children, including Holley and Peyton Moseley, a Gulf Breeze couple who adopted a child RayAnn with severe epilepsy.  They have become well-known advocates for legalizing Charlotte's Web after visiting Colorado where the new medicine was developed.\n \"Florida has the opportunity to lead in the research and development of scientific breakthroughs from cannabis derived therapies,\" said Rep.  Katie Edwards, a Plantation Democrat who co-sponsored the bill.\n The bill requires five dispensing organizations throughout the state, require they hire medical directors and that staffers take training courses on the drug.  It creates a \"compassionate care registry\" where sick patients are deemed eligible by a physician.",

It will be sold through dispensaries licensed by the state Department of Health.\n Most of the Legislature's Republican leadership opposes the rival constitutional ballot initiative, as does the Florida Sheriff's Association and the Florida Medical Association.\n Many speculated that the GOP-controlled Legislature agreed to pass the low-THC proposal to squash voter interest in passing the amendment, which opponents believe will lead to the total legalization of smoking marijuana, misuse and abuse.\n Some Democrats have argued that the Republican opposition to Amendment 2 is additionally based upon a fear that voters who support the initiative are more apt to support Democratic candidates.\n United for Care, the main organization advocating in favor of Amendment 2, issued a statement praising Scott for signing SB 1030 but insisting more should be done.\n \"Today is an important day for our cause, but while tens of thousands of Floridians are one step closer to a healthier life, many times that number can draw nothing but hope from this move,\" said Ben Pollara, United for Care's campaign manager.  \"The only definitive and conclusive solution to removing the barriers faced by patients with debilitating conditions who can benefit from the use of medical cannabis is the approval of Amendment 2 on November 4.\" \"\nThe campaign is supported by Orlando lawyer John Morgan, who has spent about $4 million of his own fortune.\n The \"Vote No on 2\" campaign formed recently to give a voice to the opposition.  Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino owner and one of the wealthiest men in the world, donated $2.5 million to bankroll the anti-Amendment 2 effort.",

Rick Scott quietly signed a bill Monday legalizing a limited form of medical marijuana known as \"Charlotte's Web,\" even as much of the state's GOP leadership continues battling a constitutional amendment allowing more sweeping use of pot.\n The measure (SB 1030) allows some patients to use a strain of marijuana that is low in euphoria-inducing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but high in cannabidiol (CBD) -- a mix that supporters say provides the health-care benefits of pot without the high.\n The strain is supposed to dramatically reduce life-threatening seizures in children with a rare-form of epilepsy but has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n \"The approval of Charlotte?s Web will ensure that children in Florida who suffer from seizures and other debilitating illnesses will have the medication needed to improve their quality of life,\" said Scott, who had announced during the legislative session that he would sign the bill.  \"I am proud to stand today with families who deserve the ability to provide their children with the best treatment available.\" \"\nThe governor also signed a measure (SB 1700) shielding patient records related to the use of medical marijuana from public view.\n The charge for the legislation was led by Rep.  Matt Gaetz, a conservative Fort Walton Beach Republican who took up the cause after discussions with Holley and Peyton Moseley.  They say Charlotte's Web can help their adopted daughter, RayAnn, and children in about 150,000 other Florida families.  Gaetz is also the son of Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville.\n \"Thank you @FLGovScott for signing the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act! #helpisontheway,\" the younger Gaetz wrote in a Twitter post Monday.",

The bill is colloquially referred to as \"Charlotte's Web.\" \"\n\"The approval of Charlotte's Web will ensure that children in Florida who suffer from seizures and other debilitating illnesses will have the medication needed to improve their quality of life,\" Scott, a Republican, said in a prepared statement after signing the legislation.  The bill authorizes a low-THC, non-euphoric strain of marijuana to treat certain medical conditions like childhood epilepsy.\n Florida now joins 22 other states and the District of Columbia in legalizing medical marijuana.  The bill overwhelmingly passed both houses of the Florida Legislature, passing 111-7 in the House and 30-9 in the Senate.  Republicans hold significant majorities in each chamber.\n Later this year, Florida voters will weigh a more expansive medical marijuana measure, Amendment 2, which expands the forms of medical marijuana doctors may prescribe and increases the number of individuals who qualify for such a prescription.  Scott opposes passage of Amendment 2 and drew support from casino magnate and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who donated $2.5 million to the Drug Free Florida Committee to defeat the referendum.\n However, prominent Democrats have also voiced opposition to Amendment 2, including Rep.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.\n Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, told the Tampa Bay Times: \"I have concerns that it is written too broadly and stops short of ensuring strong regulatory oversight from state officials.\" \" She also voted against the Farr-Rohrabacher amendment last month, a measure prohibiting the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws.\n That ultraconservative Adelson and Democrat stalwart Wasserman Schultz both oppose the same amendment underscores the complicated politics of medical marijuana.  Though medical marijuana remains illegal in Republican bastions throughout the South and Midwest, some deeply conservative states like Alaska and Montana have permitted its use for more than 10 years.\n Similarly, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has only recently voiced support for medical or decriminalized marijuana in deep blue New York, where both remain illegal.\n Marijuana Majority's Tom Angell told the Huffington Post the issue transcends traditional political coalitions.  \"Polls show overwhelming voter support for medical marijuana across the board, from all parts of the political spectrum.\" \"",

The strain is high in cannabidiol, or CBD, which has been used to treat conditions such as childhood epilepsy.\n Families with children who suffer from intense seizures testified during committee hearings throughout spring's legislative session.  Among them was Renee Petro, wife of an Army colonel, who spoke about the tortured life of their 8-year-old son, Branden.\n The bill, SB 1030, was shepherded through the process by Republican state Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar, and three Republican state senators -- Rob Bradley of Fleming Island, Jeff Brandes of St. Petersburg and Aaron Bean of Fernandina Beach.\n The forceful support of a group of conservative lawmakers was seen as both a nod to the changing perception of medical marijuana and an attempt to stop a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize all medical marijuana.\n That measure, which will be \"Amendment 2\" on November's ballot, is strongly supported by attorney John Morgan, a big Democratic donor whose firm employs Charlie Crist, the likely Democratic nominee for governor.\n Morgan has put more than $3 million into his effort, which could help boost turnout for Democratic voters who would otherwise not vote.\n After the bill's passage, some supporters said they support legalizing Charlotte's Web, but not the constitutional amendment.\n \"I hope passage of the Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act shows people we've done the responsible thing and that legalizing euphoric marijuana for functionally recreational purposes would be unnecessary and undesirable,\" Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News shortly after session.\n Scott also signed a separate bill, SB 1700, which protects the identities of Charlotte's Web users.\n matt.dixon@naplesnews.com",

A close reading of SB 1030, ironically tilted the \"Compassionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014\" a/k/a the \"Charlotte's Web Bill\" reveals it sets the foundation to hand over Florida's burgeoning marijuana industry to a select few friends of the establishment class.  Charlotte's Web creates an anti-competitive platform under the guise of compassionate legislation and the Governor has stated his intent to sign it into law.\n The proposed law requires that the cultivation, processing, and dispensing of the low level-CBD end-product shall solely be conducted by a single entity referred to as a \"dispensing organization.\" \" Under the proposed law there can be no more than five dispensing organizations, statewide.  I predict there will be only one.  This anti-competitive business model is referred to as \"vertical integration.\" \" Ironically, vertical integration is exactly what the Republican majority argued against when insisting that the craft brewery industry must use a three-tier level of distribution contending that would preserve competitive markets.  This is what is known as hypocrisy.\n It gets worse.  Not only must a single entity be the sole grower, processor, manufacturer and distributor of the Charlotte's Web strain of cannabis from the time it is planted in the soil until placed under the patient's tongue as an oil, but in order to qualify as a dispensing organization the business must have been \"a registered nursery in this state for at least 30 continuous years.\" \" (See lines 185-194 from the proposed legislation inserted below.) ) I suggest this anti-competitive platform was accomplished purposefully to position a few crony capitalists (also known as democratic capitalists) to be handed the lion's share of Florida's marijuana business that will plant itself in our state following the passage of Amendment 2 to the Florida Constitution in November 2014.  I further suggest, as I have been stating in my campaign appearances around the state, this was the Republican establishment's endgame plan all along, despite political propaganda to the contrary.  A thirty-year requirement to qualify for market access is unprecedented in any industry I am aware of and certainly has no rational basis to serve as a prerequisite to grow \"weed.\" \" Shame on those in the House who introduced and supported this 11 hour amendment.  A new industry that could create prosperity for so many Floridian entrepreneurs is being funneled to a select few.\n My heart goes out to the families and patients who will be denied compassionate use because of this highly restrictive Charlotte's Web bill, which only allows for use as an oil droplet for patients who demonstrate symptoms of seizures or severe and persistent muscle spasms.  Aside from the small population this oil will help, a million Floridians will be denied the healing benefits of other derivatives of the cannabis plant which could have been made available by passage of the Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act (SB 962).  When I wrote the original Cathy Jordan Medical Cannabis Act in 2012, I purposefully included safeguards against anti-competition like we now see in 2014.  The Republican leadership refused to advance the Cathy Jordan Act again this year.  Yet they embraced this commercial market grab presently known as CS/CS/SB 1030, Enrolled.\n This is the type of politicking and cronyism that inspired me to run for Florida Attorney General.  I want to be in a position to protect the interests of ALL Floridians when the legislature has to meet its mandate to create law following the passage of Amendment 2 in November.  I do not trust any of the 'establishment candidates' to protect the will of the voters where such a huge and profitable market is involved.  On behalf of the parents who came to Tallahassee to plead for access to that which is available in 21 other states and D.C., I'm calling \"foul\" on our FL legislators.\n In the 11th hour the following was added to the bill by 7-generation Floridian, Rep.  Matt Caldwell, R-Lehigh Acres:\n185 .  .  .  An applicant for approval as a\n186 dispensing organization must be able to demonstrate:\n187 1.  The technical and technological ability to cultivate and\n188 produce low-THC cannabis.  The applicant must possess a valid\n189 certificate of registration issued by the Department of\n190 Agriculture and Consumer Services pursuant to s.  581.131 that is\n191 issued for the cultivation of more than 400,000 plants, be\n192 operated by a nurseryman as defined in s.  581.011, and have been\n193 operated as a registered nursery in this state for at least 30\n194 continuous years.\n Wohlsifer, an attorney in Tallahassee, is now running for the office held by Attorney General Pam Bondi.  Wohlsifer has announced that he will pay the qualifying fee and is certain to be on the November ballot.",

Se les preguntar\u00e1 a los votantes en noviembre que eval\u00faen la Enmienda 2, un referendo mucho m\u00e1s amplio sobre la marihuana medicinal que la legalizar\u00eda para una serie de condiciones.\n Scott dijo que \u00e9l personalmente se opone a legalizar la marihuana medicinal y colocar la iniciativa en la boleta.\n \"He visto el consumo de drogas, el alcoholismo\", dijo el lunes Scott durante una escala de campa\u00f1a.  \"He visto c\u00f3mo afecta a las familias.  No puedo apoyar eso\".\n El proyecto de ley de la Telara\u00f1a de Charlotte legaliza una cepa de marihuana que es alta en cannabidiol, o CBD, pero baja en tetrahidrocannabinol (THC), el compuesto que produce el efecto de las drogas.\n Un estimado de 125,000 ni\u00f1os en la Florida sufren de epilepsia grave y sus familias cabildearon en\u00e9rgicamente para persuadir a los legisladores reacios a abrir las puertas al uso limitado de la marihuana.  Tambi\u00e9n se podr\u00eda usar por los adultos.\n A los pacientes autorizados se les permitir\u00e1 acceso a la droga a trav\u00e9s de la forma de aceite o vapor, pero no se podr\u00e1 fumar.\n Si el 60 por ciento de los votantes de la Florida aprueba la Enmienda 2, esto podr\u00eda permitir a los m\u00e9dicos recetar otras formas de marihuana, incluyendo la que se fuma, para tratar un grupo a\u00fan m\u00e1s amplio de condiciones.\n El proyecto de ley se enmend\u00f3 a \u00faltima hora para endurecer los requerimientos de licencia para que s\u00f3lo se permita a los due\u00f1os de guarder\u00edas infantiles con negocios en operaci\u00f3n durante 30 a\u00f1os seguidos cultivar la \"Telara\u00f1a de Charlotte\".\n A los m\u00e9dicos de la Florida que se les autoriz\u00f3 ordenar esta cepa de la marihuana medicinal podr\u00e1n comenzar a escribir recetas el 1 de enero.  Se vender\u00e1 a trav\u00e9s de dispensarios que tengan la licencia del Departamento de Salud.\n La mayor\u00eda del liderazgo republicano de la legislatura se opone a la iniciativa rival de colocarlo en la boleta de votaci\u00f3n como algo constitucional, como tambi\u00e9n lo hacen la Asociaci\u00f3n de Jefes de Polic\u00eda de la Florida y la Asociaci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica de la Florida.\n Muchos especularon que la legislatura controlada por los republicanos estuvo de acuerdo en aprobar la propuesta de la marihuana con bajo THC para reducir el inter\u00e9s en aprobar la enmienda, que sus oponentes creen que llevar\u00e1 a la total legalizaci\u00f3n del uso y abuso de la marihuana que se fuma.\n Algunos dem\u00f3cratas han alegado que la oposici\u00f3n republicana a la Enmienda 2 se basa tambi\u00e9n en un temor de que los votantes que aprueben la iniciativa son m\u00e1s propensos a apoyar los candidatos dem\u00f3cratas.\n La principal organizaci\u00f3n que aboga a favor de la Enmienda 2, United for Care, emiti\u00f3 una declaraci\u00f3n que elogia a Scott por firmar la Iniciativa 1030 del Semado, pero insisti\u00f3 en que se debe hacer m\u00e1s.\n \"Hoy es un d\u00eda importante para nuestra causa, pero mientras decenas de miles de floridianos est\u00e1n a un paso m\u00e1s de una vida m\u00e1s saludable, muchas m\u00e1s veces esa cantidad pueden sacar nada m\u00e1s que esperanza de esta acci\u00f3n\", dijo Ben Pollara, director de campa\u00f1a de United for Care.  \"La \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n definitiva y concluyente para quitar las barreras que enfrentan los pacientes con condiciones debilitantes que podr\u00edan beneficiarse del uso de la marihuana medicinal es la aprobaci\u00f3n de la Enmienda 2 el 4 de noviembre\".\n La campa\u00f1a tiene el apoyo del abogado John Morgan, quien ha gastado en ella unos $4 millones de su propia fortuna.\n La campa\u00f1a \"Voten No en la 2\" se form\u00f3 recientemente para dar una voz a la oposici\u00f3n.  Sheldon Adelson, un due\u00f1o de un casino en Las Vegas y uno de los hombres m\u00e1s ricos del mundo, don\u00f3 $2.5 millones para desbaratar el esfuerzo contra la Enmienda 2.",

Est\u00e1 el uso medicinal, pero tambi\u00e9n hay cantidad de ciudadanos sanos, responsables, que en el marco de sus derechos individuales usan cannabis hoy en Chile y esa materia no est\u00e1 siendo incluida en la propuesta del Ejecutivo\", dijo Flores.\n Flores se reunir\u00e1 este lunes en la sede del Congreso en Santiago con los senadores Alejandro Guillier (Ind), Fulvio Rossi (PS) y Antonio Horvath (Ind) para expresar la necesidad del uso del cannabis como un ejercicio de libertad individual.\n A su vez, el doctor experto en pol\u00ecticas de drogas del Colegio M\u00e9dico, Sergio S\u00e1nchez, asegur\u00f3 que una cosa es debatir sobre el uso de la marihuana y otra muy distinta es especifcar de qu\u00e9 forma la sustancia estar\u00e1 al servicio de la comunidad.\n \"Nos interesa que el uso medicinal quede regulado de manera tal que est\u00e9 disponible para su uso de manera apropiada, lo que incluye el estudio de la mejor forma para acceder a la medicina.  Si vamos a tener clubes de usuarios como en Espa\u00f1a, o el Estado va a tener una plantaci\u00f3n como en Uruguay o se va a permitir el autocultivo como en Colorado, EE.UU.\", dijo S\u00e1nchez.\n El tema en la UDI adquiri\u00f3 mayor preponderancia desde que el alcalde de La Florida, Rodolfo Carter, anunciara su plan de cultivar cannabis para uso medicinal de pacientes de su comuna.\n A esto se agreg\u00f3 el diputado gremialista Felipe de Mussy, quien reconoci\u00f3 fumar marihuana de vez en cuando.\n Tras esto, el secretario general del gremialismo e integrante de la Comisi\u00f3n de Salud de la C\u00e1mara de Diputados, Javier Macaya, se mostr\u00f3 abierto a discutir el tema, aunque no para despenalizar la sustancia, sino que para determinar bien los l\u00edmites entre consumo y tr\u00e1fico.\n \"Tenemos medicamentos en Chile que tienen principios activos de drogas much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s complejos que la marihuana.  Me parece que son temas que se ridiculizan, porque legalizar la marihuana, desde la perspectiva de comercio, no est\u00e1 en los planes de la UDI.  S\u00ed nos interesa entregar la mayor cantidad de criterios objetivos a los tribunales de Justicia al momento de fallar en las causas de narcotr\u00e1fico versus de lo que son situaciones de tenencia para consumo\", dijo Macaya.\n Se espera que el pr\u00f3ximo 16 de junio el diputado Macaya discuta el tema en el comit\u00e9 pol\u00edtico de la UDI.",

Todas se revisar\u00e1n.\n \"No podemos permitir que, bajo la apariencia de entidades, amenacen el bienestar de las personas\", seg\u00fan Forn, que asegura que el Gobierno municipal tendr\u00e1 especialmente en cuenta las condiciones de seguridad y las implicaciones sanitarias, por lo que contar\u00e1 con el sector m\u00e9dico y farmacol\u00f3gico para elaborar la regulaci\u00f3n.\n Considera que es una decisi\u00f3n preventiva y sensata, y garantiza que no dejar\u00e1n \"ning\u00fan tipo de brecha o de vac\u00edo legal\" que permita a estas entidades no adaptarse a la futura regulaci\u00f3n.\n Forn ha resaltado que el Gobierno municipal tiene la responsabilidad de prevenir los efectos de las drogas --tanto duras como blandas-- sobre la sociedad, y especialmente en los j\u00f3venes, ya que pueden ser causa de fracaso escolar.\n En referencia al turismo, ha resaltado que no pueden permitir \"que Barcelona se convierta en una ciudad referente de consumo de cannabis\", raz\u00f3n que se suma a los elementos por los que ha considerado necesaria la regulaci\u00f3n.\n Para elaborar la nueva regulaci\u00f3n consultar\u00e1 a expertos del \u00e1mbito m\u00e9dico y farmacol\u00f3gico para incorporar las recomendaciones del sector.\n El primer teniente de alcalde ha hecho este anuncio en una comparencia en la que tambi\u00e9n han participado el gerente de Prevenci\u00f3n, Joan Delort y el director del \u00e1rea de R\u00e9gimen Jur\u00eddico, Manuel Mallo.  Como avanz\u00f3 EL PERI\u00d3DICO en febrero, el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona ha decidido tener listo un protocolo para ordenar estas entidades ante la inacci\u00f3n de la Generalitat, que no decide si regula o proh\u00edbe los clubs cann\u00e1bicos debido a las divergencias entre las 'conselleries' de Interior y Salut.\n Esta regulaci\u00f3n se trabaja en un momento en el que los clubs cann\u00e1bicos con \u00e1nimo de lucro est\u00e1n proliferando.  El limbo legal que permite a las asociaciones dispensar marihuana y productos derivados en sus sedes sociales exige el cumplimiento de una lista de buenas pr\u00e1cticas, una especie de c\u00f3digo de conducta autoimpuesto que garantiza la permanencia en los cauces de ese vac\u00edo -los hay- y el mantenimiento de la distancia con lo ilegal, pero algunas asociaciones no juegan limpio.\n Sin ir m\u00e1s lejos, la pasada semana los Mossos cerraron por primera vez en Catalunya una asociaci\u00f3n cann\u00e1bica en cumplimiento de una orden judicial.  El proceso de cierre del club, ubicado en el distrito de Ciutat Vella de Barcelona, se inici\u00f3 el 23 de mayo, cuando la polic\u00eda, a instancias de la Fiscal\u00eda de Barcelona, denunci\u00f3 que en el local se traficaba con drogas y se favorec\u00eda y promocionaba su consumo.",
