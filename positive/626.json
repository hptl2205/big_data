The film will also feature Jai Courtney and Cara Delevingne.\n\n\"Suicide Squad\" is based on a DC Comic and centers on a group of supervillains who are tasked by the government to go on a mission that will offer them redemption but will likely kill them all.\n\nLeto will play the Joker, Smith will play Batman villain Deadshot, Hardy will play Rick Flagg, and Robbie will play Harley Quinn. Courtney has been cast as Boomerang and British model Delevingne has been cast as Enchantress, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nJesse Eisenberg was rumored to star in the project, but he's not part of the official casting. David Ayer is directing, and Charles Roven is producing. \"Suicide Squad\" will not relate to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, which featured Heath Ledger as The Joker.\n\nGreg Silverman, president, creative development and worldwide production stated: \"The Warner Bros. roots are deep on this one. David Ayer returns to the studio where he wrote Training Day and brings his incredible ability to craft multidimensional villains to this iconic DC property with a cast of longtime Warner collaborators Will Smith and Tom Hardy, and other new and returning favorites: Margot, Jared, Jai and Cara. We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under Ayer's amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero.\"",

I guess the rumors were true.\n\nGreg Silverman, president of Warner Bros. Pictures, announced yesterday the official cast of Suicide Squad, the David Ayer (End of Watch, Fury) written and directed DC Comics adaptation. Will Smith will be Deadshot, Tom Hardy takes the role of Rick Flagg (the leader of the squad), Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street) is Harley Quinn, Jared Leto becomes the Joker (oh yeah), Jai Courtney (Divergent) will play Boomerang and Cara Delevingne (Pan) is set for the Enchantress.\n\nHaving Will Smith part of this is pretty cool, not gonna lie, but the real stars will definitely be Margot Robbie and Jared Leto as Harley Quinn and the Joker. Both definitely have their work cut out for them as taking those roles is no small task, especially in the case of the Joker. Either way I'm a lot more excited now for Suicide Squad than I was a few months ago, when Warner announced the project.\n\nSuicide Squad aims for an August 5th 2016 release, will you be there? I'll need a trailer in both cases but right now I'd say I'm looking forward more to this than Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.",

Jared Leto is the Joker, Will Smith is Deadshot, Tom Hardy is Rick Flagg, Margot Robbie is Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney is Boomerang and Cara Delevinge is Enchantress. The film is scheduled for release August 5, 2016. Read more about the Suicide Squad cast below.\n\nVariety posted the news. Here's what WB President Greg Silverman said about the cast:\n\nThe Warner Bros. roots are deep on this one. We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under David Ayer's amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero.\n\nWhile the confirmation of this news is incredibly huge, it's all stuff we'd heard rumors about over the past few weeks. The fact that Courtney is playing Boomerang and Delevinge (who was previously thought to be up for Harley Quinn) is Enchantress, are the two newest bits.\n\nWarner Bros. sees this film as their superhero version of Ocean's Eleven and did their best to fill it with a cast somewhat similar to that film. I think they achieved that. Smith remains one of the biggest stars in the world. He's an actor that rarely, if ever, does ensemble films anymore. This is Leto's first film after winning an Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club. Then there are Robbie, Hardy and Courtney, all of whom are getting to be stars on their own. This is massive.\n\nAnd can we just step back and think about this? Will Smith is playing freaking Deadshot! Jared Leto is following in the footsteps of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger to play the most iconic villain in all of comic books. And he'll surely have to go against Batman at some point. Plus, we finally get Harley Quinn on the big screen. My mind is a little boggled right now.\n\nSuicide Squad will start shooting in April in Toronto.\n\nAre you surprised as the massive level of talent in the film?",

The confirmation of the line-up for Suicide Squad, made by Warner Bros today, comes after months of speculation. The movie, which brings together some of the best known villains from DC Comics, is the antithesis of the hit film Avengers Assemble, by Disney-owned rival Marvel Studios.\n\nIn contrast to the superheroes who make up the Avengers, Suicide Squad is based on the exploits of a team of supervillains who are recruited to take on suicidal black-ops missions for the US Government in exchange for shorter prison sentences. Jared Leto will play the Joker - in one of his first roles since winning the best supporting actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club - and will be the first actor since the late Heath Ledger to play the character. Will Smith will star as hired assassin Deadshot, while Tom Hardy will play military expert Rick Flagg. Margot Robbie has been cast as Harley Quinn, an ally of the Joker, while model Cara Delevingne, in her biggest acting role to date, will portray magical villain Enchantress. And Australian actor Jai Courtney will play Boomerang, an enemy of comic book superhero the Flash.\n\nJesse Eisenberg - Lex Luthor in the forthcoming Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - is understood to be in talks about joining the cast. And US chat show host Oprah Winfrey, along with Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, is in the running to play the team's boss, Amanda Waller. Directed by David Ayer, shooting begins in Toronto next April, while the film is slated for release next August.\n\n\"The Warner Bros roots are deep on this one, David Ayer returns to the studio where he wrote Training Day and brings his incredible ability to craft multidimensional villains to this iconic DC property with a cast of longtime Warner collaborators Will Smith and Tom Hardy, and other new and returning favorites: Margot, Jared, Jai and Cara,\" said studio president Greg Silverman in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under Ayer's amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero,\" he added.\n\nThis week's announcement is part of an ongoing battle for box office supremacy between Warner Bros, which owns the film rights to DC Comics, and Disney, which owns Marvel Studios. It is one of more than 20 superhero films announced by the rival studios in recent weeks. Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Black Panther and Doctor Strange are among a slew of comic book characters featuring in movies scheduled for release by the end of this decade. Others include new Superman and Batman films, as well as movies based on superheroes like The Flash, and Aquaman.\n\nAnd other actors are choosing to take on the roles of supervillains, with Dwayne Johnson to star as Black Adam, the villain in Shazam - another DC Comics adaptation being made into a film.",

                    "body": "Meet your new Joker. And, while you're about it, your new Deadshot, Rick Flag, Boomerang, Harley Quinn and Enchantress. After a few weeks of speculation and deal making, Jared Leto, Will Smith, Tom Hardy, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and Cara Delevigne have all officially signed on to star in David Ayer's take on the DC villains tweam-up Suicide Squad.\n\nWith a script by Justin Marks, the film will see an assembly of baddies and anti-heroes brought together by a secretive government group and offered the chance for redemption if they'll go on a mission. There's just one tiny drawback: they might not survive it.\n\nThe Joker, of course, needs little introduction, though it'll be odd to see him introduced without his natural nemesis, Batman. Assuming Warner Bros. doesn't have plans to stealthily introduce him in Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice via some extra shooting, of course - after all, the film still doesn't arrive until early 2016.\n\nSmith's Deadshot, meanwhile - who Courtney had been rumoured for - is really Floyd Lawton, a hired assassin who claims he never misses. Rick Flag (Hardy) is the son of a legendary military man called upon to lead the squad despite some seriously unstable tendencies. Robbie has taken the role of Harley Quinn, who might be familiar to Batman fans as the Joker's female sidekick, but who has her own agenda. Courtney, meanwhile, will be Boomerang, whose skill you can probably figure out. Seen as something of a class clown by the others, he's also been known for racism, though we doubt that will be covered in the film. Finally, there's Delevigne as Enchantress, a woman who uses her magical gifts for villainous ends.\n\nThere have been reports that Jesse Eisenberg is in talks to show up as Lex Luthor, but there's no word on whether he's actually made a deal. And Warners is still looking for someone to play Amanda Waller, who oversees the team, with the likes of Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and even Oprah Winfrey under consideration. \"The Warner Bros. roots are deep on this one,\" Warner Bros. president Greg Silverman says in a statement picked up by Variety. \"We look forward to seeing this terrific ensemble, under David Ayer's amazing guidance, give new meaning to what it means to be a villain and what it means to be a hero.\" Ayer will kick off shooting this coming April in Toronto, aiming for an August 5, 2016 release date.",

Podr\u00eda ser atrevido decir que una cinta le ha revivido su carrera. Pero lo cierto es que algo as\u00ed ha ocurrido: Leto no parec\u00eda muy interesado en seguir actuando despu\u00e9s del fiasco que signific\u00f3 \"Alexander\" y, m\u00e1s bien estaba concentrado en su carrera musical que iba viento en popa gracias a \"30 Seconds to Mars\".\n\nAhora, el actor se encuentra ante un reto bastante grande, sobre todo para los fan\u00e1ticos del mundo de los superh\u00e9roes: darle vida al Joker en \"Suicide Squad\", la cinta que juntar\u00e1 a todos los villanos del mundo de DC Comics. S\u00ed, Jared Leto se pondr\u00e1 en los zapatos que dej\u00f3 Heath Ledger.\n\nLa carrera de Jared Leto antes de \"Dallas Buyers Club\" no ha sido una particularmente relevante. Por ah\u00ed, el esp\u00edritu noventero nost\u00e1lgico se puede despertar con \"Leyenda urbana\", una de las tantas cintas que derivaron del fen\u00f3meno \"Scream\". Tambi\u00e9n podemos contar sus trabajos con Terrence Malick (\"La delgada l\u00ednea roja\") o James Toback (\"Black and White\") como sus cintas m\u00e1s atractivas.\n\nY, claro, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 \"R\u00e9quiem por un sue\u00f1o\", aquella cinta sobre la drogadicci\u00f3n que le dio una fama importante a Darren Aronofsky, encumbr\u00e1ndolo como uno de los m\u00e1s importantes cineastas de su generaci\u00f3n. Lo cierto es que pocas cintas han envejecido tan mal: no solo porque su est\u00e9tica efectista ya no tiene nada de novedosa, sino que a eso hay que sumarle una dosis de pretensi\u00f3n y discurso moral que resulta redundante.\n\nAhora, Jared Leto tiene el reto de meterse en la piel de un personaje que hace maldad a partir de la iron\u00eda y del humor. Un reto interesante, sin duda. A esperar la cinta, a estrenarse el 2016, para saber si la apuesta funciona.",
