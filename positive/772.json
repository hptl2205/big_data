                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Auto safety regulators, for the second time late Tuesday, expanded their warning to owners of vehicles recalled for defective Takata airbags, urging them to get the airbags replaced.\n\nBut the federal website created to help consumers to verify whether their vehicle has been recalled was unavailable for most of the day, and was still down as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAfter initially directing consumers to keep checking that website in its first alert to consumers on Monday, the National Highway Safety Traffic Administration is now instructing customers to visit vehicle manufacturer websites to verify whether their car has been recalled.\n\nMeanwhile, The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported today that federal prosecutors led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York are investigating Takata's handling of the defective airbags.\n\nThe newspaper said the probe is at a \"preliminary stage,\" and that prosecutors don't want to down the recall efforts. There was no immediate comment from Takata on the report.\n\nThe Takata probe is patterned after another investigation by the Manhattan U.S. attorney that eventually led Toyota in March to pay $1.2 billion to settle fraud charges that stemmed from its unintended acceleration recall crisis, the newspaper said, citing one person briefed on the matter.\n\nThe latest alert from NHTSA said as many as 7.8 million U.S. vehicles are affected by the recalls for potentially defective Takata Corp. airbags that could spray shrapnel at occupants after a crash. That's up 28 percent from the 6.1 million announced hours earlier. NHTSA said the new number corrected the vehicle list provided in prior safety bulletins this week, adding some vehicles and excluding others from previous bulletins.\n\nNHTSA has urged owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles to replace installed air bags as soon as possible.\n\nIn the expanded bulletin, Honda accounts for almost 5.1 million of the vehicles, Toyota 877,000 vehicles, Nissan almost 695,000 vehicles, BMW nearly 628,000 vehicles and Chrysler more than 371,000 vehicles.\n\nNHTSA is focusing its most urgent warnings on owners affected by regional recalls of vehicles sold or registered in areas of Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Louisiana near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii.\n\n\"Responding to these recalls, whether old or new, is essential to personal safety and it will help aid our ongoing investigation into Takata airbags and what appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperatures,\" David Friedman, NHTSA deputy administrator, said in statement.\n\n\"However, we're leaving no stone unturned in our aggressive pursuit to track down the full geographic scope of this issue.\"\n\nThe U.S. safety agency is investigating whether Takata airbag inflators made between 2000 and 2007 were improperly sealed. Bags inflating with too much force could potentially spray metal shrapnel at occupants. They have been linked to four deaths and resulted in several lawsuits.\n\nThe probe has focused on inflators recovered from cars being recalled for repairs in hot and humid places like Florida. Takata is cooperating with that investigation along with 10 automakers.\n\nMore than 16 million vehicles globally have been recalled because of defective Takata air bags since 2008.\n\nGM said Tuesday it plans to warn owners of 2003-04 Pontiac Vibe hatchbacks in warm-weather areas not to allow front-seat passengers until defective air bags are replaced.\n\nThe overnight letters will go out \"as soon as possible\" and the Vibe owner group may grow, GM spokesman Alan Adler said. GM and Toyota jointly built the Vibe at a factory in California that's now owned by Tesla Motors Inc.\n\n\"We are treating this urgently,\" Adler said.\n\nOf the 85,000 people who own these cars, those living in high-humidity areas, including South Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Guam, will receive the letters. GM doesn't yet have a precise tally of owners in those climates, Adler said.\n\nIn its statement Tuesday, NHTSA also encouraged owners of the 2005 Pontiac Vibe and 2005 Saab 9-2X to have their vehicles checked and recalled if necessary.\n\nThe agency encouraged owners to periodically monitor the agency's online database, using a vehicle identification number, to determine whether a model is subject to recall because automakers continue to add vehicles to the recall list.\n\nTakata cooperating\n\nTakata said it would cooperate fully with U.S. authorities and automakers after NHTSA issued the latest advisory.\n\n\"We take (the NHTSA's) latest action seriously,\" Takata said in a statement.\n\nTakata said the cost of repairs for the 4.74 million vehicles subject to NHTSA's bulletin on Monday had already been set aside, and that any additional costs would be minimal.\n\nThe deepening crisis involving deadly airbags is shaking confidence in the ability of automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. to ensure the safety of millions of U.S. drivers.\n\nToyota is advising U.S. owners to keep passengers out of front seats until defective Takata airbag parts are replaced, four months after following the same procedure in Japan.\n\nTakata faces investigations into whether exploding shrapnel from its flawed parts are to blame for at least four deaths involving vehicles made by Honda, including a Florida crash that was initially investigated as a homicide because of deep gashes to the victim's neck.\n\nThe growing number of airbag recalls also raise doubts about whether carmakers have learned to address defects quickly and comprehensively after GM's bungled ignition switch recalls and Toyota's failures in 2009 and 2010 involving unintended acceleration. Honda is under separate probes over whether it underreported fatalities and injuries in the U.S.\n\n\"This undermines the credibility or confidence in driving, generally, and in cars,\" Ashvin Chotai, managing director of researcher Intelligence Automotive Asia, said by phone. \"There's very little consumers can do about it. Of course they feel less confident about sitting in a car and they'll be extra cautious, but beyond that, what can you do?\"\n\nThe recalls of at least 4.7 million vehicles in the U.S. during the last two years tied to Takata airbags also involves Nissan Motor Corp., Mazda Motor Corp., and BMW.\n\nHonda, Nissan and Mazda have yet to follow Toyota in issuing warnings against sitting in front-passenger seats, a step that the Japanese carmakers took in their domestic market in June.\n\nCongressional query\n\nThe U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Tuesday it was seeking information about Takata's airbag defects from the NHTSA and automakers.\n\nThe U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee asked federal safety regulators to provide a briefing on its investigation into the airbags manufactured by Takata, a House committee aide said on Tuesday.\n\nThe aide also said that committee staffers plan to meet with auto manufacturers \"to discuss supplier issues.\" The committee wants to hear directly from NHTSA about its probe into Takata, the aide added.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., where some of the airbag incidents have occurred, wrote to NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman urging the agency to further expand the recalls.\n\n\"NHTSA should ensure that owners of cars that are not registered in Florida, but spend a substantial portion of the year operating in the state of Florida are covered by the recall,\" Nelson wrote.\n\nHe was referring to \"snowbirds,\" people who spend winters in Florida to escape the cold in the northern part of the United States.\n\nIn his letter to Friedman, Nelson also said automakers with defective airbags should offer loaner cars or rental car reimbursements for consumers unable to get their cars fixed quickly.\n\nImproper performance\n\nToyota extended a warning to include the U.S. after Takata shared data that showed the inflators sent back to the supplier as part of its customers' recalls were performing improperly. The world's largest automaker this week called back 247,000 vehicles, including some models of the Toyota Corolla, Matrix, Sequoia and Tundra, made from 2001 to 2004.\n\nMost of the vehicles were subject to recalls by Toyota in June this year or May 2013, said John Hanson, a U.S. spokesman for the company.\n\n\"We're prepared to do whatever the owner asks us to do,\" he said. \"If the owner is afraid to drive the car, we'll come and get it.\"\n\nToyota began issuing the public warning against sitting in front-passenger seats of unfixed cars as NHTSA stepped up efforts to reach affected vehicle owners.\n\n'Act immediately'\n\nNHTSA issued a statement Monday telling owners to \"act immediately on recall notices to replace defective Takata airbags,\" adding there should be particular urgency in areas of high humidity such as Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\nHonda is still examining airbag inflators that have been replaced as part of its recalls of 2.8 million vehicles in the U.S. tied to Takata airbags the past two years, spokesman Chris Martin said.\n\n\"We will act appropriately based on the results of this investigation,\" Martin said by phone. Honda is Takata's biggest customer and has called back 6 million vehicles for problems with airbags in nine recalls since 2008. The carmaker owns 1.2 percent of Tokyo-based Takata.\n\nNissan doesn't plan to disable passenger-side airbags in the U.S. and hasn't received instructions from NHTSA to do so, said spokesman Chris Keeffe. Mazda also doesn't plan to change its U.S. recall strategy, spokeswoman Keiko Yano said by phone.\n\nMotorists wondering whether their cars are subject to a recall can type their vehicle identification numbers into the government's website, www.safercar.gov. The search function on the site was not working for much of the day and evening Tuesday.\n\nAutomaker response\n\nWhile Takata is at the center of the U.S. government's airbag investigation, NHTSA also is probing how the car companies responded to defects with the components.\n\nThe Center for Auto Safety, a watchdog group in the U.S., accused Honda last week of failing to report all airbag-related injuries and a deaths to a government database as required. The center's Oct. 15 letter to David Friedman, NHTSA's deputy administrator, also called for the U.S. Justice Department to conduct a criminal investigation into Honda's reporting.\n\nHonda asked a third party to begin an audit last month of potential inaccuracies in the quarterly Early Warning Reports it's required to file to NHTSA. The automaker said in an Oct. 16 statement that it will share results of the audit with the regulator soon.\n\nThe Florida Highway Patrol said last week it's investigating a fatality involving a Honda Accord driver stemming from neck wounds allegedly caused by an inflating airbag.\n\nThere are at least two similar incidents involving Honda vehicles. Honda said Oct. 16 it's also examining whether a faulty airbag was to blame for the death of a man who crashed his Acura sedan in a California parking lot.\n\nRyan Beene, Reuters and Bloomberg contributed to this report.\n\nOwners of the following vehicles are being urged to act immediately on recalls involving potentially defective airbags made by Takata, according to a corrected list distributed late Tuesday by NHTSA.\n\nEditor's note: This list has been revised to remove an inaccurate listing of Nissan vehicles.",

The agency says it is urging consumers to immediately address recall notices to replace the Takata airbags equipped on their vehicles because they are defective.\n\nU.S. geographic areas of special concern for these vehicles include Hawaii because the islands' high humidity can make a dangerous airbag rupture more likely. The airbags have metal components called inflators that can break apart when the bags go off in a crash, sending shrapnel into the passenger compartment that can injure or kill, according to NHTSA. The agency is looking at airbags industrywide that fail or deploy with too much force and have been potentially linked to four deaths.\n\nToyota added more vehicles into its recent airbag recalls and has advised American owners of the affected cars to seat passengers in the back until the recall repairs are completed, according to news reports. Many of the cars from the other manufacturers have already been recalled but many of them have not been repaired.\n\n\"The NHTSA list now covers 7.8 million affected U.S. vehicles, with certain models from 2000 to 2008 noted by their urgent consumer advisory,\" said the Automobile Club of Southern California Automotive Research Center Chief Automotive Engineer Steve Mazor, which also provides technical expertise to AAA Hawaii. \"If there's a safety recall of your vehicle, contact your local dealer and have the repair completed as soon as possible. You should also keep a copy of the work for your repair records.\"\n\nIf drivers are unsure whether their vehicle is impacted by the Takata recalls or any other vehicle recalls, they can visit www.safercar.gov/vinlookup. On this website, consumers can search by their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the unique federally-registered number of their car or truck, to determine if their vehicle has a recall that needs to be addressed. In addition, through this link, drivers can sign up for NHTSA recall alerts.\n\nThe recall alerts are distributed before recall letters, which have distinctive labeling, and are mailed to affected consumers.\n\nThe new recall label letters say \"Important Safety Recall Information\" in red and black, along with the phrase \"Issued in Accordance with Federal Law,\" and U.S. Dept. of Transportation and NHTSA logos, said Mazor.\n\n7.8 Million Affected U.S. Vehicles, by Manufacturer, Impacted by CY 2013 and 2014 Recalls Involving Takata Airbags\n\nNote: Numbers cited for potentially affected vehicles below are subject to change, says NHTSA, as manufacturers continue to add VINs to the database.",

That's in part because extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperature may be a factor in the airbag problem.\n\n\"Responding to these recalls, whether old or new, is essential to personal safety and it will help aid our ongoing investigation into Takata airbags and what appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperatures. However, we're leaving no stone unturned in our aggressive pursuit to track down the full geographic scope of this issue,\" said NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman in a press release announcing the additional vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, NHTSA announced that roughly 4.7 million vehicles could be affected by the recall.\n\nCar owners should check their manufacturer's website for recall information. They will need their vehicle identification number (VIN) in order to determine whether their car is included. A Web site maintained by the NHTSA -- Safercar.gov -- has not been functioning because of overwhelming demand.\n\nBelow is an updated list of vehicles that may be affected by the recall.",

The agency urged people to use its website to see if their cars are affected - but a feature allowing people to check for recalls by vehicle identification number malfunctioned Monday night and still wasn't operational Wednesday.\"\n\nMichigan Radio's Tracy Samilton told our Newscast Unit that the bags in the recalled cars may have \"faulty inflators that can rupture and send metal fragments flying out.\" Samilton says at least four people have died in accidents related to the airbag problem. Officials believe prolonged exposure to high heat and humidity might be a cause for the defect. That's led the NHTSA to give special warning to vehicle owners in warm, humid climates.\n\n\"The message comes with urgency, especially for owners of vehicles affected by regional recalls in the following areas: Florida, Puerto Rico, limited areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii.\"\n\nToyota was one of the automakers with vehicles added to the expanded list. But Reuters reports the automaker says it will stand by Takata, the company that produces the faulty airbags:\n\n\"...a top Toyota Motor Corp executive said in Tokyo that the Japanese automaker had no plans to abandon Takata despite the supplier's struggles.\n\n\"Toyota's not one to just dump a supplier,\" Steve St. Angelo, Toyota's head of Latin American operations and the former chief quality officer in North America, told reporters. \"Have we ever eliminated a supplier? Yes. But it's really, really tough. We will exhaust every opportunity to help that supplier first.\"\"\n\nDavid Shepardson, the Washington Bureau Chief of the Detroit News, told NPR's David Greene that in some places, Toyota is shifting replacement airbags away from colder states, to warm weather states. Shepardson also said Toyota is telling some vehicle owners that they will deactivate their passenger airbags until they can be replaced.\n\nToyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have vehicles being recalled.

According to TIME magazine, the faulty air bags have been linked to at least three deaths and over 100 injuries.\n\nIn a NHTSA press release, NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman said \"Responding to these recalls, whether old or new, is essential to personal safety and it will help aid our ongoing investigation into Takata airbags and what appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperatures,\"\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the air bags contain a defective, unstable propellant that can explode even in a minor accident. This can send metal shards flying into the cabin, leading to serious injury or death.\n\nNHTSA stated that the alert \"comes with urgency\", especially for car owners located in Florida, Puerto Rico, limited areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii.\n\nNYT reports that after the regulators alerted consumers to the issue, many were left without clear direction.

Individuals who tried to call the agency's hotline (1-888-327-4236) were frequently put on hold. Furthermore, car owners were not able to actually replace the defective parts because they were not available.\n\nThe agency said in a statement \"N.H.T.S.A. is experiencing intermittent network issues that are making some functions on SaferCar.gov temporarily unavailable,\" according to NYT, also added \"We apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to try back later.\"",

October 21, 2004; The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urges owners of certain Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors vehicles to act immediately on recall notices to replace defective Takata airbags. Over seven million vehicles are involved in these recalls, which have occurred as far back as 18 months ago and as recently as Monday. The message comes with urgency, especially for owners of vehicles affected by regional recalls in the following areas: Florida, Puerto Rico, limited areas near the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, as well as Guam, Saipan, American Samoa, Virgin Islands and Hawaii.\n\n\"Responding to these recalls, whether old or new, is essential to personal safety and it will help aid our ongoing investigation into Takata airbags and what appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperatures.

Once owner recall notices are available, owners can retrieve a copy from SaferCar.gov, or will receive one by U.S. mail and are advised to carefully follow the enclosed instructions.\n\nConsumers will be able to tell whether their vehicle or a used vehicle they are considering is at risk due to an uncompleted recall\n\nWASHINGTON October 20, 2014; Every year, millions of vehicles are recalled in the United States due to safety defects or noncompliance with federal safety standards. To help car buyers, owners and renters know that their vehicles are safe and their safety defects have been address, the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) today unveiled a new, free, online search tool consumers can use to find out if a vehicle is directly impacted by a recall.\n\nThe new tool is available from the top of this page as well as on www.safercar.gov/vinlookup and provides consumers with a quick and easy way to identify uncompleted recalls by entering their Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). All major light vehicle and motorcycle brands can be searched.\n\n\"Safety is our highest priority, and an informed consumer is one of our strongest allies in ensuring recalled vehicles are repaired,\" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. \"Starting today car owners, shoppers, and renters can find out if a specific vehicle has a safety defect that needs to be fixed - using our free online tool.\"\n\nAlso effective today, under the new NHTSA mandate, all major light vehicle and motorcycle manufacturers are required to provide VIN search capability for uncompleted recalls on their own websites. This data must be updated at least weekly. NHTSA's new VIN look-up tool directly relies on information from all major automakers, and regularly updated information from the automakers is critical to the efficacy of the search tool.\n\nConsumers can find their vehicle identification number by looking at the dashboard on the driver's side of the vehicle, or on the driver's side door on the door post where the door latches when it is closed.\n\nDetermining whether there is a recall that consumers need to take action on is easy. After entering the VIN number into the field, results will appear if the consumer has an open recall on their vehicle, and if there are none, owners will see \"No Open Recalls.\"\n\n\"Just as every single automaker should never hesitate to recall a defective vehicle, consumers should never hesitate to get their recalled vehicle fixed,\" said NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman. \"By making individual VIN searches readily available, we're providing another service to consumers - the peace of mind knowing that the vehicle they own, or that they are thinking of buying or renting, is free of safety defects.\"\n\nToday's announcement builds on NHTSA's current efforts to provide consumers with information to help them make informed decisions, including the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 5-Star Ratings System, Recall envelope and Safercar mobile apps which provide on-the-spot information on crash protection features, advanced safety features, and recalls on new vehicles and many older models. In addition, NHTSA is working with the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) to help ensure that franchise dealerships across the United States become aware of and understand how to use the new VIN search tool.",

It did not include the full universe of affected vehicles, and incorrectly included certain vehicles. As a result the population numbers changed.\n\n6. Will the vehicle population numbers continue to change?\n\nThe population numbers are subject to change at any time for a number of reasons. When a manufacturer announces a recall, they provide NHTSA with the potential number of affected vehicles. And as new data emerges, new vehicles could be identified and added to the recall.\n\n7. What is the difference between the 2013 and 2014 recalls involving Takata air bags?\n\nBoth recalls address a vehicle defect related to the inflators in Takata airbags. The 2013 recalls involve vehicles nationwide. The 2014 recalls involve vehicles that have been exposed to consistently high temperatures and humidity. NHTSA is investigating the full geographic scope of this defect and will require the manufacturers to expand as necessary.\n\n8. There have been news reports with conflicting information on the vehicle makes and models affected by the recall, as well as the population numbers. Why is that?\n\nNHTSA's October 20 advisory, provided to national media, was incorrect. It did not include the full universe of affected vehicles, and incorrectly included certain vehicles. NHTSA issued an updated advisory on October 22 to correct the record. The current advisory is a comprehensive list of vehicles recalled to date under the 2013 and 2014 calendar year recalls involving Takata air bags.\n\nConsumers that are uncertain whether their vehicle is impacted by the Takata recalls, or any other recall, can check by their vehicle identification number (VIN) here: http://www.safercar.gov/vinlookup . This site currently contains an effective workaround to the website problem that gets people the safety information they need now while we work to fix our system.\n\nOwners that have been contacted by their manufacturer should contact their dealer's service department and make arrangements for the repair. In addition, consumers can sign up for NHTSA recall alerts, which go out before recall letters are mailed by the manufacturers to the affected owners.",

The big problem Tuesday night, there's a lot of confusion over what you need to do.\n\nThis recall involves ten automakers and affects more than six million vehicles, according to NHTSA.\n\nIn recall situations the NHTSA urges motorists to go to www.safecar.gov to find out if your car is being recalled, but that is temporarily down and so is the app.\n\nClay Ingram with AAA Alabama says this is the largest recall he can remember. \"The estimate out there right now is one in five vehicles on the road have been recalled right now, which is just mind boggling,\" said Ingram.\n\nSome automobile owners received letters in the mail notifying them of the air bag recall, but Ingram says if you have a used car you may not get a letter. \"Sometimes those notices have a hard time finding you,\" said Ingram.\n\nIngram says this is not something you want to put off, if your car is on the recall list. \"I would try not to drive it honestly if at all possible. Some people won't have any choice but a minimum get it repaired and get it addressed as quickly as possible because some people have been killed by this shrapnel,\" said Ingram.\n\nThe NHTSA says people can contact their manufacturer to find if their vehicle is being recalled.\n\nTakata, the company who makes the airbags issued a statement back in June.\n\n\"Takata is committed to the highest standards of safety for our customers- and their customers,\" said Mr. Takada, Chairman and CEO. \"For the past several months, we have been consistently cooperating with NHTSA, and we will continue to do so during the defect investigation that the agency recently opened, but we also stand by the quality of our products. Takata is committed to ensuring the safety and functionality of its airbag inflators, and we strive to avoid any malfunction. Each of the six incidents that prompted the NHTSA investigation occurred in Puerto Rico or Florida. We currently believe the high levels of humidity in those states are important factors; and as a result our engineers are analyzing the impact that humidity may have on the potential for an inflator malfunction, as well as other possible contributing factors.\"\n\nClick here for a list of the potentially affected vehicles from the NHTSA.",

Pero los fabricantes han limitado las advertencias a zonas de alta humedad y excluido autos y camiones en los estados norte\u00c3\u00b1os. La NHTSA dijo que los propietarios en Florida, Puerto Rico, Guam, Saip\u00c3\u00a1n, Samoa Americana, Islas V\u00c3\u00adrgenes Estadounidenses, Hawai y \"zonas limitadas cerca del Golfo de M\u00c3\u00a9xico en Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia y Louisiana\" deben prestar atenci\u00c3\u00b3n especial al problema.\n\nLa agencia reguladora ha corregido dos veces el n\u00c3\u00bamero de veh\u00c3\u00adculos afectados y ha reconocido que su primera lista, difundida el lunes, inclu\u00c3\u00ada autos no equipados con las bolsas Takata a la vez que omitido otros que s\u00c3\u00ad las tienen. La agencia exhort\u00c3\u00b3 a la gente a entrar en su p\u00c3\u00a1gina de internet para saber si sus autos est\u00c3\u00a1n afectados, pero el elemento que permit\u00c3\u00ada verificar los retiros por el n\u00c3\u00bamero de identificaci\u00c3\u00b3n del veh\u00c3\u00adculo no funcionaba el martes ni el mi\u00c3\u00a9rcoles por la ma\u00c3\u00b1ana.\n\nDesde hace a\u00c3\u00b1os los fabricantes retiran autos para reparar el problema, pero ni Tanaka ni la NHTSA han podido identificar la causa. La agencia inici\u00c3\u00b3 una investigaci\u00c3\u00b3n en junio y sus documentos indican que los productos qu\u00c3\u00admicos utilizados para inflar las bolsas pueden ser alterados por la humedad elevada, lo que las hace explotar con fuerza excesiva en el momento de inflarse.",

Funcionarios de Audi dijeron que el problema no est\u00e1 asociado con los defectos de las bolsas de aire reportados por Takata Corp. que han sido ampliamente reportados en los medios y han afectado a al menos 12 millones de veh\u00edculos en todo el mundo, agregando que la instalaci\u00f3n de la actualizaci\u00f3n de software que soluciona el problema \"es una cuesti\u00f3n de tres minutos\". La empresa investiga accidentes que puedan estar relacionados con el problema.\n\nLa medida tomada por Audi es la preocupaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s reciente de una industria agobiada por los llamados a reparaci\u00f3n. Millones de autos han sido llamados a revisi\u00f3n en 2014 con un costo de miles de millones de d\u00f3lares para las automotrices y afectando la reputaci\u00f3n de los ejecutivos y las compa\u00f1\u00edas que dirigen.\n\nEl jueves, Honda dijo que altos ejecutivos recortar\u00e1n sus salarios durante los pr\u00f3ximos 90 d\u00edas. La compa\u00f1\u00eda cre\u00f3 un nuevo cargo para supervisar los cambios de seguridad. La compa\u00f1\u00eda cit\u00f3 los llamados a revisi\u00f3n en Jap\u00f3n que involucran problemas de motor y dijo que los recortes de salario no est\u00e1n relacionados a las bolsas de aire defectuosas que la compa\u00f1\u00eda ha comenzado a reemplazar en autos de hace m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada. El presidente de Honda Takanobu Ito ver\u00e1 su remuneraci\u00f3n reducida en 20% por tres meses.\n\n\"Nuestras disculpas m\u00e1s profundas de nuevo por causar una gran cantidad de problemas para nuestros clientes\", dijo Honda. El jueves, la compa\u00f1\u00eda llam\u00f3 a reparaci\u00f3n a 425.825 veh\u00edculos Honda Fit, N-WGN y Vezel en Jap\u00f3n debido a que un problema con la bobina de encendido o el circuito de suministro de electricidad podr\u00eda causar que el motor se detenga.\n\nLos recortes de sueldo son una forma tradicional con la que los ejecutivos japoneses asumen responsabilidad o muestran preocupaci\u00f3n por un mal desempe\u00f1o u otros errores. Honda dijo que su nuevo ejecutivo de seguridad, Koichi Fukuo, tomar\u00e1 medidas para prevenir que los problemas de calidad vuelvan a ocurrir y \"liderar\u00e1 la reforma de la estructura de revisi\u00f3n de seguridad a lo largo y ancho de Honda\".\n\nEl nombramiento, que se presenta luego de la creaci\u00f3n de un cargo similar en Nissan Motor Co. a principios de este a\u00f1o, muestra la creciente preocupaci\u00f3n entre las automotrices japonesas despu\u00e9s que Toyota llegara a un acuerdo extrajudicial de US$1.200 millones este a\u00f1o para cerrar una investigaci\u00f3n criminal sobre c\u00f3mo respondi\u00f3 a varios casos de aceleraci\u00f3n indeseada y una amplia investigaci\u00f3n a General Motors Co sobre c\u00f3mo manej\u00f3 un problema con los interruptores de encendido.",

La propuesta de la compa\u00f1\u00eda, que se comenzar\u00e1 a implementar en los veh\u00edculos de 2015, permitir\u00e1 a los coches identificar peatones y otros elementos para ayudara los conductores en la toma de decisiones.\n\nLos veh\u00edculos inteligentes van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de modelos de conducci\u00f3n aut\u00f3noma o coches conectados. En concreto, se est\u00e1 buscando aportar nuevos sistemas inteligentes a los pr\u00f3ximos modelos que puedan ayudar a aumentar la seguridad. Coches m\u00e1s seguros son una obsesi\u00f3n para los fabricantes y una necesidad para los usuarios. En este sentido la tecnolog\u00eda todav\u00eda tiene mucho que decir.\n\nUna de las empresas que cuenta ya con una soluci\u00f3n inteligente enfocada a mejorar la seguridad es Honda. La compa\u00f1\u00eda cuenta con algunas de las innovaciones tecnol\u00f3gicas m\u00e1s avanzadas del sector y se propone seguir en esa l\u00ednea. En concreto, su \u00faltima apuesta es Honda SENSING, un sistema inteligente que permitir\u00e1 a los coches analizar su entorno.\n\nLa idea de Honda SENSING es que los veh\u00edculos puedan conocer los elementos que est\u00e1n a su alrededor para ayudar a los conductores durante la circulaci\u00f3n. Se trata de una soluci\u00f3n inteligente que promete una conducci\u00f3n asistida m\u00e1s segura, enfocada a que los peatones y el resto de veh\u00edculos se beneficien del aumento de seguridad.\n\nEl sistema Honda SENSING est\u00e1 compuesto por una c\u00e1mara monocular y un radar que permiten identificar los elementos que rodean al veh\u00edculo en un radio de 60 metros. SENSING analiza los datos que se van captando y ayuda a los conductores en la toma de decisiones. As\u00ed, el sistema es capaz de diferenciar entre elementos como veh\u00edculos y peatones y ayuda a los conductores en las maniobras.\n\nEl sistema inteligente planteado por Honda est\u00e1 enfocado a mejorar la seguridad y minimizar al m\u00e1ximo las posibilidades de que se produzca un fallo humano. Al detectar peatones en la trayectoria del veh\u00edculo, Honda SENSING ayuda a reducir velocidad o a cambiar de trayectoria, de manera que el conductor cuente con un complemento para evitar accidentes.\n\nInterpretaci\u00f3n de la circulaci\u00f3n\n\nEl potencial de Honda SENSING tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 pensado para ser una herramienta \u00fatil durante la circulaci\u00f3n. El sistema es capaz de medir distancias y ayudar a los usuarios a ser conscientes de los veh\u00edculos a su alrededor. As\u00ed, se busca que en casos de alta densidad se pueda mantener siempre una distancia segura entre coches y que no haya ning\u00fan elemento que pase desapercibido.\n\nLas opciones de Honda SENSING tambi\u00e9n incluyen funciones enfocadas a alertar sobre desviaciones fuera del carril, que se notifican a trav\u00e9s de mensajes e incluso un sistema de vibraci\u00f3n en el volante. Esta funci\u00f3n puede ser especialmente \u00fatil para prevenir accidentes por relajaci\u00f3n o desfallecimiento del conductor.\n\nAyuda en el frenado y la direcci\u00f3n en funci\u00f3n de la situaci\u00f3n de la circulaci\u00f3n son otras de las posibilidades de Honda SENSING, que promete ser uno de los asistentes de conducci\u00f3n m\u00e1s completos hasta ahora. Por ejemplo, esta herramienta impedir\u00eda arrancar con demasiada velocidad si hay un obst\u00e1culo a corta distancia.\n\nLos primeros veh\u00edculos de Honda con SENSING se estrenar\u00e1n a finales de este a\u00f1o en Jap\u00f3n. Los planes de la compa\u00f1\u00eda son que de cara a 2015 esta tecnolog\u00eda llegue a m\u00e1s modelos a nivel global, ampliando as\u00ed su radio de acci\u00f3n.",
