The paper contacted the British Columbia Health Ministry and received a response back saying that \"biomedical waste,\" including \"human tissue\" and \"fetal tissue\" are being disposed of through officially approved contractors.

According to the report in the London Telegraph newspaper, the aborted babies were incinerated as \"clinical waste\" in \"waste to energy\" plans at British hospitals.\n The hospitals, funded by the British government's NHS health care program, admitted burning the babies' bodies along with legitimate medical waste and trash.

The bodies of over 15,000 aborted and miscarried babies were incinerated as clinical waste, with some used to heat hospitals, in the last two years alone.\n Worldwide outrage ensued.  Mothers were not consulted about how their babies remains should be disposed.  The Department of Health insists the practice has been ended.\n Writing for the B.C.

                    "body": "Even though there is now a stay of execution from officials of an energy plant in Oregon reportedly burning aborted babies from Canada to generate electricity, blame government-funded environmentalists of the day and their their main 'Panderer in chief' President Barack Obama for a coming trend that allows burning babies for electricity.\n Following a LifeNews story below that is going viral, the Marion County Board of Commissioners issued the following statement:\n\"Today the Marion County Board of Commissioners learned that the Covanta Waste-to-Energy Facility located in Marion County may be accepting medical waste containing human tissue from outside sources.  In response to an April 21 article in The B.C Catholic, the board took immediate action to temporarily halt the acceptance of boxed medical waste at the facility.  \"(LifesiteNews.c com, April 24, 2014).\n Notice the use of the word \"temporarily\" in the Marion County Board of Commissioners statement.\n And Oregon, British Columbia its provider, along with the United Kingdom are only the three places as revealed in the space of one month are the only ones being written about.\n The never-ending push by radical environmentalists to bankrupt the fossil fuel industry has already led to the burning of children for fuel in two countries.  Environmentalists are more worried about \"wolf's blood\" than babies' blood and Obama is leading the pack.\n The lib-left, who have a track record for trying to justify everything, call the product for this increasing new energy trend \"biomedical waste\", but biomedical waste is just a deceitful term for fuel provided from aborted babies.\n \"The British Columbia Health Ministry has admitted that the remains of babies destroyed by abortion in B.C. facilities are ending up in a waste-to-power facility in the United States, providing electricity for residents of Oregon.  (LifeSiteNews.c com)\n\"The province's Health Ministry said in an email to the B.C. Catholic that \"biomedical waste\" shipped to the U.S. to be incinerated includes \"human tissue, such as surgically removed cancerous tissue, amputated limbs, and fetal tissue.\" \"\n\"The ministry understands that some is transferred to Oregon.  There it is incinerated in a waste-to-energy plant,\" the email stated.\n \"The ministry said that contractors handling the province's \"biomedical waste\" follow \"health and safety protocols, as well as federal, provincial, and local regulations.\" \"\n\"Kristan Mitchell, executive director of the Oregon Refuse and Recycling Association, told the B.C. Catholic that the \"biomedical waste\" likely ends up at the Covanta Marion waste-to-energy facility in Oregon since it is the only facility that uses waste to power the grid.  The facility confirmed that it still receives and incinerates B.C. medical waste.\n \"The power facility, located in Brookes just off the I-5, burns waste in two massive boilers at a temperature of about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  The heat transfers into water tubes, which creates steam to drive turbines.  The turbines generate electricity.\n \"A 2007 article about the Marion waste-to-energy facility that appeared in the Willamette Live -- ironically titled \"Burn, Baby, Burn\" -- stated that at the time the incinerator burned about 800 tons (1,764,000 pounds) of medical waste per year.\n \"Medical waste is brought to the facility in sealed boxes and is carried to the furnace on a conveyor belt which layers it with the rest of the solid waste being processed,\" the article states.\n (As if babies' bodies and parts being delivered in sealed boxes before being shunted along to the raging furnace on a conveyor belt that \"layers\" them with the rest of the solid waste being processed, makes it any more ethical.  )\n\"Locals at the time protested the \"importation and burning of medical waste,\" expressing concern about breathing \"toxic emissions.\" \" (LifeSite.c com)\nAt least the locals didn't cry about the \"blood of wolves\" like the environmentalists did.\n \"The news comes one month after the remains of more than 15,000 aborted babies were found to have been incinerated, along with other \"medical waste,\" to heat and generate power for British hospitals.  \"\nIn short, Obama's war on fossil fuels and his speech promises for the provision of new energy sources has led to the \"Burn, Baby, Burn\" nightmare of today.\n The Frankenstein Fossil Fuel of the moment is Canada's Keystone XL Pipeline.\n \"Keystone has become a political issue and the announcement by the Obama State Department that is giving agencies \"additional time\" to approve its construction due to ongoing litigation before the Nebraska Supreme Court that could affect its route brought forth protests from red-state Democrats in Congress who even threatened to find ways to go around the President to get the project approved.  Eleven Democratic senators have written to the President to urge him to make a final decision by the end of May.  Some of them will be up for reelection in the November midterm elections.\n \"Even Congress, though, seems incapable of over-ruling or overcoming Obama's war on the provision of energy sources.  In early April, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) released new data showing that federal onshore oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits are at the lowest levels in more than a decade.  \"Leases to companies exploring the potential of oil and natural gas reserves were down in 2013 from 1.8 million acres the year before to 1.2 million, the smallest area since records began to be maintained in 1988!  (Canada Free Press, April 22, 2014)\nLow information voters have yet to catch on that their hero Obama is almost as callous towards the third world poor as he is toward the unborn.\n While his ''selfie' at the Mandela Memorial saturated worldwide publicity on his African tour, he told the people of South Africa that they must remain poor for the good of the world.  According to President Obama:\n\"Ultimately, if you think about all the youth that everybody has mentioned here in Africa, if everybody is raising living standards to the point where everybody has got a car and everybody has got air conditioning, and everybody has got a big house, well, the planet will boil over -- unless we find new ways of producing energy.\" \"\n\"While it was all part of a push for a new \"green energy\" initiative in Africa, the arrogance of the statement is quite stunning.  Obama went on to claim that global warming is the largest environmental crisis the world faces, even larger than air and water pollution.  However, according to UNESCO unsanitized water leads to billions of deaths annually from diarrhea, cholera, malaria, intestinal parasites, and other illnesses.  In contrast, the World Health Organization claims that 140,000 people die annually from the effects of global warming.  So, if the President wants to help the world's poor perhaps he needs to focus on cheap energy more than clean energy.  Even better, perhaps he should get out of the world's business and focus on his own nation that is currently in a death spiral.  This clearly shows that global warming is nothing but a political power grab.\" \" (CNSNews.c com)\n\"President Obama voted against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act four times, horrifyingly voting against protecting babies who survived abortion and voting in favor of leaving them to die.  (LifeNews).\n In the U.S., a federal statute defines \"partial-birth abortion\" as any abortion in which the fetus is extracted \"past the navel [of the fetus]... outside the body of the mother,\" or \"in the case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother,\" if the fetus has already passed.  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the terms \"partial-birth abortion\" and \"intact dilation and extraction\" are basically synonymous.  However, there are cases where these overlapping terms do not coincide.  For example, the IDX procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g. due to a miscarriage or feticide) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction.  Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of \"partial-birth abortion,\" which specifies that partial live delivery must precede \"the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered, living fetus.\" \" Additionally, a doctor may extract a baby past the navel and then cut through the neck of the fetus.  This could fall within the terms of the statute, even though it would not result in an intact body and therefore would not be an intact dilation and extraction.  (Wikipedia)\nIn layman's language, the baby's spine is severed with surgical scissors and left to die.\n Being a champion of partial birth abortion, Obama is an unabashed killer of babies.  Millions of babies are killed by abortion annually, and that's not counting the money sent off shore to cover millions of more international abortions.\n As the champion of abortion, including partial birth abortion, how long was it before Obama would begin paving the way for incinerating aborted babies to generate electricity in industrialized nations?",

                    "body": "Bolsas llenas de desechos radioactivos fueron halladas abandonadas en un edificio en el estado de Dakota del Norte.  AP\nEn una estaci\u00f3n de servicio desierta en una ciudad remota del estado de Dakota del Norte, en Estados Unidos, funcionarios descubrieron hace poco un derivado indeseado del auge del gas de esquito: cientos de bolsas de basura llenas de desechos levemente radioactivos.\n Estas bolsas, que fueron descubiertas a fines de febrero en la localidad de Noonan, conten\u00edan lo que se conoce como \"calcetines de petr\u00f3leo\": filtros serpenteantes de casi un metro de largo hechos de fibra absorbente.  La industria del petr\u00f3leo de esquisto usa las bolsas para capturar los residuos de agua que deja la fracturaci\u00f3n hidr\u00e1ulica.\n D\u00edas antes, hubo un hallazgo similar en camiones de remolque cerca de un vertedero de basura en Watford City, que, como Nooman, est\u00e1 ubicada en la parte occidental del estado, donde se ubican las formaciones de esquito de Bakken.\n Ambos incidentes muestran que los reguladores de Dakota del Norte no han atendido con celeridad las repercusiones del aumento en la producci\u00f3n de crudo, que va desde una abundancia de gas natural en pozos petroleros hasta plataformas de perforaci\u00f3n en tierras hist\u00f3ricas.\n La mayor parte del material radioactivo en las bolsas de petr\u00f3leo proviene de sedimentos filtrados en el proceso de bombeo de agua desechada a pozos de inyecci\u00f3n.  El radio, que se encuentra en la tierra, las rocas y el agua, se acumula en los sedimentos filtrados.\n \"Antes del auge petrolero de Bakken no se generaban ninguno de estos materiales\", afirm\u00f3 Scott Radig, director de gesti\u00f3n de desechos del estado.  \"As\u00ed que no era un problema\".\n Los niveles de radiaci\u00f3n de estas bolsas de petr\u00f3leo son bastante bajos: funcionarios de Dakota del Norte afirman que una persona podr\u00eda pararse durante un a\u00f1o al lado de un contenedor de basura lleno de estas bolsas y recibir menos radiaci\u00f3n en la piel que al sacarse una radiograf\u00eda dental.  El descubrimiento de grandes cantidades de desechos radioactivos mal almacenados y abandonados ha desatado la indignaci\u00f3n de la gente.\n En respuesta, el estado aprob\u00f3 una nueva ley que a partir del 1 de junio exigir\u00e1 a la industria del petr\u00f3leo de esquisto usar contenedores a prueba de filtraciones para almacenar temporalmente las bolsas en las zonas de los pozos.\n Dakota del Norte ya exige que luego los filtros sean trasladados por \"transportistas de desechos con licencia\" hacia instalaciones de desecho autorizadas.\n El problema es que el estado no tiene ni un solo lugar de almacenamiento capaz de gestionar desechos radioactivos, y ahora tiene entre 500 y 600 pozos de inyecci\u00f3n que producen las bolsas.\n Varios otros estados -- Idaho, Colorado, Utah, y en cierta medida Montana -- designaron vertederos para desechos con niveles de radiaci\u00f3n por encima del promedio.  Instalaciones en Montana aceptan materiales con niveles de radiaci\u00f3n de menos de 30 picocurios (una medida de radioactividad) por gramo, mientras en Idaho toleran niveles de hasta 1.500.\n \"Hay tanto prisa por sacar el petr\u00f3leo que las reglas y leyes no siguen el ritmo del desarrollo\", afirma Wayde Schafer, director de la filial local de la organizaci\u00f3n ecologista Sierra Club.\n El desecho ilegal o almacenamiento de desechos radioactivos en Dakota del Norte son multados con hasta US$10.000 por incidente adem\u00e1s de una multa de US$1.000 por desechos ilegales est\u00e1ndar, se\u00f1alan funcionarios estatales.\n Operadores de plantas de desechos analizan la basura con detectores de radiaci\u00f3n, y tienen autoridad para imponer multas a quienes incumplen las normativas.\n El volumen de desechos de filtros con niveles de radiaci\u00f3n que requieren instalaciones de desecho especializadas en Dakota del Norte ahora oscila entre un m\u00ednimo de ocho toneladas diarias a varias veces esa cifra, seg\u00fan funcionarios estatales y de la industria.\n Nadie sabe d\u00f3nde terminan todos esos residuos, afirman empresas especializadas en desechar basura radioactiva.  Pero creen que la mayor\u00eda son manejados adecuadamente para evitar fuertes multas.",
