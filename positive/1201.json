Much of the money that allegedly changed hands went through U.S. banks, which is why U.S. officials were able to bring charges.\n\nSeven of the 14 individuals were arrested Wednesday morning in Zurich ahead of a FIFA meeting and Friday's presidential election in which Sepp Blatter is expected to win a fifth term. Both Russia's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko and the country's Football Union have openly expressed the desire to see Blatter re-elected to the position, the R-sport news site reported Thursday.\n\nIn a separate probe, Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings into FIFA's awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar.\n\nPutin said even if \"someone has done something wrong,\" Russia \"has nothing to do with it.\" He then tried to portray the probe as a U.S. attempt to go after dissenters, likening the case to the persecution of whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.\n\n\"Our American counterparts, unfortunately, are using the same methods to reach their goals and illegally persecute people. I don't rule out that this is the case in relation to FIFA,\" Putin said. \"I have no doubt that this is yet another evident attempt to derail Mr. Blatter's re-election as FIFA president. We are aware of the pressure that he was subjected to in relation to Russia holding the 2018 World Cup.\"\n\nMutko, who is also a FIFA executive committee member and is in Zurich for the governing body's congress and presidential election, said Wednesday that his country welcomes the investigation.\n\nSince then, the sports minister has turned to the media in a bid to clear Russia's name.\n\nAmid swirling speculation that he would be pulled into the investigation launched by Switzerland's attorney general, Mutko denied in comments to the Russian News Service that he faced questioning in connection with the scandal.\n\nIn comments carried by the TASS news agency on Wednesday, he asserted that the arrests of the FIFA officials in Zurich were not tied to Russia's successful bid to host the World Cup in 2018.\n\nMutko reiterated to the R-sport news site that Russia had won the right to host the 2018 World Cup honestly, insisting that Russia would do \"no worse\" at hosting the tournament than England, which lost to Russia in its own bid to host the 2018 World Cup.\n\nRussia is currently preparing to host the competition in 11 cities, including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi.\n\nPrime Minister Dmitry Medvedev estimated in 2013 that hosting the World Cup would cost the country $20 billion, a sum double what then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin predicted when Russia was awarded the tournament in 2010. Other estimates put the final figure closer to $50 billion, approximately the same sum spent on the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the most recent corruption scandal, FIFA spokesman Walter de Gregorio said that Russia would not be stripped of the right to host the upcoming edition of the World Cup.\n\nAnd despite Putin's insinuations about its own role in perpetuating the scandal, the United States appears to agree that Russia was not at risk of losing the tournament. The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Thursday saying that the investigation into FIFA launched by U.S. officials had \"nothing to do with Russia,\" and that the country would in fact host the 2018 World Cup.",

Seven of the 14 were arrested Wednesday morning in Zurich ahead of a FIFA meeting and Friday's presidential election in which Sepp Blatter is expected to win a fifth term.\n\nIn a separate probe, Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings into FIFA's awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 tournament to Qatar.\n\nPutin said even if \"someone has done something wrong,\" Russia \"has nothing to do with it.\" He then tried to portray the probe as a U.S. attempt to go after dissenters, likening the case to the persecution of whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.\n\n\"Our American counterparts, unfortunately, are using the same methods to reach their goals and illegally persecute people. I don't rule out that this is the case in relation to FIFA,\" Putin said. \"I have no doubt that this is yet another evident attempt to derail Mr. Blatter's re-election as FIFA president.

He compared it to the U.S. pursuit of whistle-blowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.\n\nSwiss prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had uncovered \"irregularities\" in the selection of Russia and Qatar as host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments as the U.S. indicted top FIFA officials over an alleged 24-year scheme involving $150 million in bribes from sports marketing executives, the biggest corruption scandal to hit the governing body of the world's most popular sport.\n\n'Selfish Goals'\n\n\"Unfortunately, our American partners are using such methods to reach their own selfish goals and are doing it illegally, persecuting people,\" Putin said. If any wrongdoing occurred, \"it didn't happen on U.S. territory and the U.S. has nothing to do with it,\" he said.\n\nSwiss authorities said they'll be questioning 10 people who voted on the award of the World Cup to Russia and Qatar as part of their investigations into allegations of \"criminal mismanagement and of money-laundering.\"\n\nRussia has \"many questions\" about the investigation, which is \"another case of the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in a website statement late Wednesday. \"We hope that this will by no means be used to cast a shadow on the international soccer organization in general and the decisions it is taking,\" he said.\n\n'Fair Play'\n\nRussia's World Cup Organizing Committee said that its bid campaign was made \"in full compliance with FIFA rules\" and that its representatives \"acted ethically and in a spirit of fair play throughout,\" according to an e-mailed statement.\n\nThere are \"no such accusations\" from Swiss prosecutors against Russia over alleged bribery in the award of the 2018 tournament, Sports Minister Vitaliy Mutko said in a phone interview from Zurich. The \"contract is signed\" and Russia is \"continuing preparations\" to host the tournament, he said.\n\nRussia is spending 665 billion rubles (almost $13 billion) on preparations to stage the World Cup for the first time and Putin has staked his prestige on hosting major sports tournaments. Last year Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\n\"At its root this has nothing to do with Russia,\" said Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-linked political analyst. \"This is about Washington taking control of FIFA.\"\n\n'Discredit Russia'\n\nThe U.S., which is locked in a dispute with Putin over the conflict in Ukraine, will use the scandal to step up pressure for Russia to be stripped of the right to host the tournament, Markov said. \"The political benefits can be huge,\" he said.\n\n\"In Russia any such scandal is seen as a part of campaign to discredit Russia and they will see it not as fight against corruption but as a fight against Russia,\" said Alexander Baunov, senior associate in the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\nThe U.S. and Swiss investigations promise to upend an organization that has endured a series of scandals during Blatter's tenure, which began in 1998. FIFA said Wednesday that the presidential election, as well as the World Cup tournaments in Russia and Qatar, would take place as planned.\n\nTwo U.S. senators, Democrat Bob Menendez and Republican John McCain, on Tuesday urged FIFA not to re-elect Blatter for his fifth term as president in light of his \"continued support\" for Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIn a letter to the FIFA Congress, the senators said the economic benefits from hosting the tournament would contravene the sanctions imposed on Russia over its intervention in Ukraine. The body should elect a president who'll \"work to deny the Putin regime the privilege\" of staging the World Cup, it said.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe are locked in their worst confrontation with Russia since the Cold War over the Russian annexation of Crimea and the more than yearlong conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which Putin is accused of supporting pro-Russian separatists. The Kremlin denies U.S. and European Union accusations that Russia has sent troops and weapons to support the rebels.",

Putin on Thursday denounced the arrests of top FIFA officials in Zurich as \"another blatant attempt by the United States to extend its jurisdiction to other states.\"\n\nMr. Putin's comments, a transcript of which was posted on the Kremlin website on Thursday, were an unscheduled defense of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and of Sepp Blatter, its president, whom Mr. Putin implied the United States was trying to topple.\n\n\"We know about the pressure that he has been put under to cancel the 2018 World Cup in Russia,\" Mr. Putin said at an overnight news conference. Asked whether that pressure could endanger Russia's plans to hold the World Cup, Mr. Putin said: \"I don't know. This does not concern us.\"\n\nAfter the arrests on Wednesday, Swiss prosecutors announced a criminal investigation into the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Russia's World Cup plans survived an internal FIFA investigation last year, but the Russian bidding team had refused to turn over their computers. All equipment used in the bidding process had subsequently been destroyed, they said.\n\nIn a telephone interview from Zurich on Wednesday, Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister, denied that the Russian bidding committee had used bribery to ensure that his country would host the World Cup. An impartial investigation turned up nothing, he said.\n\n\"So once again, they're going to go through the case, once again they're going to question people,\" Mr. Mutko said. \"You know, you can talk about corruption for as long as humanity will continue to exist.\"\n\nAfter defending Mr. Blatter's reputation, Mr. Putin went on the offensive against the United States.\n\n\"We know the United States' position on the former N.S.A. agent Snowden, who uncovered illegal acts by the United States around the globe,\" Mr. Putin said, referring to the National Security Agency, for which Mr. Snowden worked as a contractor before exposing and denouncing some of its methods and fleeing to Russia. \"Everyone, including Europe, is talking about this but nobody wants to give him asylum, guarantee his safety, nobody wants to quarrel with their partners, their old partners.\"\n\nMr. Putin then moved on to Mr. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has eluded prosecution by taking refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since June 2012.\n\n\"What is he being persecuted for?\" Mr. Putin asked. \"For sex crimes? Nobody believes that. You don't believe that.\"\n\nMr. Snowden now lives in Russia, where he is believed to be under the protection of the security services. Mr. Assange had a short-lived show on the government-financed television station RT.\n\n\"Why have I recalled all this?\" Mr. Putin asked himself. \"Unfortunately, our American partners use these methods to achieve their selfish goals and persecute people illegally. I don't rule out that this may be the same case with FIFA.\"",

                    "body": "Vladimir Putin condemned the U.S. after authorities arrested several high-level FIFA officials for corruption. The Russian President insists that the investigation is revenge against FIFA President Sepp Blatter, after he refused to deny Russia a bid to host the World Cup. Russia won the bid to host the international football competition in 2018; Qatar will host the games in 2022.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has indicted 18 people in the FIFA corruption probe. Seven have been arrested in Switzerland and face extradition. The U.S. Justice Department suspects them of receiving $150 million dollars in bribes. U.S. authorities allege that businessmen secured marketing rights, clothing sponsorship deals and other lucrative contracts from the games with bribery and fraud.\n\nA parallel investigation from Switzerland is looking into potential \"money mismanagement\" in the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes, bringing Russia and Qatar into the fray.\n\nAccording to CNN, some people, like British Prime Minister David Cameron, are calling for FIFA President Blatter to step down. He will soon face reelection from the Congress of FIFA officials for a fifth term. Although things look dark for the Blatter, the embattled president has one staunch ally: Vladimir Putin.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Putin insists that the only reason America is suddenly interested in FIFA corruption is that Blatter ignored requests to bar Russia from the bidding process.\n\n\"Unfortunately, our American partners are using such methods to reach their own selfish goals and are doing it illegally, persecuting people. (If any wrongdoing occurred) it didn't happen on U.S. territory and the U.S. has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama and high-level officials in the executive have not weighed in on Putin's statements or whether Blatter should resign, but a few senators did.\n\nIn a letter to the FIFA Congress, Senators John McCain and Robert Menendez called out Putin and Blatter, asking the congress to reconsider its support.\n\n\"In light of President Blatter's continued support Russia hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup -- despite Russia's ongoing violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity and other challenges to the post-WWII security architecture -- we ask that you reconsider your support for President Blatter's fifth term as FIFA President.\"\n\nState Department spokesman Jeffrey Rathke tried to counter Putin, according to Yahoo News, saying the arrests had nothing to do with influencing the FIFA president's reelection.\n\n\"There's a clear message from the United States that... corrupt conduct is not acceptable. And that's the focus of the indictment and our cooperation in the arrests yesterday.\"\n\nHe went on to say that the corruption probe should have no effect on Russian-U.S. relations.\n\nStill, Vladimir Putin went on to criticize the U.S. for jumping to conclusions before a fair trial.\n\n\"The United States Attorney General has already stated that these officers of the FIFA executive committee have committed a crime, as though (the) prosecutor is unaware of the presumption of innocence. Only a court can find a person guilty or not guilty, and only after that can anyone say anything.\"\n\nWith Vladimir Putin's comments, it looks like the FIFA investigation has become a little more interesting.\n\n[Image Credit: Getty Images]",

                    "body": "Who knew Russian President Vladimir Putin cared so much about embattled FIFA president Sepp Blatter?\n\nLast night, in response to a reporter's question, Putin offered his views on the revelation that the US will prosecute a number of current and former FIFA officers for corruption. As a commentary on the prosecutions, his thoughts were utterly wrong: he claimed that there were no US citizens involved in the case (there are several), and that the alleged crimes had nothing to do with the US or its territory (they did).\n\nBut as a commentary on Putin's deepest, darkest fears about the United States, his response was quite illuminating. Putin believes the US uses its power covertly to interfere in foreign affairs, undermining unfriendly governments and then replacing them with more pliant leaders after they crumble.\n\nThat's what he thinks happened in Ukraine. That's what he thinks the US is trying to do to his regime in Russia. And apparently it's also what he thinks is behind the FIFA prosecution:\n\nAs we all know, on Friday FIFA was to elect its president, and Mr Blatter has every chance to be re-elected. We are aware of the pressure that was put on him to prevent the 2018 World Cup in Russia. We know of his views, which have nothing to do with any special relations between FIFA and Russia.\n\n[...]\n\nThis is yet another obvious attempt to spread their jurisdiction to other states.I have no doubt that this is obviously an attempt to prevent Mr Blatter's re-election to the post of FIFA President, which is a grave violation of the principles that international organisations function on.\n\nPutin thinks the US has gone after FIFA now as part of a covert attempt to bring down its leader, Sepp Blatter. Who, wouldn't you know it, seems to Putin to be a friendly and right-thinking person who supported Russia's successful bid for the 2018 World Cup and has every right to remain in power.\n\nIn reality, of course, this is a pretty outlandish interpretation of events. The FIFA corruption prosecution isn't some sort of political vendetta or crazy international overreach. Rather, it arose out of wrongdoing by a US citizen, Chuck Blazer, who failed to pay any US taxes from 2005 to 2010 and then agreed to provide evidence about other FIFA wrongdoing as part of a plea agreement.\n\nThe other defendants include US citizens and a US company, along with their foreign co-conspirators. CONCACAF, one of the main FIFA regional entities at issue in the case, has its administrative offices in the US. FIFA's decision to award Russia the World Cup isn't at issue in the indictment. And Blatter isn't among the FIFA officials charged.\n\nBut that's the point: Putin's fear of US aggression and interference is so deep that he sees it everywhere, regardless of whether that's actually reasonable. His answers were based on his general concerns about the United States, not on the specifics of the FIFA case.\n\nPutin's fear of the US has had a deep impact on the way he governs Russia. Vladimir Ryzhkov, a Russian analyst and opposition politician, explained to me in a meeting several weeks ago that Putin fears the US will use \"maidan technology\" (i.e., popular protests engineered from outside) to bring down his regime. That fear, Ryzhkov said, is the cause of the severe crackdown on civil liberties and freedom of association that has taken place in Russia in recent years.\n\nOf course, there are political benefits to seeing US plots everywhere: that frame allows Putin to blame the US for Russia's problems while he takes credit for its successes. But Putin isn't just chasing an advantageous narrative. He genuinely believes the US is trying to bring down his regime, as he believes it has already done in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Russia had mass protests in 2011, Ryzhkov explained, Putin was \"very much afraid\" that they were an outside plot sponsored by the US. \"He does not believe that people came to Bolotnaya and Sakharova [the main squares where protests were held in Moscow] voluntarily. He really believes they've been inspired, and maybe paid, by Americans.\" The next year, Ukraine's Euromaidan protest movement reinforced those fears -- especially when Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was photographed handing out cookies to the protesters.\n\nWhen Putin looks at FIFA, he sees Russia. And when he looks at the prosecution, he sees a frightening vision of the future.",

                    "body": "The governing body of world soccer, FIFA, can count on the support of at least one major global corporation in its efforts to retain sponsors and survive corruption charges: Gazprom, the Russian state-owned natural-gas supplier. That's because Russia views U.S. prosecutors' charges against FIFA as an attack on its interests.\n\nGazprom's reaction to the FIFA scandal contrasts with that of other major corporate sponsors -- such as Visa Inc., which has threatenedto remove its support. The Russian company, one of FIFA's five major partners for the 2018 World Cup, said unequivocally that the U.S. indictments will not affect the relationship. Apparently, Russian President Vladimir Putin sees the continued reign of President Joseph Blatter at FIFA as a guarantee that Russia will host the tournament as planned. This, in turn, will give Putin the opportunity to demonstrate that his falling out with the West over Ukraine hasn't undermined his ability to put on a lavish, world-class show like last year's Sochi Olympics.\n\nBack in 2010, when the FIFA executive committee met in Switzerland to decide which countries would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, Putin stayed away, ostensiblyto avoid appearances of corruption and to allow the decision to be made \"without any outside pressure.\" In his place, he sent Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who gave a comical speechin atrocious English.\n\nActually, Putin may have already known who would win. A report from The Sunday Times' investigative team, published last year by the British parliament, said that Putin -- with the help of various Russian officials, friendly billionaires and a Qatari named Mohammed Bin Hammam, then head of the Asian Football Confederation -- arranged a vote exchange in which Russia would get the 2018 tournament and Qatar would get 2022.\n\nThe U.S. indictment says nothing about the bidding process that led to the 2010 vote, but it does mention Bin Hammam, since disgraced and banned from soccer. He appears as \"Co-Conspirator #7,\" who bribed other FIFA officials to support his bid for FIFA presidency in 2011. It's easy to imagine how the U.S. investigation could move from there to Bin Hammam's role in the 2010 vote. If Putin, who prefers ice hockey to soccer, saw winning the original bid as important enough for Russia to warrant some backroom dealing, a re-vote could be humiliating.\n\nHence, Putin and his team have been steadfast in their support of Blatter and the FIFA hierarchy. Putin Wednesday called the indictments an attempt by the U.S. to \"stretch its jurisdiction to other countries\" and \"a blatant violation of the principles on which international organizations function.\" Kremlin-loyal political scientist Sergei Markov went farther in a Facebook post, calling the U.S. move \"a hostile takeover of FIFA\" in which \"the global hegemon gets new, unique ways of influencing many countries' policies through its influence on soccer, the game of millions.\" Though the European soccer organization, UEFA, called for the FIFA presidential election to be postponed from Friday and even threatened to boycott it, Russia, a UEFA member, announced its intention to vote for Blatter. \"FIFA must fight back,\" Mutko said in Zurich.\n\nBlatter has a good chance of winning the vote if it is held tomorrow, despite the support that his rival, Jordanian Prince Ali Al Hussein, has garnered from some of the biggest European soccer countries, including world champion Germany. Blatter's backing is strong among Asian and African soccer federations, which he has greatly empowered and enriched. They, and Russia, encourage him to throw down the gauntlet in the face of the U.S. challenge.\n\nThat said, Blatter's resistance might ultimately do both him and Putin a disservice. U.S. investigators, who say FIFA is rotten from the top down, are likely to see defiance as a challenge. If they dig deeper into the World Cup bidding process, they may get results soon enough to move the 2018 tournament from Russia, which has already spent part of its $12.5 billion budget on stadiums, airports and other infrastructure.",

The \"contract is signed\" for Russia to host the World Cup and \"we're continuing preparations,\" he said.\n\nMutko, who was in the Zurich hotel where FIFA officials were arrested, said nobody in the Russian delegation has been questioned by police, though they're ready to respond to inquiries.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, whose country is spending 665 billion rubles (almost $13 billion) on preparations to host the World Cup for the first time, has staked his prestige on staging major sports tournaments. Last year Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\n\"At its root this has nothing to do with Russia,\" said Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-linked political analyst. \"This is about Washington taking control of FIFA.\"\n\nHost Pressure\n\nThe embattled president of FIFA, Joseph \"Sepp\" Blatter, 79, is standing for re-election on Friday. The European soccer association, UEFA, called for the election to be postponed in a statement issued late Wednesday that said \"corruption is deeply rooted in FIFA's culture.\"\n\nThe U.S., which is locked in a dispute with Putin over the conflict in Ukraine, will use the scandal to step up pressure for Russia to be stripped of the right to host the tournament, Markov said. \"The political benefits can be huge,\" he said.\n\n\"In Russia any such scandal is seen as a part of campaign to discredit Russia and they will see it not as fight against corruption but as a fight against Russia,\" said Alexander Baunov, senior associate in the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\nThe U.S. and Swiss investigations promise to upend an organization that has endured a series of scandals during Blatter's tenure, which began in 1998. FIFA said Wednesday that the presidential election, as well as the World Cups in Russia and Qatar, would take place as planned.\n\nSanctions Call\n\nTwo U.S. senators, Democrat Bob Menendez and Republican John McCain, on Tuesday urged FIFA not to re-elect Blatter for his fifth term as president in light of his \"continued support\" for Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup.\n\nIn a letter to the FIFA Congress, the senators said the economic benefits from hosting the tournament would contravene the sanctions imposed on Russia over its intervention in Ukraine. The body should elect a president who'll \"work to deny the Putin regime the privilege\" of staging the World Cup, it said.\n\nThe U.S. and Europe are locked in their worst confrontation with Russia since the Cold War over a more than yearlong conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which Putin is accused of supporting pro-Russian separatists. The Kremlin denies U.S. and European Union accusations that Russia has sent troops and weapons to support the rebels.",

                    "body": "A day after the Justice Department charged several top FIFA officials with racketeering, wire fraud, and money-laundering conspiracies, the takes and statements are flying in nonstop. Most involve Schadenfreude or at least condemnation, but soccer's international orchestrator still has at least one friend left -- Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Russian president managed to connect the FIFA indictment to Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. In regards to the situation of the former contractor who revealed NSA's data collecting, \"Everyone,\" Putin said, \"including Europe, is talking about this but nobody wants to give him asylum, guarantee his safety, nobody wants to quarrel with their partners, their old partners.\" He then moved on to the Wikileaks founder. \"What is he being persecuted for?\" Putin asked. \"For sex crimes? Nobody believes that. You don't believe that.\"\n\nHe then tied everything together with a neat bow. \"Why have I recalled all this? Unfortunately, our American partners use these methods to achieve their selfish goals and persecute people illegally. I don't rule out that this may be the same case with FIFA.\"\n\nRussia is scheduled to host the 2018 World Cup. The United States launched an unsuccessful bid to host the World Cup in 2022; Qatar won the bid, and the indictment questions whether bribes were instrumental to these picks. In Qatar, about a thousand migrant workers have died while building new stadiums. The World Cup was moved from summer to winter to avoid the sweltering hot temperatures. With Russia, there were worries about how the country would be able to build massive stadiums in time for the tournament when Russia just spent so much on the Olympics.\n\n\"We know about the pressure,\" Putin said, \"that he has been put under to cancel the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\"\n\nThe U.S. government isn't alone in condemning FIFA. Several World Cup sponsors -- including Coca-Cola, McDonald's, and Visa -- have spoken out. \"Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today's developments is profound,\" Visa said in a statement yesterday.\n\nFIFA is still scheduled to start its annual Congress -- which is why all the officials arrested happened to be in Switzerland. The organization's president, Sepp Blatter, was not listed on the indictment, and has declined to postpone Friday's election. Some European officials were wondering whether to boycott the Friday election, and have said they would support Blatter's only opponent. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Blatter shouldn't win a fifth term -- and should step down.\n\nThe FIFA president has mostly avoided the press since the charges were announced, although he did address the controversy in his opening speech on Thursday. He didn't say anything new. \"The next few months will not be easy for Fifa,\" Blatter said. \"I'm sure more bad news may follow. But it is necessary to begin to restore trust in our organization. Let this be the turning point.\"\n\nA FIFA spokesperson told reporters earlier, \"He is not a happy man, he is not saying, 'Everything's cool.'\"\n\nOn top of that, it's not clear how much wider the Justice Department's net might reach. At a press conference in New York yesterday, one attorney said, \"It's only just beginning.\"",

Blatter has come under strong pressure to resign as FIFA president in light of the arrests, even as he is hoping to win a fifth mandate at elections scheduled for Friday. Putin claimed pressure had been exerted on the Swiss official to boycott the 2018 World Cup, which is to be held in Russia. Two FIFA vice-presidents are among those arrested on Wednesday pending extradition to the United States in relation to the FBI corruption probe. They are among 14 indicted on graft charges in relation to alleged involvement on bribes of around $100 million over two decades. Meanwhile, Swiss prosecutors announced they had launched a separate investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, with the latter allocated to Qatar.",

                    "body": "Could there be a more fitting champion of FIFA then Vladimir Putin?\n\nAs FIFA President Sepp Blatter heads toward a tense vote later today that will determine whether he will remain in charge of global soccer's governing body, amidst a sweeping bribery scandal that has nabbed some of his top lieutenants and that with any luck will loosen Blatter's Palpatine-like hold over the beautiful game, he at least knows that he has a friend in the Russian strongman.\n\nPutin on Thursday said the charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department against nine FIFA officials and five sports marketing executives were yet \"another blatant attempt to extend [U.S.] jurisdiction to other states.\" In a claim that deserves some kind of award for willful obfuscation, he said U.S. officials were using the same \"methods for achieving their selfish goals\" that they had used to go after Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.\n\nReally, it's hard to think of a more perfect alliance of sleaze. It goes beyond the fact that Russia, as host of the 2018 World Cup, has a vested interest in defending FIFA and its embattled president. The fact is that if FIFA were a country, instead of merely a corrupt international sporting organization, it would look a lot like Russia. And Putin calling attention to this parallel is doing no favors to Blatter.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department's accusation that soccer officials were involved in a decades-long scheme involving $150 million in bribes has put a spotlight on how Blatter runs his operation. The billions of dollars in revenues that FIFA pulls in each year from corporate sponsors, which have long turned a blind eye to FIFA's unscrupulous practices and may have paid kickbacks themselves, trickles down to member nations that make up FIFA, ensuring they have an interest in voting to keep Blatter in power.\n\nSound familiar? That's because it bears remarkable similarities to how Vladimir Putin does business. Ever since the Russian state seized control of the country's biggest industries and handed them over to Putin's cronies, Putin has consolidated power by ensuring that his friends receive a steady stream of the profits that Russia makes from energy, mining, and more.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous column, a microcosm of the Putin model (if a scam so massive can be called a microcosm of anything) can be found in Russia's handling of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, which became the most expensive Olympics in history after Putin handed out infrastructure projects to oligarchic interests that were happy to inflate the costs.\n\nAlso, it's worth remembering that Russia hosted its Winter Olympics in a city without any snow, bumping up the costs even higher. That is not any more absurd than FIFA awarding the 2022 World Cup to the desert kingdom of Qatar, where the government now admits it is way too hot to play outdoor sports in the summer.\n\nThe similarities don't end there. Both Blatter and Putin have used similar rhetorical tactics when confronted with wrongdoing, displaying the autocrat's natural affinity for propaganda and his cynical disregard for the most obvious truths.\n\nLook at how FIFA responded to an internal investigation into allegations that Qatar and Russia had won their World Cup bids through kickbacks: It announced that both countries had been cleared of any illicit behavior whatsoever, an exoneration so unbelievably total that the head of the investigation resigned in protest. Were Putin's justifications for annexing Crimea any less brazen?\n\nBlatter has blamed the latest scandal on \"the actions of a few,\" saying, \"We, or I, cannot monitor everyone all the time.\" He also promised to restore trust in the organization: \"We cannot allow the reputation of FIFA to be dragged through the mud any longer. It has to stop here and now.\" Putin, meanwhile, responded thusly to the recent killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was just one in a long line of Kremlin opponents conveniently dispatched by assassination: \"We need to finally rid Russia of shame and tragedy such as we experienced.\"\n\nBoth men implausibly assert that the head-to-toe rot over which they preside has nothing to do with them -- and both men clearly don't care if no one believes them.\n\nThis is not to imply, of course, that Blatter's transgressions are of the same order as Putin's. It is to point out that there is a pattern to corruption that is discernible at all levels, from the highest to the lowest. And it is a pattern that has only been underscored by the budding alliance between a despot and the most tarnished name in international sports. Lies upon lies, systems of greed, hilariously quixotic vanity projects -- all the hallmarks of deeply embedded corruption are apparent in both Putin's Russia and Blatter's FIFA.",

As we all know, on Friday FIFA was to elect its president, and Mr. Blatter has every chance to be reelected. We are aware of the pressure that was put on him to prevent the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\n\"We know of his views, which have nothing to do with any special relations between FIFA and Russia,\" Putin said, adding that his principled position is that \"it's not right to mix sports and politics.\"\n\nPutin called the U.S. charges filed against soccer officials \"another vivid attempt to spread their jurisdiction on other states.\"\n\nFollow @cjwilliamslat for the latest international news 24/7\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015, Los Angeles Times",

Comey. \"Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA. I want to commend the investigators and prosecutors around the world who have pursued this case so diligently, for so many years.\"\n\nMuch of the attention is related to the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, but Menendez and McCain were critical of Blatter for his backing of holding the 2018 contest in Russia, citing actions by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government in the territory of Ukraine.\n\n\"More than 40 countries, all FIFA members, have imposed sanctions on Russia in an effort to influence events on the ground in Ukraine.

                    "body": "The deeper meaning behind Russian president Vladimir Putin's FIFA comments.\n\nVladimir Putin's full-throated defense of embattled F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) president Sepp Blatter, who has seen the organization's top executives arrested in Switzerland on the basis of U.S. anti-corruption warrants issued in the Southern District of New York, should come as no surprise. Throughout his tenure in office, Putin has made it a point to stand by friends of the Kremlin no matter the charges and to demonstrate that the Russian state will do what it can to defend and support them, particularly when they face trouble in the West.\n\nFor the last several years, the most visible symbol of that steadfastness has been Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad -- whom Putin has refused to abandon or throw under the bus, despite consistent pressure from the United States, and at the expense of concluding lucrative arrangements with the Saudis.\n\nBlatter has defended Russia's winning bid to host the 2018 World Cup -- a sporting event of some prestige and, like the Sochi Winter Olympics, part of Putin's strategy of cementing Russia's post-Soviet recovery -- even against growing calls from Western sporting executives and politicians, including members of the U.S. Congress, who want the event moved from Russia because of its domestic policies and its actions in Ukraine.\n\nMoreover, after charges that Russia used corrupt means to secure its bid surfaced, Blatter presided over a controversial FIFA exoneration of Moscow's efforts. (Certainly, one thing Moscow -- and others -- may be worried about is that secret, subrosa FIFA dealings might now be revealed in U.S. courts.) Because he has come through for the Kremlin, defending it in the world of international football, Putin is not prepared to abandon Blatter anymore than he is ready to accede to U.S. demands to facilitate Assad's departure from power.\n\nPutin wants to send a clear signal, as he has for the past fifteen years, that the Kremlin will take care of those who look out for its interests. It was Putin who offered former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder the appointment to head the Nord Stream pipeline consortium after stepping down from office (and Romano Prodi, after his service as president of the European Commission and prime minister of Italy, was offered the chairmanship of the now-defunct South Stream line -- an offer he declined).\n\nIn contrast to a United States that seems to abandon loyal servitors once they become problematic or get bad media coverage (and the abandonment of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak still resonates not just in the Middle East, but around the world), Putin seems keen on demonstrating his willingness to stand by his friends.\n\nPutin's bigger aim, however, is to turn the narrative away from corruption in FIFA to one of American overreach. The legal grounds for the arrest warrants of non-Americans working in an international sporting federation that is not domiciled in the United States is that specific actions took place on U.S. soil (meetings and payoffs), involving U.S.-based entities, and -- most critically -- the use of U.S. financial institutions as part of a scheme of kickbacks and bribes. Putin claims that this is an exercise in extraterritorial jurisdiction -- an attempt to apply U.S. law beyond its borders for matters that fundamentally occur outside of recognized American jurisdiction. Putin has also subsumed the FIFA affair into his broader critique of the United States (and other Western countries) attempting to impose their systems and values on the rest of the world.\n\nThe first and immediate test will be whether Sepp Blatter is reelected as FIFA president. All 209 football federations cast a single, secret ballot. It will be a test as to whether the Western view of corruption in FIFA prevails, or whether, as Putin seems to suggest, most national federations are comfortable with the Blatter way of doing business and reject Western efforts to dictate what standards are acceptable. This would fit in with Putin's efforts, in recent years, to act as a champion of the \"rest\" against the West, and particularly Western leadership in global institutions.\n\nA longer-term goal is also to persuade more of the movers and shakers of the rising world to avoid the United States and avoid doing business in any American jurisdiction. In the aftermath of U.S. and European sanctions imposed on Russia because of the Ukraine affair, Moscow has accelerated its efforts to encourage the major non-Western states to begin weaning themselves off the use of the dollar as the de facto world reserve currency and to find ways to conduct international business transactions that route around U.S. and European markets. Moscow's own counterboycotts and blacklists have had little impact to date; it is only if they can acquire critical mass through the participation of others that they might have some impact. What will bear watching is whether the FIFA case is used by the Russians to show how even the tangential use of U.S.-based markets and financial institutions opens up non-American businesses and firms to being liable under U.S. law and thus exposed to U.S. legal action leads to a further shift of global business away from U.S. institutions in favor of more congenial climes.\n\nU.S. officials see the FIFA indictments as an example of American leadership in the fight against worldwide corruption -- and expect other countries to be supportive of U.S. efforts. Putin is using it as the latest example of Washington's continued desire to set rules and arbitrate good behavior for the rest of the world. Which narrative will win more hearts and minds around the world?",

Russians working for them could wander behind bars for up to six years.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nThe U.S. State Department and human rights guardians see the law as a tool to repress internal political opponents. In the past, a few of them -- and critical journalists -- have ended up dead or in jail.\n\nTanya Lokshina, Russia program director for Human Rights Watch, said the new law had \"the potential to severely damage our work in Russia.\"\n\nBut she was more concerned about Russian citizens, fearing that even those retweeting \"undesirable\" NGOs posts could land in jail.\n\nMONDAY: Announced surprise military drillsJUST WATCHEDRussia conducts surprise military drillsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\n\nRussia conducts surprise military drills 01:40\n\nWhat he did:\n\nMoscow deployed 12,000 troops, 250 combat planes and helicopters and 689 units of \"various weapons and military equipment\" in its Northwest corner for unannounced military exercises, Russian state media announced Monday.\n\nIt may have been a show of strength in response to a long-planned European fighter jet drill led by Norway, called The Arctic Challenge Exercise. The Russian exercises have dwarfed the NATO members' 4,000 participants.\n\nAnd it involves as many as Cruise missiles will be aimed at an \"imaginary enemy,\" TASS news agency reported.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nHuge Russian drills make NATO particularly nervous. The alliance says past ones were used to deploy troops to annex Crimea and support Russian separatists fighting the government in Ukraine.\n\nNATO also did not like that the Russian drill was unannounced.\n\nWEDNESDAY: Drew harsh words from White HouseJUST WATCHEDVP Biden on what Putin is doing in UkraineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\n\nVP Biden on what Putin is doing in Ukraine 01:15\n\nWhat he did:\n\nOn Wednesday, he incurred the wrath of the White House. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden got his fill of tensions between Russia and the West, and he let loose on Putin. He said the White House is still mulling sending arms and equipment to besieged Ukrainian troops fighting Russia-backed rebels.\n\nBiden criticized Putin for what he called \"brutal aggression\" in Ukraine, and said the Russian president was also responsible for \"aggressive repression at home.\"\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nTop military brass, including Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey, have expressed support for transferring more weapons to Ukraine as it battles Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of the country.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, faced with skepticism from European partners, has so far resisted supplying Ukrainians with lethal aid.\n\nTHURSDAY: Spoke out against FIFA caseJUST WATCHEDRussia reacts to FIFA probeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\n\nRussia reacts to FIFA probe 01:33\n\nWhat he did:\n\nPutin told the United States to butt out of FIFA's affairs on Thursday. Swiss authorities arrested high-ups from the world's soccer governing body -- on corruption charges brought by the FBI -- just days before its head, Sepp Blatter, stood for reelection.\n\n\"The USA definitely (has) nothing to do with this,\" the Russian President said of FIFA, which is based in Switzerland. \"This is yet another obvious attempt to spread their jurisdiction to other (countries).\"\n\nWhy it matters: FIFA awarded the 2018 World Cup, a coveted event to host, to Russia. It is to be one of Putin's crowning moments in his second term as President.\n\nThere was a lot of pressure on Blatter to prevent the cup from going to Russia, and Putin suggested it's one reason U.S. authorities went after FIFA.\n\nAlso THURSDAY: Declared military deaths secretJUST WATCHEDRussia using mobile crematoriums to burn dead soldiers?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\n\nRussia using mobile crematoriums to burn dead soldiers? 03:00\n\nWhat he did:\n\nFor years, the tally of Russian troops who died at war has been a state secret. Now, President Vladimir Putin says his government won't reveal the number of military deaths during peacetime either -- particularly during special operations.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n\"Not only is this decree a blatant attack on freedom of expression, it also has sinister undertones that will intensify speculation President Putin has something to hide,\" said Amnesty International director John Dalhuisen.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman denied any connection to Ukraine, saying it's just to protect national interests in general.\n\nCNN's Don Melvin, Greg Botelho and Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.",

The latest one is a law signed into effect by Vladimir Putin on Saturday that gives the Russian government the authority to shutter \"undesirable\" organizations. From an Associated Press report on the subject:\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin signed a bill into law Saturday giving prosecutors the power to declare foreign and international organizations \"undesirable\" in Russia and shut them down.\n\n[...]\n\nThe law is part of a Kremlin campaign to stifle dissent that intensified after Putin began his third term in 2012. His return to the presidency had been accompanied by mass street protests that Putin accused the United States of fomenting. Russian suspicions of Western intentions have been further heightened because of tensions over Russia's role in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians tell us that this law is only to protect against groups that threaten the country's constitutional order, defenses, or security, but in the hands of an autocrat like Putin with a history of shutting down dissent, even if it means putting your critics in the morgue, we could easily see it used to close down human rights groups and those protesting Russia's foreign policy. It also could be used against international groups, whether think tanks, rights groups, or other NGOs, working in the country along with Russian activists helping them. Essentially, it give Vladimir Putin the dictatorial power to crackdown on opinions he doesn't like.\n\nWhy am I bringing this to your attention? Alongside Iran and China, Russia is, contrary to President Obama's assertion during a 2012 debate with Mitt Romney, one of our three biggest geopolitical foes at the moment. Actions like this only push the seemingly inevitable clash between Russia and the American-led West closer, and the chief reason Putin is being so bold is that he knows the Obama administration will let him get away with it. Despite her recent troubles, Hillary Clinton is still easily the frontrunner for the Democratic Party's 2016 Presidential nomination, and the issues with Russia are absolutely something we can use against her. After all, it was during her time at the State Department, including the infamous \"Reset Button\" that wasn't, that the Obama administration's policy towards Russia was defined.\n\nAs we approach foreign policy now and as we get closer to 2016, it's actions like this that we need to keep our eyes upon.",
