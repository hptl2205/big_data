                    "body": "The numbers are shocking: at least 1,400 children sexually abused over a 16-year period in an English town of less than 300,000 people. Children \"raped by multiple perpetrators, trafficked ... abducted, beaten and intimidated. There were examples of children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight.\"\n\nThe accusations, laid out in an independent report commissioned by the Rotherham Borough Council and released Tuesday, drew shock across Britain and beyond and led to the immediate resignation of the council's leader, Roger Stone. On Wednesday, pressure was mounting for the police and crime commissioner in South Yorkshire to step down.\n\nThe report charts a history of widespread child sex abuse in Rotherham since 1997. Some incidents took place as recently as last year. Most of the victims are female, but the report's authors note that exploitation of young males remains underreported.\n\nMany of the cases involve the so-called grooming, or manipulation of children, over several years, often with the aid of drugs and alcohol. One anonymous child rape victim in Rotherham, known simply as Emma, told a BBC radio program Wednesday of having developed a relationship with her abusers over several years.\n\n\"After being groomed for quite a while, I started going into Rotherham town center, and I was hanging around with grown men,\" she explained. \"They started introducing alcohol and soft drugs to me. And then, when I was 13, I was sexually exploited by them.\"\n\nEmma said she was raped weekly and that the abuse continued until she was 15. Her family, it's reported, moved her away from the area after authorities ignored her allegations. The report asserts the police \"regarded many child victims with contempt.\"\n\nA South Yorkshire police press officer said the department will be investigating the report's findings and working with its authors. The local borough council and South Yorkshire police face criticism for failing to spot the problem and act sooner.\n\nShaun Wright, the current police and crime commissioner, was in charge of children and young people's services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010, a period in which the abuse took place. Today, his Labor Party called for his resignation. So far he's refused.\n\nThe report states that victims, most said to be white Britons, identified the perpetrators as being of Asian or Pakistani descent, and it notes a reluctance among children's social care workers to draw conclusions about abuse within Rotherham's Asian and Pakistani communities.\n\n\"Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so,\" the report says.\n\nIn 2012, former Justice Minister Jack Straw controversially warned of an \"ethnic dimension\" to the problem of grooming and child sex abuse in Britain in which \"Asian men\" were targeting \"white girls.\"\n\n\"We need to get the Pakistani community to think much more clearly about why this is going on and to be more open about the problems that are leading to a number Pakistani heritage men thinking it's OK to target white girls in this way,\" Straw told the BBC at the time.\n\nThe report in Rotherham comes amid a slew of child sex abuse investigations in Britain over the last two years. They began with the revelation in 2012 that Jimmy Savile, a once-revered British celebrity who had hosted several, long-running music and children's television programs, was suspected of having sexually abused children and adults on a large scale over numerous decades. Savile died in 2011.\n\nBritish musician Cliff Richard was questioned this month by South Yorkshire police on sexual assault allegations that date to 1985.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times contacted several organizations that work with youth groups in the Rotherham area. None returned calls for comment.",

It's horrible. It makes you think 'What happens when you have kids?' You would be scared to let them go out in Rotherham,\" Adbo 21, said.\n\n\"I'm a Muslim and if I saw a Muslim person doing something like that then they would not be a Muslim to me.\n\n\"In Islam we do not teach people to rape and abuse children.\"\n\nThe appalling report has left the South Yorkshire town student shocked, feeling not safe.\n\n\"I find it disgusting. What kind of a town is it if you do not feel safe in your own community?\" asked Sophie Khan, 19.\n\nLast September, a report has warned that pedophile rings of Asian men who groom and sexually exploit children have been targeting Muslims within their own communities as well.\n\nYet, cases of Asian girls, who were victims of sexual abuse, were not \"necessarily\" reported.\n\n\"Pakistani-heritage girls were targeted by taxi drivers and on occasion by older men lying in wait outside school gates,\" Prof Jay found.\n\n\"The women and girls feared reporting such incidents to the police because it would affect their future marriage prospects.\"\n\nBritain is home to a sizable Muslim minority of nearly 2.7 million.\n\nThe majority of the multi-ethnic minority has Indian, Bengali and Pakistani backgrounds.",

If South Yorkshire Police can mount a raid on Sir Cliff Richard's home in pursuit of evidence linked to a single allegation of child sex abuse 30 years ago, why were South Yorkshire Police incapable of pursuing multiple allegations against multiple men who raped 1,400 children over 16 years?\n\nOne thousand four hundred. Consider the weight of that number, feel its tragic heft. Picture 50 junior-school classes of little girls in Rotherham, once a respectable northern town, now a byword for depravity. We have seen child-grooming cases before, but the disgusting stories revealed in the report by Professor Alexis Jay amount to evidence of abuse on an industrial scale.\n\nMen of Pakistani heritage treated white girls like toilet paper. They picked children up from schools and care homes and trafficked them across northern cities for other men to join in the fun. They doused a 15-year-old in petrol and threatened to set her alight should she dare to report them. They menaced entire families and made young girls watch as they raped other children.\n\nThese truly horrible things happened in our country - not in the distant, cruel past, but as recently as last year. All but one of the perpetrators were Muslims of Pakistani heritage who would have related to Cliff's hit, Living Doll.\n\nThe living dolls of Rotherham were bent and twisted to their masters' will. There was no escape. As the sterling Professor Jay observes, South Yorkshire Police \"regarded many child victims with contempt\".\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDenis MacShane: I was too much of a 'liberal leftie' and should have done more to investigate child abuse\n\n27 Aug 2014\n\nPakistanis must condemn the Rotherham abuses\n\n27 Aug 2014\n\n'Nobody at the council needs to resign' claims deputy leader\n\n27 Aug 2014\n\nOne 11-year-old known as Child H told police that she and another girl had been sexually assaulted by grown men. Nothing was done. When she was 12, Child H was found in the back of a taxi with a man who had indecent pictures of her on his phone. Despite the full co-operation of her father, who insisted his daughter was being abused, police failed to act. Four months later, Child H was found in a house alone with a group of Pakistani men. What did the police do? They arrested the child for being drunk and disorderly and ignored her abusers. As President Obama said about the fiends who beheaded the journalist James Foley: \"No just God would stand for what they did.\"\n\nMy, what the British people would give to hear such ringing moral condemnation from our own political leaders.\n\nThe Labour Party, in particular, is mired in shame over \"cultural sensitivity\" in Rotherham. Especially, cynics might point out, a sensitivity to the culture of Muslims whose votes they don't want to lose. Denis MacShane, MP for Rotherham from 1994 to 2012, actually admitted to the BBC's World At One yesterday that \"there was a culture of not wanting to rock the multicultural community boat, if I may put it like that. Perhaps, yes, as a true Guardian reader and liberal Leftie, I suppose I didn't want to raise that too hard.\" Much better to hang on to your impeccable liberal credentials than save a few girls from being raped, eh, Denis?\n\nEqually horrifying is the suggestion that certain Pakistani councillors asked social workers to reveal the addresses of the shelters where some of the abused girls were hiding. The former deputy leader of the council, Jahangir Akhtar, is accused of \"ignoring a politically inconvenient truth\" by insisting there was not a deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls. The inquiry was told that influential Pakistani councillors acted as \"barriers to communication\" on grooming issues.\n\nFront-line youth workers who submitted reports in 2002, 2003 and 2006 expressing their alarm at the scale of the child sex-offending say the town hall told them to keep quiet about the ethnicity of the perpetrators in the interests of \"community cohesion\".\n\nFear of appearing racist trumped fears of more children being abused. Not only were negligent officials not prosecuted, they prospered. Shaun Wright, a former Labour councillor who was in charge of Rotherham children's services during a five-year period when a blind eye was turned to the worst case of mass child abuse in British history, is now South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner. Oh, Jonathan Swift, thou shouldst be writing at this hour!\n\nJane Collins, the Ukip MEP for Yorkshire and Humber, has called for Mr Wright to stand down, a demand that has been echoed by Labour as it realises the full horror of what was done - or not done - by its councillors. \"To cover up something of this scale, it is evil,\" says Mrs Collins.\n\nIt's impossible not to share that incredulous fury. Powerless white working-class girls were caught between a hateful, imported culture of vicious misogyny on the one hand, and on the other a culture of chauvinism among the police, who regarded them as worthless slags. Officials trained up in diversity and political correctness failed to acknowledge what was effectively white slavery on their doorstep. Much too embarrassing to concede that it wasn't white people who were committing racist hate crimes in this instance.\n\nThe whole thing is like a real-life episode of Prime Suspect, in which councillors, the police and child-protection staff collude to give a bunch of sadistic thugs licence to pimp a town's most vulnerable children. As they say in Yorkshire: \"They want shooting, the lot of them.\"\n\nThis will come as no comfort to the 1,400 brutalised girls, many of whom have self-harmed or committed suicide, but I reckon Rotherham may be the final nail in the coffin of multiculturalism. Far from discouraging racism, the Labour policy of withholding the ethnic identity of men who preyed on white girls backfired spectacularly. Criminally, it endangered hundreds of children who might otherwise have been spared. A recent poll showed that 44 per cent of young Britons believe that Muslims do not share the same values as the rest of the population, while 28 per cent said they felt Britain would be \"better off\" with fewer Muslims.\n\nAttitudes are even more negative among older people. A recent Radio 4 item about how junior jihadists spending their gap year massacring people in Iraq could be \"reintegrated\" into British society produced hoots of derision on social media and spilt tea across the breakfast tables of England. (Hands up anyone who wants the blighters back?) The period of giving the benefit of the doubt to young Muslims who go on \"camping holidays\" to Syria is over. Undoubtedly, the fact that \"Jihadi John\", the hooded man who was party to the beheading of James Foley, spoke with a London accent has provoked further despair about the widespread failure of Muslims to integrate. Has it really come to this? A child raised with all the freedoms and blessings of a British upbringing behaving like a natural-born barbarian.\n\nMy colleague Boris Johnson's excellent suggestion that any Britons who travel to Syria and Iraq without informing the authorities should be presumed to be potential terrorists until proven innocent produced howls of outrage from the human rights brigade - but it struck an entire symphony of chords with Britons of all creeds and colours who are sick of being taken for mugs.\n\nThere are other hopeful signs. The Rotherham scandal seems temporarily to have silenced those who insist, every time a child-grooming case is exposed, that most paedophiles are white. Indeed they are; but the Rotherham abusers were not paedophiles. They were men of Pakistani heritage slaking their lust on young girls they regarded as white trash because they knew they could get away with it. It grieves me to say they were right. Like South Yorkshire Police, they treated 1,400 defenceless children \"with contempt\".\n\nOn Channel 4 News on Tuesday, Javed Khan, the chief executive of Barnardo's, refused to give a straight answer to a question about the part that \"ethnicity\" played in the abuse of girls in Rotherham. As the presenter Jackie Long persisted, Mr Khan insisted that we should not be focusing on the identity of the perpetrators because it \"distracted attention\" from the children who were their victims.\n\nOn the contrary. It is of the utmost importance that wider society wakes up to the fact that there is what the inquiry found to be a \"deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls\". Many of us who have been saying this for a long time have been shouted down as racist. Thanks to Prof Jay, it has been stated publicly for the first time that the fear of appearing racist was more pressing in official minds than enforcing the law of the land or rescuing terrified children. It is one of the great scandals of our lifetime.\n\nThe Labour council of Rotherham stands accused of ignoring child sex abuse on an unimaginable scale for 16 years. There can be no more serious charge against a public body. Former councillors who dismissed evidence or otherwise attempted to pervert the course of justice should be arrested. Officers who snubbed appeals from desperate children and their families have no place in our police force.\n\nThus far, a mere five men have been jailed in connection with the disgusting crimes in Rotherham. A further 30 are under investigation. We need a campaign to get other abused children to come forward and receive the appropriate help. We need them to identify the perpetrators. Shame and name, and shame again. Above all, we need those girls to know that what was done to them was criminal, and the way those crimes were ignored and suppressed by powerful men with a political agenda was despicable as well as criminal. To avoid rocking the multicultural boat, they fed 1,400 children to the sharks. No just God would stand for what they did.",

                    "body": "The self-delusion involved in the Rotherham child-abuse case is astonishing. Professor Alexis Jay's report stated that around 1,400 children were sexually abused in the town over 16 years, and that police, social workers and councillors let the victims of these horrific crimes down. Yet the website of Rotherham council introduced her findings this way: \"Services to protect young people at risk from child sexual exploitation in Rotherham are stronger and better co-ordinated across agencies today than ever before, an independent review has found.\" The assertion of improvement is a generous interpretation, to say the least. Prof Jay accepted that services are better, but added that they are over-stretched, long-term victim support is not good enough and, crucially, \"prosecutions remain low in number\".\n\nIt is a vital matter of public safety that we understand precisely what happened in Rotherham and that those responsible for letting it happen are suitably punished. A public inquiry would be entirely appropriate. It could start by asking what precisely went wrong. Why did police ignore some claims of abuse? What was the interaction between social services and the police? Why were reports seen by the council not acted upon? And why was the local Pakistani community not involved in tackling the problem? An examination of how political correctness helped to shield criminals might help stop it from happening in the future.\n\nOne obvious benefit of such questions would be to establish better guidelines on how local authorities ought to deal with abuse. Another would be to examine nationwide failings with the system of social care: very similar problems, covering similar aspects of community relations, have emerged in Rochdale, Derby and Oxford. But a public inquiry will also expose the officials guilty of neglect - and find out if they have moved on to other authorities to spread their incompetence.\n\nPublic servants should not be able to escape this wretched scandal with their livelihoods and reputations intact. All too often it is maddeningly difficult to hold them to account: only one doctor was struck off following the Mid Staffs NHS scandal that revealed poor standards of care - for fraud. If such appalling errors were conducted in the private sector, those responsible would be exposed, sacked and probably face criminal prosecution. There is no reason why such sanctions should not be on the table in Rotherham. After all, in failing to fulfil their professional obligations, these so-called public servants left children to a nightmarish fate. It was a terrible failing that demands a reckoning.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nIn the face of such evil, who is the racist now?\n\n27 Aug 2014\n\nRotherham sex abuse: Theresa May calls for police chief to resign\n\n27 Aug 2014\n\nPakistanis must condemn the Rotherham abuses\n\n27 Aug 2014\n\nRotherham child sex scandal: chiefs who ignored abuse 'must quit'\n\n27 Aug 2014",

                    "body": "Rotherham town hall: A report reveals around 1,400 children were subjected to sexual ...\n\nThe expose of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham this week found that 1,400 children were subjected to appalling abuse over a period of 16 years. The victims identified in the inquiry carried out by Professor Alexis Jay were as young as 11, and the majority were female. The perpetrators were described as being almost exclusively of Pakistani heritage.\n\nWith this development, it is unsurprising that a damning indictment of cover-ups at a senior institutional level and the problem of child exploitation has morphed into issue of race. The report details a combination of factors behind the \"collective failure\" by the police and the local council to stop the abuse - one of which was the fear of being labelled a racist for highlighting the problem, and a mood of denial among prominent councillors.\n\nLeaders of Muslim organisations around the UK have reacted in horror to the case, condemning how the fear of being called a racist allowed the child abuse to remain hidden.\n\nMuhbeen Hussain, founder of British Muslim Youth, commented: \"I'm truly disgusted to see such a report in my home town of Rotherham. The fact these guys were predominantly Pakistani heritage should not be a reason for providing a cloak of invisibility.\"\n\nInstead of focusing on the evidence of \"ignoring a politically inconvenient truth\" and the prevention of such attitudes towards race, others have used the ethnicity of the perpetrators - with some headlines generalising the men as \"Asian\" - to push their personal prejudices. Yet the incident in the small South Yorkshire town is not of racism, but one of misogyny.\n\nWomen and girls make up around 95% of victims of sexual exploitation around the world. It is widely viewed as part of the spectrum of male violence against women and children - which includes rape, sexual harassment and domestic abuse. The fact that the vast majority of the victims in Rotherham were female is evidence of these heinous statistics - and the role that misogyny plays in the sexual exploitation of children.\n\nSpeaking to IBTimes UK, Andrea Matolcsi, the programme officer for trafficking for charity Equality Now, said that persistent gender inequalities allow the modern-day slavery of children to continue in Britain.\n\n\"Perpetrators exploit victims because they feel they feel victims are 'lesser' than them,\" she explained. \"The specific inequality between women and men also means that it is possible to sexualise and objectify, and thus treat women and girls as objects that can be bought, sold, rented and abused.\"\n\nThese inequalities are engrained in a culture of undervaluing women and girls, but it is not a problem mutually exclusive to ethnic minority communities. Grooming is an issue universal to all women - but it is not one that affects all men of Pakistani origin.\n\nSara Khan, of the human rights group for British Muslim women Inspire, explained that those who sexually exploit children and women have a poor opinion of all females: \"As a Bradford-born and raised Muslim woman from the Kashmiri/Mirpuri community, I understand the cultural complexities.

                    "body": "Rotherham town hall: A report revealed around 1,400 children were subjected to sexual exploitation(Wiki Commons)\n\nThe expose of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham this week found that 1,400 children were subjected to appalling abuse over a period of 16 years. The victims identified in the inquiry carried out by Professor Alexis Jay were as young as 11, and the majority were female. The perpetrators were described as being almost exclusively of Pakistani heritage.\n\nWith this development, it is unsurprising that a damning indictment of cover-ups at a senior institutional level and the problem of child exploitation has morphed into issue of race. The report details a combination of factors behind the \"collective failure\" by the police and the local council to stop the abuse - one of which was the fear of being labelled a racist for highlighting the problem, and a mood of denial among prominent councillors.\n\nLeaders of Muslim organisations around the UK have reacted in horror to the case, condemning how the fear of being called a racist allowed the child abuse to remain hidden.\n\nMuhbeen Hussain, founder of British Muslim Youth, commented: \"I'm truly disgusted to see such a report in my home town of Rotherham. The fact these guys were predominantly Pakistani heritage should not be a reason for providing a cloak of invisibility.\"\n\nInstead of focusing on the evidence of \"ignoring a politically inconvenient truth\" and the prevention of such attitudes towards race, others have used the ethnicity of the perpetrators - with some headlines generalising the men as \"Asian\" - to push their personal prejudices. Yet the incident in the small South Yorkshire town is not of racism, but one of misogyny.\n\nWomen and girls make up around 95% of victims of sexual exploitation around the world. It is widely viewed as part of the spectrum of male violence against women and children - which includes rape, sexual harassment and domestic abuse. The fact that the vast majority of the victims in Rotherham were female is evidence of these heinous statistics - and the role that misogyny plays in the sexual exploitation of children.\n\nSpeaking to IBTimes UK, Andrea Matolcsi, the programme officer for trafficking for charity Equality Now, said that persistent gender inequalities allow the modern-day slavery of children to continue in Britain.\n\n\"Perpetrators exploit victims because they feel they feel victims are 'lesser' than them,\" she explained. \"The specific inequality between women and men also means that it is possible to sexualise and objectify, and thus treat women and girls as objects that can be bought, sold, rented and abused.\"\n\nThese inequalities are engrained in a culture of undervaluing women and girls, but it is not a problem mutually exclusive to ethnic minority communities. Grooming is an issue universal to all women - but it is not one that affects all men of Pakistani origin.\n\nRotherham grooming gang (Clockwise from top left) Mohsin Khan, 21, Razwan Razaq, 30, Adil Hussain, 20, Zafran Ramzan, 21, Umar Razaq, 24\n\nSara Khan, of the human rights group for British Muslim women Inspire, explained that those who sexually exploit children and women have a poor opinion of all females: \"As a Bradford-born and raised Muslim woman from the Kashmiri/Mirpuri community, I understand the cultural complexities. Let's be clear: it's not just white women that are viewed as inferior - many from these Pakistani rural villages believe all women are second class citizens.\"\n\n\"The cultural of conservative communities has at its root a deep-seated misogyny with the aim of controlling every aspect of a woman's life and reducing her into subservience,\" she added.\n\nWhile racists have further ammunition after the Rotherham report, it would be more productive to highlight the underlying issue.

Some officials appeared to believe that social workers pointing to a pattern of sexual exploitation were exaggerating, while others reportedly worried about being accused of racism if they spoke out. The report accused officials of ignoring \"a politically inconvenient truth\" in turning a blind eye to men of Pakistani heritage grooming vulnerable white girls for sex.\n\nMore:\n\nSome officials were apparently ordered by their managers to withhold information on the ethnic origin of the abusers, the report said. As a result, no contact was made with local Pakistani leaders for help in identifying gangs that continued to assault and abduct teenagers.\n\nIt beggars belief how sick and corrupt so many English people have become. My God, you let men rape and torture your daughters, but don't dare say anything because somebody, somewhere, might call you a racist, or a fellow traveler with the BNP?\n\nThe Guardian writes:\n\nCouncil and other officials sometimes thought youth workers were exaggerating the exploitation problem. Sometimes they were afraid of being accused of racism if they talked openly about the perpetrators in the town mostly being Pakistani taxi drivers.\n\nMore:\n\nJahangir Akhtar, the former deputy leader of the council, is accused in the report of naivety and potentially \"ignoring a politically inconvenient truth\" by insisting there was not a deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls. Police told the inquiry that some influential Pakistani councillors in Rotherham acted as barriers to communication on grooming issues.\n\nAnd:\n\nA mortgage adviser who drove a BMW and owned several properties promised to treat a 13-year old \"like a princess\". Another man pulled the hair of a 13-year old and called her a \"white bitch\" when she tried to reject his attempt to strip her.\n\nStraight-up, violent, sexist racism. But the Rotherham police and politicians turned a blind eye.\n\nIt's not only reverse-racist political correctness at fault. If you read the entire report, you see a bureaucracy rife with dysfunction. A crude, sexist, macho culture within the police force is partially to blame. Disgusting men.\n\nOver 1,400 female children treated like animals, by animals. And aside from the Council leader who voluntarily resigned yesterday, not one of the people responsible for this moral outrage will be punished. Not one.\n\nEd West at The Spectator nails it:\n\n'I didn't want to appear racist' is truly the 'I was only obeying orders' of our time.\n\n... Political correctness was supposed to make us nicer, but in reality it just makes people stupider. As anyone who has done any sort of online test will tell you, much of human intelligence comes down to pattern recognition; the whole purpose of political correctness is to stop us noticing patterns even when they stare us in the face.\n\nBritish progressives, let's not hear another word about how the sacrosanct nature of the Catholic Church contributed to the sexual exploitation of children by priests until you face up to the fact that the values of political correctness on the matter of race and ethnicity contributed to the sexual exploitation of children by these Pakistanis. Catholicism doesn't \"cause\" clerical sexual abuse any more than anti-racism \"causes\" Pakistanis sex gangs to rape children. But a big part of the meaning of Rotherham is that Rotherham authorities were willing to sacrifice the humanity of at least 1,400 little girls to the god of political correctness.\n\nAnd you watch: some progressives are even now worrying more about people thinking the Wrong Thing about Pakistani men than they are about these children, their rapists, the potential anti-white race hatred of the children's rapists, and how the authorities failed those children.",

                    "body": "Nothing should stand in the way of protecting the vulnerable. Those who fail should take responsibility\n\nShaun Wright, Labour's South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, who was Rotherham's cabinet member for children and young people's services from 2005 until 2010, is refusing to resign. He apologises unreservedly for the grotesque abuse that 1,400 children or more may have endured on his watch, but he says the scale of the abuse has come as a surprise to him. The chorus of voices raised against him, which includes the leadership of his own party, is, rightly, swelling. He should have gone at once. His lack of leadership, his reluctance to ask difficult questions or to intervene proactively, allowed the exploitation itemised in Professor Alexis Jay's grim report on Tuesday to grow from what an earlier investigator called gang abuse for personal gratification into \"financial and career opportunities\" for young, mainly Asian, men. His failure to take responsibility now, in the face of the evidence, suggests a dangerous reluctance to address what went so damagingly wrong for so many vulnerable young women. No wonder some of them have now launched a class action against the council.\n\nRotherham is not alone in experiencing colossal institutional failure in child protection. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and a pattern of abuse that has now resulted in convictions in towns from Torbay to Rochdale is very likely to be happening in other places not yet identified. But its experience should offer at least a checklist for behaviour that should trigger alarm. In particular, councils should examine just how - in the words of the Office of the Children's Commissioner - they see and hear children who may be in trouble. As so often, many of those in Rotherham who should have been on the victims' side saw these vulnerable children as authors of their own misfortunes and failed, cruelly, to listen to their accounts. Then there was a misguided reluctance to consider whether there was an issue of race involved. Finally, they lacked any kind of institutional data-sharing that might have allowed police, schools, hospitals and social workers to understand what was happening.\n\nThe question of ethnicity is particularly contentious. Rotherham is a very white, poor, working-class town with a growing but still small - less than 10% - black and minority ethnic population of which less than a third is Muslim. In last May's local elections, Ukip won most votes and became the official opposition on the council. A march by the English Defence League during the campaign drew 500 supporters. On Tuesday, one of the first on Twitter with a gloating tweet was Nick Griffin of the BNP. In that context it is understandable that the Labour council was sensitive to the reputation of its Muslim community. But it led to a terrible misjudgment: the subordination of the safeguarding of abused and exploited children - who were mainly, but not only, white - to the protection of the standing of one particular community. When the then Labour MP Ann Cryer, the anti-forced-marriage campaigner, began reporting accounts of young Pakistani-heritage men hanging about school gates in 2003, she was bitterly criticised. So, more recently, was the Times reporter Andrew Norfolk, whose painstaking investigation has done so much to bring the exploitation to light. Ethnicity did play a part in the Rotherham abuse, not because this particular pattern of abuse is restricted to a particular group (the behaviour is typical of many gangs) but because many of those who might have taken action feared the wider, societal, consequences if they did.\n\nLike all sexual abuse, this was an example of the exploitation of the weak, and it is teaching some hard lessons. The CPS recognises that prosecutions can go ahead even when victims give confused accounts of abuse, reported long after the event. The value of gathering and sharing data between agencies is now widely understood. But the clearest lesson is that nothing, at all, must come before the need to protect the vulnerable, and those who fail must be held to account.",

There were examples of children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, threatened with guns, made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone.\n\n\"Girls as young as 11 were raped by large numbers of male perpetrators.\"\n\nProf Jay is adamant that such abuse is not a dark chapter safely in the past. Her report states it \"continues to this day\".\n\nHelen Mary Jones, chief executive of Youth Cymru, was alarmed that evidence that abuse was taking place was not acted upon.\n\nShe said: \"It's not as if there were no reports made about this. It's not as if families and children weren't trying to get authorities [to act].\n\n\"We need to be vigilant and make sure that's not happening in Wales.\"\n\nIn particular, she wants to be sure that authorities will not shy away from taking action because a young person's behaviour is deemed a \"lifestyle choice\".\n\nShe said: \"I'd like to think that's ancient history in Wales... We have to take a long look and make sure we are providing the right kind of training and support.\"\n\nMs Jones added: \"We have the age of consent at 16 for good reason. That person is not an adult - that's a young person who's being abused.\"\n\nLynne Hill of the charity Children in Wales had similar concerns, stressing the need for children to be seen as children - regardless of how confident or even hostile they may appear.\n\nShe said: \"We always need to remember they are still children and young people. That is one of the key things.\"\n\nMs Hill wants to see changes as a result of the report, saying: \"It's very important that when these situations come to light that people providing services for children and young people [really] do learn the lessons and take them on board.\"\n\nThe report describes how on two occasions fathers \"tracked down their daughters and tried to remove them from houses where they were being abused\" but were arrested when police were called to the scene. In other cases, victims were arrested for being drunk and disorderly but no action was taken against the rapists.\n\nHard questions must be asked as to how presumably intelligent individuals in different bodies failed to get a grip on an epidemic of abuse. Did a lack of training stop people seeing the atrocities taking place in front of them, or was there a blatant refusal to acknowledge the horror in their midst?\n\nThe ethnicity of the perpetrators clearly complicated the response.\n\nAccording to the report: \"By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away.\n\n\"Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.\"\n\nRotherham faced a nightmare scenario of a child abuse crisis that could not be tackled without addressing the behaviour of individuals from an ethnic group. The potential for damaging headlines and political fall-out was clear.\n\nBut the failure to adopt a frank, honest, transparent and urgent response led to suffering continuing for years. People in highly paid leadership roles failed to live up to their responsibilities and lives were wrecked as a consequence.\n\nAmong the many morals to emerge from this saga is the need for designated leaders to lead with courage and integrity, even if this results in negative publicity that makes it harder to attract investment and tourists. Failure to act will only result in even more devastating scandals.\n\nIf people do not want to have to take tough decisions, risk controversy and defend their actions they should not stand for election or apply to join the police or work in such sensitive areas.\n\nToday, Rotherham is synonymous with a devastating story of incompetence and hard-heartedness. Demands for managers who neglected their responsibilities to be held to account will only intensify as the UK wakes up to the extent of the barbarism that was committed with apparent impunity for so long.\n\nThe victims will need support in the years ahead as they struggle to come to terms with the evil they have experienced. Mere apologies will not heal the continuing pain.\n\nThe anguish endured by these people who were manipulated, abused and raped requires that real reform - not just well-crafted words - emerges as a result of this week's report. A refusal to learn lessons would be yet another insult to those who have suffered so much.\n\nJust as we shake our heads and ask how shamed celebrities got away with abusive behaviour for decades, it is just as frightening to ask how institutions charged with defending the vulnerable failed to save Rotherham's children in their hour of need.",

If the people charged with protecting vulnerable children notice this pattern then they should not only be free to look into it, but they should feel a duty to do so, and to raise the point in public.

It's not about racism, it's about welfare.\n\n'Unfortunately the people involved in this worried about being called racist. We have to face up to that fact and tackle this head-on in the community.'\n\nProfessor Alexis Jay, author of the council-commissioned report, highlighted political correctness as a key factor in the long-running scandal.\n\nShe warned police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist.\n\nConcerns about damage to community cohesion were put above the need to protect the vulnerable, the report said.\n\nReaders took to social media in anger accusing the Corporation of sanitising its online coverage.\n\nReference was made to Pakistani men in the BBC's evening news broadcasts and this morning's radio.\n\nHowever, the lead articles online this morning simply referred to the perpetrators as 'criminal gangs'.\n\nOne commenter tweeted: 'BBC unable to even say \"Pakistani\" & point fingers. If your name is Cliff Richard however, they'll send a TV helicopter. #rotherham'.\n\nAnother said: 'The reference to perpetrators being virtually all Pakistani has been removed from the BBC piece #Rotherham'.\n\nAnd one wrote: 'Main BBC News website story on #Rotherham does not mention Asian/Pakistani once, they are \"criminal gangs\"'.\n\nThe report stated: 'The issue of race, regardless of ethic group, should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is known to be a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised abuse in any local community.'\n\nCouncil staff were given 'clear directions' from managers to downplay the 'ethnic dimension' of the abuse despite almost all the perpetrators being of Pakistani heritage.\n\nThree separate reports warning of the scale of the abuse were 'suppressed or ignored' by the council because it was 'in denial' about the crimes.\n\nDespite the appalling failures in the case, no one in authority has been sacked or even disciplined. MPs and charities said the scale of the abuse was almost 'incomprehensible' and called for a criminal investigation into those who helped cover it up.\n\nAnd at least six victims have now launched a class action against Rotherham council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion we've sanitised our reporting is nonsense.\n\n'Our coverage on BBC News, including online, has made it clear that the abusers were predominately Asian and that council staff feared being labelled racist.\n\n'Stories on the website are constantly evolving but all have clear links to articles which explain the full context.\n\n'We spoke to members of the Pakistani community in Rotherham on Today, BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC News Channel and more reaction is expected online later.",

One senior officer suggested that some influential Pakistani-heritage councillors in Rotherham had acted as barriers.\"\n\nIt found that although \"by far the majority\" of perpetrators were described as Asian by victims,throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue.\n\nResponding to the findings, Children's Commissioner Maggie Atkinson told BBC Radio 4 that the lack of contact with an ethnic community was problematic in itself: \"It's actually racist to think you know what they are feeling and how they'll behave.\"\n\nIn 2006 a report by Dr Angie Heal on violence and gun crime and its links with sexual exploitation and prostitution in South Yorkshire, found that \"a number of workers in the town involved with the issue believed that one of the difficulties which prevented CSE being dealt with effectively was the ethnicity of the perpetrators\".",

                    "body": "The Rotherham abuse scandal represents a savage indictment of the local council and police. Through their spectacular incompetence, cowardice and neglect they allowed more than 1,400 vulnerable girls, some as young as 11, to be systematically abused over a period of 16 years, even though many of these victims were known to the authorities.\n\nIt seems almost inexplicable that abuse on this scale could be allowed to happen.\n\nYet in some ways the appalling saga in the South Yorkshire town was all too predictable, for it was a direct consequence of the creed of multiculturalism that holds sway across the public sector, particularly the social services.\n\nIt is this enforced orthodoxy that so disastrously inhibited the Rotherham authorities from taking action against the predatory gangs of Pakistani men, and from protecting the girls, who were mainly white.\n\nFailure\n\nThe ideologues of multiculturalism, clinging to their vision of harmonious diversity, might not like to face up to the reality, but without doubt the ethnicity of the abusers was a central factor in the reluctance of the State to tackle their vile activities. The report produced by Professor Alexis Jay, the distinguished former inspector of social work in Scotland, makes that unequivocally clear.\n\n'Almost all' offenders were Pakistani, she writes, 'yet some people in the council and the police wanted to play down the ethnic dimension.'\n\nMeanwhile, frontline staff felt 'unsure' how to deal with the crime pattern 'for fear of being thought racist'.\n\nShamefully, it is obvious from the report that the council and police put far greater emphasis on maintaining the image of successful diversity in Rotherham than on protecting children.\n\nProfessor Jay's report states explicitly that gangs acted with impunity for 16 years because council staff not only feared accusations of racism but thought a tough approach 'might damage community cohesion'.\n\nEven Denis MacShane, the disgraced former Labour MP for Rotherham, who was jailed for fiddling his expenses, admitted yesterday that in his role as a constituency representative he failed to take the allegations seriously because 'I didn't want to rock the multicultural boat'.\n\nThose words, along with Professor Jay's report, show the terrible damage done by the ideology of multiculturalism which, in Rotherham, was elevated above the requirements of law enforcement and compassionate morality.\n\nIts supporters proclaim multiculturalism as a vehicle for prosperity, vibrancy and harmony. But in truth, as we can see from the fragmentation of our urban areas, it has promoted division, separatism and distrust.\n\nThanks to this dogma, we no longer have a universal moral code or national identity, and the consequences can be seen all around us, whether in the rise of home-grown Islamic extremism or in the failure of too many migrant groups to learn even basic English.\n\nThe advance of multiculturalism across our civic life has been fuelled by the deepening official fixation with 'anti-racism'.\n\nI should stress that the fight against genuine racial prejudice is a noble cause, one that inspired the civil rights activists in Sixties America and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. In Britain, too, an eagerness to root out bigotry helped to create an open, inclusive society that was welcoming to immigrants.\n\nIn the same way, the uplifting moral imperative of rejecting racism helped ultimately to achieve justice for the family of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.\n\nBut since the successful outcome of the Lawrence case, I am worried that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of hysterical, authoritarian anti-racism -- a fear that any criticism of a particular racial, cultural or religious group will be seen as racist.\n\nThe police, accused of 'institutional racism' in the 1999 report of the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence, now appear to be sometimes paralysed in the face of criminality by ethnic minorities, an attitude reflected in their obsession with community engagement and diversity awareness training.\n\nIndeed, Professor Jay criticised the police in Rotherham for their excessive reliance on the views of Muslim elders, an approach that undermined the protection of women and girls.\n\nSome will argue that such fears arise from well-meaning impulses. Yet our political Establishment seems to have lost the sense that a balance must be struck between the admirable battle against real discrimination and the craven fear of challenging even the worst kinds of behaviour among some ethnic minorities.\n\nThe latter is what we see all the time in modern urban Britain, where the obsession with diversity reigns supreme. The horrors of Rotherham are hardly unique. We have seen the same official reluctance to tackle abuse by predatory Muslim gangs in places such as Oxford, Telford, Derby and Rochdale.\n\nBlighted\n\nIn the same pusillanimous manner, the police and councils have been fearful of tackling the rise of jihadism on our streets, pretending that there was no real threat to Britain.\n\nIndeed, in one notorious case, West Midlands police urged the prosecution of Channel 4 TV producers on grounds of incitement to racial hatred, for daring to make a documentary about hate preachers in Birmingham's mosques.\n\nThis neurosis about anti-discrimination has also blighted the State's ability to deal with gangland violence, gun crime, muggings and knife attacks perpetrated by young black men in our inner cities, a supine posture that plumbed new depths in 2011 in the riots that engulfed London after the shooting of the alleged drug dealer Mark Duggan.\n\nIt was the police's fear of accusations of racism, bred by years of unbalanced anti-racist indoctrination, that allowed disorder to spread so rapidly across the capital. At the same time, there was a litany of excuse-making to absolve the young criminals of responsibility for their actions.\n\nWe are told that they are suffering from deprivation, marginalisation, a macho street culture and a lack of male role models, though any attempt to address these problems often leads to yet more charges of racism.\n\nTolerant\n\nThe remorseless official focus on anti-racism has been further fed by the dramatic transformation of our society through mass immigration, which over the past decade has been running at more than 500,000 new arrivals every year, with many arriving from Asia and Africa.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to describe the change as an unprecedented social revolution. White British people are in the minority across entire conurbations such as London, Luton and Slough.\n\nFor all the cheering from the multiculturalists at this demographic upheaval, we have to recognise that it has not only imposed a severe burden on our civic infrastructure, reflected in overcrowded schools and overstretched hospitals, but has led to a host of other problems including the importing of dangerous diseases such as tuberculosis and rickets, formerly thought to have been eradicated from modern Britain.\n\nAs I know from my own experience, this country has been wonderfully tolerant. Few other nations could have absorbed so many newcomers without strife or political breakdown. But that tolerance is being stretched to breaking point.",
