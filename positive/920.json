                    "body": "Director Peter Jackson has revealed a safety video for Air New Zealand which features a look into Middle Earth and many actors from The Hobbit trilogy.\n\nWhile we've been hearing about this safety video featuring Lord of the Rings and Hobbit director Peter Jackson for quite some time, the Air New Zealand video has finally arrived. Watch below where director Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, and a few more Hobbit characters show up:\n\nAir New Zealand decided to take advantage of the final Hobbit film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, and release a new safety video for their airline which features their beloved director Sir Peter Jackson.\n\nIt's certainly a bit bizarre, but we get to see two passengers as they take a look at all things Middle Earth after taking a seat on one of Air New Zealand's planes. Elijah Wood is seen sitting near the two Hobbit fans (who are dressed in their Hobbit gear) and we also get a look at a few dwarves from the film.\n\nWe also get a look at Weta Digital's Richard Taylor, who is shown sitting in a seat looking fairly tiny next to an orc. We also get a look at Dean O'Gorman as the dwarf Fili, while he rides a horse and shows passengers how to buckle and unbuckle their seatbelt.\n\nIt's nice that Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood were willing to make this fun video for Air New Zealand passengers and we imagine everyone will take a bit more notice when the safety video rolls before their flight to and from the beautiful country of New Zealand.\n\nThe studio have also released a new poster for The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, which finally features the entire cast. Check it out below:\n\nLet us know if you plan on taking the journey to see the real Hobbiton in the future in New Zealand. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies will be released on December 17.",

Starring Elijah Wood and Sir Peter Jackson; we're thrilled to unveil The Most Epic Safety Video Ever Made.\n\nOne does not simply fly to Middle Earth. One pays heed as an elfin flight attendant guides one through Air New Zealand's \"Most Epic Safety Video Ever Made.\"\n\nAs \"the official airline of Middle Earth,\" Air New Zealand is celebrating the upcoming release of the third Hobbit movie with their own in-flight safety video featuring Lord of the Rings heavyweights Elijah Wood, Richard Taylor, Sylvester McCoy, and Peter Jackson.\n\n\"Cease your rabble rousing and listen very carefully and obey all crew member instructions and all illuminated signs,\" the pointy-eared cabin crew member says with a smile at the beginning of the video. And passengers - like the LOTR fans in the video who can't help themselves when they are seated by Frodo - probably can't help but pay attention as an orc displays the proper oxygen-mask technique.\n\nThe video is four and a half minutes of Tolkeinesque fantasy covering all the essentials of routine airline safety. A wizard aboard a giant eagle demonstrates the crash position. While leading the charge in a battle scene, Jackson reminds passengers to stow all electronic devices. There are even tiny life jackets for Hobbits (or children). And of course Frodo is in the Shire to offer to passenger-fans: \"May your path always be guided by the light of the stars and may the future bestow upon you all the happiness and adventure our Middle Earth has to offer.\"\n\nAir New Zealand, which has been taking the series's fans to where the movies have been filmed for about a decade, previously pulled together a Middle Earth-themed safety video in 2012.\n\nThe final film of Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, titled, \"The Battle of the Five Armies,\" is set to be released in the US on December 17. New Zealanders will get to see it six days earlier, on December 11.",

Previous efforts starred the All Blacks, Bear Grylls and Snoop Dogg - with an earlier Hobbit safety video ('An Unexpected Briefing') gaining over 12 million views on YouTube.\n\nThis time, \"the most epic safety video ever made\" features several castmembers from Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, including Elijah Wood, Dean O'Gorman and Sylvester McCoy.\n\n\"If you have half-lings or young ones, secure your own [oxygen] mask before helping with theirs,\" the video instructs.\n\nIt was shot over several days in locations recognisable from the trilogy - including Hamilton and Central Otago. Weta Workshop and Weta Digital, which provide costumes and visual effects for the Lord of the Rings movies, were also involved.\n\nNot all Air New Zealand videos receive such glowing reviews. Earlier this year, a controversial effort featuring swimwear models saw the airline accused of sexism.\n\nThe third and final film in trilogy, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, will be released this December.\n\n\"May your path always be guided by the light of the stars,\" Wood signs off.\n\nGoing to press, the new video had chalked up several million views.",

With only two months to go until the The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies brings both the Hobbit trilogy and Peter Jackson's entire Middle-earth saga to a close, Air New Zealand has unveiled a sweeping four-minute tutorial that's tricked out with battle sequences, resplendent costumes, and fan-friendly cameos. (Hey there Elijah!)\n\nContent-wise, the video doesn't teach you anything you (hopefully) don't already know about how to make it through a long-haul international flight: fasten your seat belts, secure your own oxygen mask before helping a young person, assume crash positions if absolutely necessary. (Here, of course, these instructions are provided by an Elf.) Unlike Air New Zealand's previous Middle-earth-themed clip, this new one also provides a handy pre-landing travelogue of New Zealand's gorgeous landscapes, as well as a guide to all the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings merchandise you can buy in just about any store. And those sales might come in handy: The Guardian estimates The Hobbit franchise cost a whopping $943 million in local dollars (close to $750 million in U.S. currency). No word on how much Air New Zealand spent on this video, but here's hoping they didn't have to hock any golden rings.",

Well, at least until Peter Jackson gets desperate and turns The Silmarillion or The Children of H\u00farin into their own trilogies, which we expect to happen in the next year or two. Anyway, New Zealand -- being the country where Jackson has filmed his J.R.R. Tolkien adaptations -- isn't ready to let the movies go just yet. After all, there are countless nerds out there who would love an opportunity to take pilgrimages to the magical land of New Zealand so they can see the lovely green fields of Rohan, the breathtaking cliffs of the Misty Mountains, and the beautiful black tower of Barad-d\u00fbr -- home to Sauron, the Dark Lord Of New Zealand.\n\nNow, with all of these people taking Hobbit-related vacations, Air New Zealand has decided to release an instructional video that presents airplane safety in a way that's not only more relatable for the modern Tolkien fan, but just as exciting as the most thrilling battle in any movie. Well, that's what Air New Zealand is hoping they'll think, at least. Dubbed \"The Most Epic Safety Video Ever Made,\" it shows various people in Lord Of The Rings costumes -- some of them Lord Of The Rings actors -- talking about the proper way to put on a seatbelt or an oxygen mask. It's all very knowingly silly, but Air New Zealand seems to have put in a good amount of work actually turning the video into its own kind of advertisement for the fabulous sights of its country. There's even a climactic battle of cheerful greetings and friendly hugs, just like in the movies. Also, Air New Zealand did a similar Hobbit-themed video in 2012, but this one is a bit more entertaining.",

And that pride is totally justified, because it's one of the most gorgeous places I've ever seen... on a movie/TV/computer screen. Sadly I've never seen it in real life, but thanks to clever things like this new Hobbit-themed safety video from Air New Zealand, I just keep moving it higher and higher up on my bucket list.\n\nThis isn't the first time the airline has paid tribute to Peter Jackson's movies in their safety videos, and it probably won't be the last. I certainly hope it won't be the last, because the \"Most Epic Safety Video Ever Made\" really lives up to its name. There are sweeping landscape shots, amazing creatures, and plenty of movie references. There's even a huge battle scene with a bunch of extras in costume. (But then they all end up being friends and hug it out.) The video is also really great to listen to, because Kiwis have amazing accents.\n\nAnd there are cameos too! Elijah Wood (aka Frodo) is there to glance nervously at a couple of starstruck plane passengers and then return to Bag End (I'm not crying, you're crying!), Dean O'Gorman (aka Fili the dwarf) is riding a horse in shots stolen directly from my dreams, Sylvester McCoy (aka Radagast the Brown) is also there sporting some fashionable bird poop. And you know I'm a geek because I also recognized Richard Taylor, head of Weta Workshop. Of course Peter Jackson is there as well, telling people to turn off their damn phones. I have to leave now, because I need to go somewhere private and scream over how awesome this is. Enjoy the video while I have my freakout!",

Sean Astin is nowhere to be found.\n\nAir New Zealand has a pretty solid track record in the quirky-safety-videos realm, with past viral entries usually featuring either an odd celebrity appearance or simply a heavy dose of weirdness, but this one is particularly entertaining. I hesitate calling it epic, as they do, because The Iliad this is not. It's still a safety video, and not to pick nits, but that wannabe Gandalf can't carry Sir Ian McKellen's staff. That said, it's still absurdly ambitious for a safety video and one of the more creative advertisements I've seen recently. At the very least, even the most casual of Tolkien fans should get a kick out of seeing Middle Earth in all (OK, some of) its fantastic glory once again -- quirky four-minute safety video or no.",

While the reality is less Patton-esque, designing and creating the 45-minute fight at the climax of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is much like preparing\n\nfor an actual full-scale assault. \"There's a lot of logistics that have to be thought through,\" says Jackson. \"We have dwarves and men and elves and orcs, all with different cultures, with different weapons, and different shields and patterns and tactics.\"\n\nThe mega-melee takes place at the foot of the Lonely Mountain as various armies vie for the newly reacquired dwarven treasure of Erebor. Like so much in Jackson's Middle-earth, it represents filmmaking on the largest possible scale. \"Before we could loose the first arrow, we had to design the landscape itself and figure out, 'Okay, if we have 10,000 orcs, how much room are they going to take up?'\u2009\" Jackson says. \"\u2009'Are they going to fill up the valley or look like a speck?' Then we could start drawing the arrows on the schematics.\"\n\nYou'll notice that some of those arrows are labeled \"EAGLES.\" Indeed, the gargantuan birds of prey that helped save the day in both the final Lord of the Rings film and the first Hobbit will return, this time led by the never-before-CGI rendered Lord of the Eagles. (No, it's not Don Henley.) Jackson acknowledges that the creatures have a habit of being a bit of a deus ex machina, something he tried to avoid this time around. \"Tolkien uses eagles in a way that can be kind of awkward because they tend to show up out of the blue and change things pretty quickly,\" says the director. \"So here they're just part of the plan, not the saviors. I mean, I do realize that if the eagles had just been able to bring Frodo to Mount Doom in Lord of the Rings and let him drop the ring in, those movies would have been much shorter.\"\n\nAfter making the Lord of the Rings trilogy and two previous Hobbit films, Jackson has learned that epic warfare can be surprisingly boring, especially if you're not watching people you care about. \"We have a rule that we're not allowed to go more than two or three shots of anonymous people fighting without cutting back to our principal characters,\" he says. \"Otherwise the audience just ends up with battle fatigue.\"",

Lucy might have to share the spotlight with the Hobbit, though, if the theory is proven to be correct.\n\nA quick refresher: The Hobbit Human, aka Homo floresiensis, was a 3 1/2 foot tall species with huge feet that lived on the remote Indonesian island as early as 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe prevailing theory has been that the Hobbit was a member of our family tree, belonging to the genus Homo and having descended from a population of Homo erectus that made its way to the island and shrunk in stature over evolutionary time due to the \"island effect.\" (Because islands are relatively closed communities, evolution tends to lead to smaller forms.) Remains for a handful of Hobbits were found with stone tools and bones of a pygmy form of the now-extinct, elephant-like Stegodon.\n\nRenowned paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer from the Natural History Museum in London questioned some parts of this theory.",

That's yesterday's verdict from the US edition of the international entertainment newspaper Variety, in an article about the prolific output of Wellington's Weta Workshop.\n\nVariety's Tim Gray reports:\n\nRichard Taylor, who runs Weta Workshop with his wife, Tania Rodger, believes in creative diversity. He has won Oscars in three categories: two for makeup, two in visual effects and one for costume design. It reflects his philosophy, \"We can only survive if we innovate every day.\"\n\nThe company built 48,000 individual items (props, costumes, etc.) for \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. For the \"Hobbit\" trio, the team produced 11,862 prosthetics, with 5,493 of these just for the Dwarves.\n\nGray writes that the Weta offices in Miramar seem like a labyrinth.\n\nDuring Variety's visit, WW staffers were working on museum installations, a sculpture garden, film projects and books (designed and written inhouse, with 16 published so far). Conducting Variety on a tour through the multi-level maze of workshops, Taylor introduces each space matter-of-factly: \"This is the sword-grinding room; this is the sculpting department; this is the paint department,\" and he points out machines that do robotic 3D milling, printing, laser-cutting, plasma-cutting and foam latex, urethane casting and riveting machines. \"We built machines that can build components,\" he says simply.\n\nAnd he says that Richard Taylor promotes the \"Jack and Jill of all trades\" mentality.",

It is twice the size of the original, at 400 square metres, and can cater for groups of up to 50.\n\nIt will also allow tours to be tailored for visiting groups. For example, you could have a two-hour tour including a hands-on demonstration, whereas the Weta Cave tour lasts 45 minutes.\n\nA contract has already been agreed with one of the big backpackers' bus companies that includes passengers making fake Orc blood, which they can take away with them in a vial.\n\nThe idea for the new premises was hatched earlier this year, with the coming cruise ship season in mind.\n\n\"We realised we had to do something to improve the quality of the experience for the cruise passengers and improve the capacity issues and congestion issues [at the original cave],\" Weta Workshop general manager David Wilks said.\n\nThe new cave has been fitted out in just four weeks at a cost of between $100,000 and $200,000. The first of the cruise ship tours, which are traditionally short on time but large in size, went through on Monday.\n\n\"The key thing for us is not wanting to push volume through, it's about making sure we can focus on providing a good experience,\" Wilks said.\n\n\"We weren't doing a particularly good job for the cruise market and what they needed.\"\n\nWeta head of tourism Jake Downing said the Weta Cave was already on the shore excursion programme for a lot of cruise ships, as part of a Lord of the Rings location tour. \"We've also been talking to one of the ships' agents to see if they can include us as a product as well.\"\n\nThe smaller Weta Cave, which has been handling between 50,000 and 60,000 visitors a year, will remain open for smaller groups and individuals.\n\nA standard tour of the new Weta Experience costs the same as the Weta Cave: adults $24, children $12 (under-5s free), and a family pass at $60.",

Tolkien abordan un vuelo y son transportados al universo del escritor ingl\u00e9s, donde todas las instrucciones de seguridad son mostradas por actores y empleados de la aerol\u00ednea.\n\nEn el video, que dura cuatro minutos y medio, participan algunos de los rostros m\u00e1s conocidos de El Hobbit, como el protagonista de la saga, Elijah Wood, el actor que interpreta a Radagast, Sylvester McCoy, y el director de las pel\u00edculas, Peter Jackson, quien recuerda que durante un vuelo se deben apagar los aparatos electr\u00f3nicos.\n\n\"Mir\u00e1 el video m\u00e1s \u00e9pico de seguridad que hicieron nuestros amigos de Air New Zeland, interpretado por algunos rostros familiares de El Hobbit: La Batalla de los cinco ej\u00e9rcitos\", escribi\u00f3 Jackson en su cuenta de Facebook.\n\nEsta no es la primera vez que la aerol\u00ednea aprovecha el \u00e9xito de \"El Hobbit\". En 2012, la compa\u00f1\u00eda realiz\u00f3 otro video, esa vez dirigido por el propio director, basado en la segunda parte de la saga, \"Un viaje inesperado\". El clip incluy\u00f3 un cameo del director neozeland\u00e9s, a quien se lo vio sostener un anillo para volar de inc\u00f3gnito.\n\nDesde que se estren\u00f3 la primera pel\u00edcula de \"El Se\u00f1or de los Anillos\", en 2001, a Nueva Zelanda se la conoce como \"Tierra Media\". El director y guionista de la saga utiliz\u00f3 los escenarios naturales del pa\u00eds para llevar a la pantalla grande al universo de Tolkien. Las llanuras doradas y las enormes monta\u00f1as de Nueva Zelanda dan vida a las tierras de Lothlorien, Hobbiton, Rivendell, lugares donde tambi\u00e9n transcurre la historia de \"El Hobbit\".",

Tolkien debe ser un momento \u00fanico encontrarse con Elijah Wood -actor que da vida a Frodo en la saga 'El se\u00f1or de los anillos- sentado a su lado en el avi\u00f3n. Pero a\u00fan m\u00e1s \u00e9pico debe ser encontrarse a Gandalf 'El gris' ense\u00f1ando a los pasajeros la posici\u00f3n de seguridad que deben adoptar en un avi\u00f3n o a Radagast coloc\u00e1ndose de manera detalla una mascarilla de ox\u00edgeno.\n\nEso mismo es lo que han debido pensar en la compa\u00f1\u00eda Air New Zealand para promocionar sus l\u00edneas con destino a Nueva Zelanda. Incluso el mism\u00edsimo Peter Jackson, encargado de dar vida a la segunda parte de la ficci\u00f3n 'El Hobbit', ha formado parte del reparto de lo que la propia aerol\u00ednea ha bautizado como \"el v\u00eddeo m\u00e1s \u00e9pico sobre seguridad nunca hecho\".\n\nEl v\u00eddeo de seguridad, ese momento tan usual en todos los vuelos, comienza con dos cin\u00e9filos enamorados de la ficci\u00f3n 'El Hobbit' que se encuentran con Elijah Wood, el actor que encarna al hobbit Frodo Bols\u00f3n en 'El se\u00f1or de los anillos' en el mismo vuelo. A partir de ah\u00ed, la imaginaci\u00f3n de estos se dispara.\n\nDurante los cuatro minutos y 27 segundos de duraci\u00f3n del clip, una sucesi\u00f3n de magos, elfos, orcos e incluso Smeagol -o Gollum, cuesti\u00f3n de gustos- animan un v\u00eddeo que deja ning\u00fan cabo suelto sobre el protocolo de seguridad que se debe seguir en un avi\u00f3n y que recrea, de paso, algunos de los escenarios donde transcurre la ficci\u00f3n.\n\nEsta disparatada, aunque completa, versi\u00f3n del v\u00eddeo de seguridad de los vuelos de Air New Zealand, pretende promover el turismo a Nueva Zelanda, pa\u00eds que contiene la gran mayor\u00eda de los exteriores de la pel\u00edcula, y a la vez promocionar la segunda parte de la ficci\u00f3n de Tolkien. El pr\u00f3ximo 17 de diciembre se estrena 'El Hobbit: la batalla de los cinco ej\u00e9rcitos' y este v\u00eddeo es un gracioso preludio de lo que se avecina.",

La gente segu\u00eda hablando de ello y se volvi\u00f3 parte de la cultura popular\".\n\n\"Signific\u00f3 un nuevo punto de vista para la antropolog\u00eda. Los viejos modelos lineales de la antropolog\u00eda quedaron sepultados\", a\u00f1ade.\n\nLos arqu\u00e9ologos contin\u00faan excavando el sitio de la isla de Flores, donde fue hallado el Hobbit.\n\nMuchos m\u00e1s por descubrir\n\nLa publicaci\u00f3n del descubrimiento en 2004 caus\u00f3 sensaci\u00f3n. La noticia de que otra especie humana vivi\u00f3 entre nosotros hasta hace un tiempo relativamente reciente dej\u00f3 al mundo con la boca abierta.\n\nMuchos se preguntaron incluso si el Hobbit, llamado Homo floresiensis, todav\u00eda exist\u00eda en alg\u00fan lugar de la isla de Flores.\n\n\u00bfQuiz\u00e1 hab\u00eda otra especie de humano en alg\u00fan lugar remoto de la Tierra que a\u00fan no se hab\u00eda descubierto?\n\nPor primera vez en miles de a\u00f1os, la noci\u00f3n de que nuestra especie, Homo sapiens, era la \u00fanica especie humana en el planeta se puso en duda.\n\nDesde que se descubri\u00f3 el hallazgo, no se han encontrado m\u00e1s restos f\u00f3siles del Hobbit. Pero aquellos que participaron en la investigaci\u00f3n est\u00e1n convencidos de que hay mucho m\u00e1s por descubrir.\n\n\"El descubrimiento del Hobbit abri\u00f3 la posibilidad de pensar que puede haber otras especies humanas sin descubrir 'all\u00e1 afuera', quiz\u00e1 enterradas a varios metros bajo tierra como el Hobbit, u olvidadas en un caj\u00f3n de alg\u00fan museo, err\u00f3neamente identificadas, o catalogadas como humano moderno inusual\", dice Roberts.\n\n\"Creo que el descubrimiento del Hobbit contribuy\u00f3 a crear un clima en el que est\u00e1 bien esperar lo inesperado\", explica.\n\nSorpresa\n\nLa presencia del Hobbit en Flores sigue siendo un misterio. \u00bfC\u00f3mo lleg\u00f3 hasta all\u00ed? La isla se encuentra al este de la llamada l\u00ednea de Wallace, que marca la separaci\u00f3n entre las islas que rara vez -o nunca- estuvieron conectadas por puentes terrestres con el continente asi\u00e1tico.\n\nEntonces, \u00bfes posible que esta especie de humano primitivo haya tenido la capacidad de construir botes y cruzar el mar?\n\nMuchos creen que el Hobbit desciende de un humano m\u00e1s primitivo llamado Homo erectus que lleg\u00f3 a la isla hace un mill\u00f3n de a\u00f1os y gradualmente se fue volviendo m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o debido a la escasez de alimentos en la isla.\n\nOtros creen que desciende de criaturas semejantes al mono que abandonaron \u00c1frica hace m\u00e1s de dos millones de a\u00f1os. Y hay quienes proponen que estas criaturas eran humanos modernos seriamente enfermos.\n\nSeg\u00fan le dijo Roberts a la BBC, el equipo nunca pens\u00f3 seriamente que se encontrar\u00edan con una nueva especie. De hecho, el equipo estaba buscando los ancestros de los primeros abor\u00edgenes australianos.\n\nPor eso, su reacci\u00f3n ante el hallazgo de un esqueleto diminuto, fue de \"completa sorpresa y excitaci\u00f3n extrema\".\n\n\"Qued\u00e9 totalmente desconcertado. No era el esqueleto del humano moderno que esper\u00e1bamos encontrar, pero \u00bfqu\u00e9 era?\".\n\n\"Result\u00f3 algo completamente nuevo para la ciencia, pero esa es la belleza de lo inesperado\", agrega.\n\nEl viaje reci\u00e9n empieza\n\nHasta la fecha se han encontrado m\u00e1s huesos del Homo floresiensis, pero ning\u00fan cr\u00e1neo nuevo. El mismo equipo que descubri\u00f3 el Hobbit contin\u00faa trabajando en las excavaciones con la esperanza de hallar nuevas claves.\n\nLa prioridad ahora es construir una imagen de la distribuci\u00f3n de la especie, cu\u00e1ndo lleg\u00f3 por primera vez a Flores y cu\u00e1ndo y c\u00f3mo se extingui\u00f3.\n\n\"Tenemos tanto que aprender todav\u00eda sobre el Hobbit\", explica Roberts. \"C\u00f3mo desarroll\u00f3 sus peculiares caracter\u00edsticas anat\u00f3micas y si alguna vez se encontr\u00f3 con los humanos modernos cuando se dispersaban por Asia y por el sur hacia Australia\".\n\n\"Por eso, a\u00fan despu\u00e9s de 10 a\u00f1os, todav\u00eda se siente como si la aventura del descubrimiento reci\u00e9n estuviera empezando\", concluye el investigador.",
