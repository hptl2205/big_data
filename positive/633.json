Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced this feature in Tokyo, in lieu of the great earthquake and Tsunami that hit Japan a few years ago. The calamity inspired Facebook to build the first version of this feature for Japan, and now this feature is available worldwide.\n\nDuring a disaster, the Safety Check feature helps users to inform their friends and family that they are safe, users can also check on others in the affected region and can even mark their friends as safe.\n\nThe safety feature works when it is activated after a natural disaster has occurred and if a user is in the vicinity of the affected area, he/she will receive a Facebook notification asking if they're safe. Facebook will then automatically determine their location by the user's last location and the city where the user is using the Internet.\n\nIf Facebook determines the wrong location, users can mark that they are outside the vicinity of the affected area. Meanwhile if they are safe, they can select 'I am safe' and a notification and a News Feed story will generate automatically with the user's friends. Even friends can mark a user as safe.\n\nEven if users have friends in the affected area and the tool has been activated, they will receive a notification about those friends that have marked themselves as safe.

Google's Map service includes disaster relief efforts and hotspots when problems occur -- such as the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami -- and Facebook has now entered the fray with \"Safety Check,\" a tool which is activated in times of crisis.\n\nFacebook announced the new service in a blog post Wednesday. Safety Check is available for users worldwide, and is compatible with multiple platforms and devices.\n\nThe tool is activated automatically when disaster strikes. If you are within the affected area, you'll receive a Facebook notification asking if you are safe. Your location is determined by listed cities on your profile, your last check-in, and where you are using the Internet. You can then check \"I'm Safe\" and both a notification and News Feed story will generate in an update.\n\nIn case you cannot access the Web, friends can also mark you as safe on your behalf.\n\nThe company writes:\n\n\"In times of disaster or crisis, people turn to Facebook to check on loved ones and get updates. It is in these moments that communication is most critical both for people in the affected areas and for their friends and families anxious for news.\"\n\nThe Safety Check tool was developed following the launch of the Disaster Message Board in Japan at the time of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The Disaster Message Board service helped connect survivors with family as communication lines failed, and the lessons learned from this situation resulted in the new, global tool.\n\n\"Our engineers in Japan took the first step toward creating a product to improve the experience of reconnecting after a disaster,\" the company writes. \"They built the Disaster Message Board to make it easier to communicate with others. They launched a test of the tool a year later and the response was overwhelming.\"\n\nRead on: In the world of innovation\n\n10 innovations in the 3D printing realm Google launches quantum processor, artificial intelligence project Drone captures progress of Apple's 'spaceship' campus project Waze unveils government data exchange program Kickstarter revamps Terms of Use, straightens out creator accountability",

Childhood best friends teach us how important a genuine friendship is.\n\nChildhood best friends inherently know how important it is to ignore awkward qualities. After all, they helped you through those tricky preteen years.\n\nChildhood best friends also know your quirks and struggles better than anyone, since they've spent a lot of time with your family.\n\nLikewise, your childhood best friends are likely from the same hometown. This means they've seen how far you've come, so you don't have to explain it.\n\nChildhood best friends understand how to be supportive, since they saw you through some of your most turbulent years.\n\nAt the same time, however, childhood best friends always know when we need a little push to be our best.\n\nChildhood best friends also understand what it takes to overcome some of the toughest challenges in life. From awkward moments to heartbreaks, your childhood best friends are there through it all.\n\nThis means your childhood best friends have bonds with you that other people will likely never come close to.\n\nYou never need to waste time explaining your life, because your childhood best friend lived it, too.\n\nAnd since they've been there through it all, they know how to not embarrass you. You've done enough of that on your own.\n\nThough some people might be put off by your eccentricities, the true childhood best friend loves them.\n\nChildhood best friends know they can walk in without knocking, and you know you can do the same at your place.\n\nSince childhood best friends have a front row seat to your ups and downs, they know why certain people drive you crazy.\n\nChildhood best friends understand the importance of telling a story right, and will always fill in the blanks when you forget details.\n\nSimilarly, childhood best friends are always there when you need to get nostalgic about the good old days.",

Al menos esa es la premisa con la que Mark Zuckerberg ha presentado esta nueva apuesta de su empresa por mantener a todo el mundo conectado.\n\nSeg\u00fan un mensaje publicado por la compa\u00f1\u00eda estadounidense, Safety Check ha sido creada para cubrir esa falta de informaci\u00f3n que tienen los usuarios de la red social durante ciertas crisis. Dicen desde Facebook que \"ese momento es uno de los m\u00e1s cr\u00edticos por la desinformaci\u00f3n y las ansias de noticias\". Por eso, dicen, \"ofrecemos una herramienta f\u00e1cil y simple que ayude a decir que est\u00e1s bien y comprobar que los dem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n lo est\u00e1n\".\n\nEl tsunami de Jap\u00f3n, el gran precedente\n\nSeg\u00fan confirma la web especializada The Verge, Zuckerberg present\u00f3 la herramienta este mi\u00e9rcoles en Jap\u00f3n, pa\u00eds que todav\u00eda est\u00e1 recuper\u00e1ndose de los efectos del tsunami de 2011. Y han sido, precisamente, este tipo de crisis, las que han hecho a Facebook estudiar el comportamiento de sus usuarios durante las cat\u00e1strofes. 'Tabl\u00f3n de anuncios de desastres\" fue la primera versi\u00f3n lanzada en Jap\u00f3n en 2012 por los ingerieros de la compa\u00f1\u00eda.\n\nY es ahora cuando Facebook sigue apostando por esta herramienta que estar\u00e1 disponible en todo el mundo para Android, iOs, en m\u00f3viles y en pc's.",
