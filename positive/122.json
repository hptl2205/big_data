                    "body": "Stargazers across the United States were awed by last night's total eclipse of the moon, and they've got some amazing photos to prove it.\n Observers in a North America, South America, Hawaii and parts of Alaska got a spectacular show as the moon turned blood red during the first total lunar eclipse of 2014.  While the weather wasn't great for everyone in the path of the total eclipse, some stargazers got a break from the clouds to capture the celestial sight during the 3.5 hours it was visible.  You can also watch a time-lapse video of the \"Blood Moon\" rising on Space.c com.\n \"We lucked out on the weather, as skies were mostly cloudy during the afternoon and evening, and even during the eclipse we were viewing through a thin layer of cirrus much of the time,\" veteran rocket launch photographer Ben Cooper told Space.com via email of his Florida eclipse-viewing experience.  While Cooper may have seen the eclipse through clouds, his mosaic photo is a standout.  It features a blood red moon in the center of the image framed by the various stages of the lunar eclipse.  [See more photos of the first total lunar eclipse of 2014]\nThis kind of lunar eclipse is sometimes known as Blood Moon because the sunlight scattered by Earth's atmosphere casts a red pall on the face of the moon.\n \"Tonight's lunar eclipse was an unforgettable experience for me,\" Arizona-based cinematographer Sean Parker told Space.com via email.  \"It was such a great sight to see.\" \"\nThe April 14-15 total lunar eclipse was also paired with another stellar sighting.  The bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo was positioned to the right and below the moon.  Spica's bright bluish light would have been even more pronounced as the moon darkened during the eclipse.\n Just before the eclipse, Mars made its closest approach to Earth since 2008.  The Red Planet passed within 57.4 million miles (92.4 million kilometers) of Earth, giving the moon a Martian companion during the night.\n Some astrophotographers were able to capture the moon, Mars and Spica in the same frame.\n \"Very beautiful event,\" photographer Victor Rogus told Space.com via email.  He sent in his view of the eclipse, Spica and Mars from Jadwin, Mo. \"Clouds parted just in time, thank you!\"\nSome photographers blended Earth's natural beauty with the lunar eclipse by choosing the perfect spot for a celestial viewing.  Photographer Ryan Watamura, for example, captured the eclipse from Grant's Grove in Kings Canyon National Park in California.  His photos frame the copper-colored moon with the majestic trees of Grant's Grove.\n Lunar eclipses occur when the moon is full and passes behind the Earth, with respect to the sun, and is obscured by the planet's shadow.  Total lunar eclipses happen when the moon is totally covered by Earth's shadow, darkening its typically bright face.\n The April total lunar eclipse also kicks off a so-called \"tetrad\" of four consecutive total lunar eclipses between now and September 2015.  The next total lunar eclipse will occur on Oct. 8 and should also be visible from much of North America.\n Later this month, from April 28 to April 29, the sun will turn into a \"ring of fire\" during an annular eclipse.  That solar eclipse, however, will only be visible from an uninhabitated part of Antarctica, so it is possible that only be penguins can see it.\n Editor's Note: If you snapped an amazing picture of the April 15 total lunar eclipse, you can send photos, comments and your name and location to managing editor Tariq Malik at spacephotos@space.com.",

Check out this map where the eclipse will most visible.\n Lunar eclipses only occur when there's a full moon.  A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is directly opposite the sun and passes into Earth's dark shadow.  The eclipse will begin by 12:53am EDT and will continue through 4:34am with the \"totality\" phase occurring around 3:06am.\n At the time of the eclipse, the moon will take on a reddish hue.  This is because of Earth's atmosphere.  The suns' rays will pass through our atmosphere scattering the light, which is the same phenomenon that gives us colorful sunrises and sunsets.  Space.com has an even more in-depth explanation of lunar eclipses, if you want to read more.\n Even though we in D.C. won't be able to catch sight of the lunar eclipse from home, NASA will live stream the eclipse beginning at 10 p.m. tonight.  You can also check the planet Mars' approach, which is the closest the planet's been to Earth since 2008.\n This lunar celestial phenomenon will be the first in a series of four eclipses, also called a \"lunar tetrad.\" \" The next will occur on October 8th 2014, the next April 4, 2015, and the final September 28, 2015.",

For those in North America, and western South America, including Hawaii and parts of Alaska, the eclipse will begin minutes before 1:00 a.m. EDT and last until 6 a.m. EDT.  The last total lunar eclipse was in 2010, but in this unique astronomical series the next total lunar eclipse is expected October 8, 2014.\n A front row seat to the spectacle will be dependent on weather patterns in the area.  A small scattering of clouds should not effect viewing.  It is suspected, already, that parts the eastern U. S. will have a poor display this time around.  If unfortunate weather problems overshadow the eclipse, or for those in Europe or Asia who will not be able to view the event, or for those who cannot stay up all night to watch as the Earth masks the moon, live webcasts are available on Space.c com, courtesy of NASA, and the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles will be streaming the event live.\n For those in visibility areas with cooperative weather, the eclipse will be easy enough to see with the naked eye.  No visual protection is necessary.  A handy set of common binoculars or an amateurs, backyard telescope should be enough to get an up close and personal vivid viewing, but the phases of the eclipse will be discernible without magnification.  It is suggested to get out into an open space, bring a few lawn chairs, a blanket, a bottle of wine, and a few friends.\n A total lunar eclipse is the result of Earth, the sun, and a full moon in perfect alignment.  As the Earth rotates, its shadow eclipses the moon, darkening its surface bit by bit.  At first, it will appear as if the orb's surface is slightly darker than normal, but eventually a deeper, darker shadow will increasingly crawl across the disc.  This event is also referred to as a \"blood moon,\" because the shadowing effect will be revealed as a rich, ruddy color as a result of the sun's refraction off of the Earth's atmosphere.  It is the same reaction as when the sun turns a bolder orange color at sundown.  In tonight's scenario, the refracted sunlight will extend all the way to the moon.  To put it into perspective, if one were standing on the moon during the total eclipse, they would be able to see all of the sunsets and sunrises projected from Earth.\n In addition to the eclipse later tonight, another astronomical happenstance will be visible.  Mars will have made a cozy spot in the night sky as a fiery red bed fellow to the moon.\n Tonight's event will begin the larger event of the lunar tetrad.  A lunar tetrad is a result of four consecutive total lunar eclipses without subsequent partial lunar eclipses in between, and each total lunar eclipse is spaced from the other by six full moons.  The three other eclipses will being happening on October 8 of this year, and on April 8 and September 28 of 2015.  Although a tetrad is a rare event, it is by no means unknown.  There is predicted to be eight lunar tetrads between 2001 and 2100.\n To get accurate information as far as when to watch the total lunar eclipse begin, there is a lunar eclipse computer available at U.S. Naval Observatory's website.  Simply select a viewing city and state, and a viewing time-table will be calculated.  Happy moon gazing!",

So there's no real rush to run out and catch it.\n The real trick is hoping that the weather cooperates.

It is the total lunar eclipse that will reveal the blood moon in the night sky tonight opening up theories of all sorts.\n According to Fox News on April 14, this is the first lunar eclipse of 2014 and it will be visible across most of North America and South America.  Hawaii and parts of Alaska should also be able to see the night extravaganza.  Your ticket to a front row seat is going to depend upon the weather you are experiencing overhead.\n The lunar eclipse runs from 12:53 a.m. ET to about 6 a.m. ET, so if you are late to bed or early to rise, check out the sky above, according to Mass Live.  Clear skies will bring the blood moon for your viewing pleasure.  So what do you expect to see during a lunar eclipse?  The full moon passes through part of the Earth's shadow, which darkens the moon's glow.  A full lunar eclipse is a bit different.  It brings with it a color show!\n When it is a full lunar eclipse, like tonight, a blood moon appears as the moon is totally covered by the Earth's shadow enticing that red hue.  This happens as the Earth's atmosphere catches the little bit of sunlight that breaks through.  You can watch the full lunar eclipse and the blood moon online here at NOAA.\n Tonight's blood moon is the first of four over the next year and a half.  The next blood moon coming from another full lunar eclipse will take place in November.  Then again in April of 2015, with September 2015 hosting the last of the four blood moons and the last of the four full lunar eclipses, as the two go hand and hand.\n Is the full lunar eclipse and the blood moon the start of end of days?  If you believe what bestselling author and Texas televangelist pastor John Hagee has to say, you might think so.  Hagee sees the four blood moons as evidence of a future \"world-shaking event,\" possibly the beginning of the end of the world.\n He wrote a book on his preparation for the tetrad of the blood moons, which he has been preaching for years.  He has looked to the Bible for the signs and he cites Acts 2:19-20 as a sign.  It says:\n\"And I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the Earth beneath, the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.\" \"\nThe good news if you believe Hagee's theory is that you still have three blood moons to live through.  While the first blood moon might start shaking things up, like the earthquakes that seem plentiful in recent weeks, the world should be here for at least another year!",

But, there are ways to watch the celestial show no matter what the conditions.\n If it's clear, look outside.  The eclipse of the moon goes into partial phase at 1:58 a.m. EDT on Tuesday.  Total lunar eclipse begins at 3:07 a.m. and continues until 4:25 a.m. The website earthsky.org has a handy list of North American times for when the key points in the eclipse here \"\nIf it's cloudy, NASA plans live coverage and commentary of the eclipse on its UStream channel embedded below:\nAccording to the NASA website, this is the last chance to see a total lunar eclipse in its entirety in the U.S. until 2019:\nThe United States will be in a prime orbital position and time of day to view the eclipse.  Depending on local weather conditions, the public will get a spectacular view looking into the sky as the moon's appearance will change from bright orange to blood red to dark brown and perhaps gray.  The eclipse is a phenomenon that occurs when the Earth, moon and sun are in perfect alignment, blanketing the moon in the Earth's shadow.  The United States will not be able to witness a full lunar eclipse in its entirety again until 2019.\n A lot of people have been talking about the eclipse being a blood moon, for various reasons.  The moon will appear reddish for a while, for sure.  That has to do with the light that is being reflected back on to it during the eclipse (rather than the bright light of the sun that directly hits the moon when it isn't being eclipsed).  Sky and Telescope has a fact-filled article on tonight's lunar eclipse, including this explanation of what the moon will look like during early hours of April 15:\nOur atmosphere scatters and refracts (bends) sunlight that grazes the rim of our globe, so that red glow comes from all the sunrises and sunsets around Earth's terminator at the moment.  If you were an astronaut standing on the Moon, you'd see Earth ringed with a thin, brilliant band of sunset- and sunrise-colored light.  On rare occasions the eclipsed Moon does go black.  Other times it appears as bright and coppery as a new penny.  Sometimes it turns brown like chocolate, or as dark red as dried blood.\n Many scientists have said the term \"Blood Moon\" is not a scientific one but a religious one.  EarthSky.org gives a comprehensive overview of blood moons and their background here \"\nAlso, Karl Tate, SPACE.com Infographics Artist, has an excellent \"Blood Moons Explained\" multimedia presentation here \"\nEarthSky.org and SPACE.com both note that tonight marks the beginning of a lunar tetrad, or four lunar eclipses in a row.  NASA explains a lunar tetrad here \"\nThe other lunar eclipses in the current tetrad will take place on Oct. 8 and in 2015 on April 4 and Sept. 28.\n Next up on the 2014 eclipse calendar: An annual solar eclipse on April 29 that won't be viewable in the Northern Hemisphere.",

The other eclipses in the series will occur in six-month intervals:\n2014:\nTotal lunar eclipse: April 14-15\nTotal lunar eclipse: October 8\n2015:\nTotal lunar eclipse: April 4\nTotal lunar eclipse: September 28\nA lunar eclipse happens when the earth lies in between the sun and the moon.  This means the sun's light is blocked by the earth, and the moon passes into its shadow.\n During the eclipse, the moon took on a dramatic blood red appearance.  In ancient times this was thought to be a bad omen, but now it is understood that it is simply due to the scattering of light by the air in our atmosphere.\n The scattering of light is something that happens every day.  Blue light is scattered most effectively, and this explains why the sky is blue.  Red light, on the other hand, is scattered least, which is why the setting sun is red.\n When the sun, earth and moon are all lined up, the sun's rays shine on the edges of the earth, and through our atmosphere.  As they pass through the air, the atmosphere bends (refracts) them, and focuses them on the moon.\n As well as being bent, the light has also been scattered.  The blues and greens have been scattered, leaving only the red and orange tones.  This gives the moon a strange red glow as it disappears into the earth's shadow.\n Unlike a solar eclipse, no special filters are required to protect your eyes.  This means that this spectacle is completely safe to view with the naked eye, and for those who missed it, there is only a six-month wait until the next one.",

The shadow doesn't block out the moon completely, but rather causes it to glow an eerie shade of red.  That's because light scattered by Earth's atmosphere still manages to reach the lunar surface.\n If you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, you would see Earth surrounded by a fiery ring of orange -- the light of all the sunsets and sunrises at that particular moment in time.\n Total lunar eclipses occur about two times a year, but they are only visible from certain parts of Earth.  Here in North America, we haven't been able to see a total lunar eclipse since 2011, according to Sky and Telescope Magazine.\n If you live in the continental United States, and you've got clear skies, and it's not too freezing outside, we strongly suggest you look away from the computer and up in the sky to experience the eclipse for yourself, at least for a little bit.

By 2 a.m. there should be a full lunar eclipse that lasts just over an hour.\n Some Christians see this series of so-called blood moons as linked to a biblical prophecy of the End Times.\n A lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, Earth and moon line up so the Earth's shadow falls on the moon, darkening it.\n \"Eclipses are one of the few astronomical events that can easily be enjoyed with the naked eye,\" though a pair of binoculars brings it into even greater focus, said astronomy writer Gary Kronk.\n As it begins, \"the Earth's shadow will make a slow crawl across the moon's face, appearing as if there is an increasingly large 'bite' taken out of the moon,\" said Deborah Byrd with EarthSky.o org, an online science magazine.\n At first, the full moon will just appear to be a little darker than normal, \"but eventually people will notice a much darker arc moving across the moon, with a distinct rusty reddish-brown color,\" said astronomer Gerald McKeegan at the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, Calif.\nThe bloody red color the moon takes on during an eclipse is caused by refraction of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere.\n \"It is the same effect that you see when the sun turns reddish-orange at sunset, only in this case the refracted sunlight projects all the way to the moon,\" McKeegan said.\n This eclipse also features an extra astronomical quirk.

NASA\nA total lunar eclipse is coming Tuesday, and there has been plenty of talk about the \"blood moon\" and the beginning of a lunar tetrad.  Whether or not you believe in prophecies, the total lunar eclipse will be a skywatcher's delight and there will be several live streams of the event.\n While you can view the full moon on Monday, those wishing to see the total lunar eclipse will have to stay up late.  According to NASA, the eclipse will begin around 2 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, when the moon will enter the partial shadow, or penumbra, of the Earth.  During that time, stargazers will see a sped-up version of the phases of the moon.  The peak of the total lunar eclipse begins at 3:45 a.m. EDT, when the moon enters Earth's shadow, known as the umbra.  During that time, the moon will turn a shade of red.\n Slooh astronomer Bob Berman explains the phenomenon: \"All the world's sunrises and sunsets send their indirect light to the moon at this time -- as the only light hitting the Moon.  The result is that the fully eclipsed moon assumes a gorgeous coppery color.\" \" The total lunar eclipse will be visible across North America.\n The Virtual Telescope Project will also have a live stream of the lunar eclipse, The broadcast begins at 2:30 a.m. EDT and can be viewed here.  A fourth lunar eclipse live stream will originate from Columbus State University beginning at 11 p.m. EDT.\n NASA's total lunar eclipse live stream begins around 2 a.m. EDT, and the space agency hosted a Reddit AMA session with planetary scientist Renee Weber.  The space agency will host a Web chat with astronomer Mitzi Adams and astrophysicist Alphonse Sterling beginning at 1 a.m. EDT at the dedicated lunar eclipse page.\n The Slooh broadcast will originate from the Prescott Observatory in Arizona and will feature Berman, Slooh observatory director Paul Cox and Duncan Copp, professor emeritus of astronomy at University of California Berkeley, discussing the total lunar eclipse.  As Slooh notes, the total lunar eclipse comes on the heels of the closest approach of Mars.  As stargazers observe the eclipse they will also be able to see Mars and Spica, a bright blue star.\n The view from New York at 1 a.m. EDT on Tuesday.  The total lunar eclipse begins at 2 a.m. EDT and reaches its peak at 3:45 a.m. EDT.  In the photo, Mars is a red dot to the right of the moon.  SLOOH\nTuesday's total lunar eclipse marks the beginning of a tetrad, a series of four total lunar eclipses occurring every six months.  The next total lunar eclipse will take place on Oct. 8.  The tetrad has led to some talk about the \"end of days\" or something historical cataclysmic during this event, but chances are that if anything does happen it's coincidental and nothing to do with a blood moon.  The \"blood moon prophecy\" has been touted by Texas pastor John Hagee, who has written a series of books linking the tetrad to a passages in the Bible.\n The total lunar eclipse also will have engineers at NASA nervous, as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will not have chance to recharge its batteries because it will pass through the Earth's shadow twice and relies on solar power to replenish its batteries.\n Slooh's total eclipse live stream begins at 2 a.m. EDT and can be viewed below.\n NASA's broadcast of the total eclipse will begin around 2 a.m. EDT.

The sunset hue lasts up to an hour.\n The moon appeared reddest Tuesday around 3 a.m.\nYou'll have to be an early riser to catch the October \"blood moon.\" \" That total eclipse will begin at 6:25 a.m. Clear skies are key and people on the West Coast will have the best view.\n NASA eclipse expert Fred Espenak pointed out that this lunar eclipse series is unique because all four eclipses will be visible in North America, which isn't always the case.\n There are about two lunar eclipses a year, but you'll only see a blood mood during a total eclipse.  There are also partial eclipses, when the moon only passes into part of Earth's shadow, and penumbral eclipses, when the moon barely grazes the Earth's shadow, which is so subtle most sky-gazers don't even notice.",

That event occurs when there are four successive total lunar eclipses, with no partial lunar eclipses in between, each of which is separated from the other by six full moons.\n A book out last year, Four Blood Moons: Something is about to change, suggests the event could be a fulfillment of biblical prophecy.\n In it, John Hagee writes that the red disks of the moon during the full eclipses are referred to in the book of Joel 2:31: \"The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\" \"\nThe other three eclipses of this lunar tetrad are on Oct. 8 of this year and then April 8 and Sept. 28 of 2015.\n Tetrads are by no means unknown, says Byrd.  There will be a total of eight lunar tetrads between 2001 and 2100.",

Though it is going to be visible three more times from today to October 2015, nonetheless it doesn't happen very often and is happening after a very long time.\n Yes total lunar eclipse is underway and the whole world seems to be watching it at the moment.  I mean those part of the world where it is still night.  In many nations in the east in Asia and Oceana, it is already day and the sun is visible in full force, so enjoying a lunar eclipse there is utterly impossible.\n But in this part of the world where it is still night we are all set to enjoy the eclipse.  Though the fact that the eclipse is happening very late in the night and much of it will be in after the sunrise, nonetheless it hasn't reduced the charm of the total lunar eclipse that many are also calling blood eclipse.\n But if you live in a place where it is daytime, you shouldn't feel let down as it is being live streamed and you can watch it live.  But the fact that the eclipse in the United States will be visible only after midnight may be a bit unnerving for some.  So if you are eager to experience this rare eclipse tonight you will have to keep yourself awake.  If you thought that you can get up after midnight to experience the eclipse, your chance of witnessing it are as good as zero except if you have the same rare determination as this lunar eclipse.  Most of the people cannot actually manage to get up despite setting alarm for midnight.  So it is always better to be ready for the occasion in the best way.\n There is no denying the fact that enthusiasm for this solar eclipse is rather very high.  This is one of the most awaited total lunar eclipses and people have been waiting for it for weeks if not months.  But the moon is going to be fully eclipsed at about 12:07 a.m. According to astronomers, eclipse maximum is at 12:46.  During this moment, the moon will enter the Earth's umbra.  And it is this time when there will be complete shadow.  That is not the end of the whole process.  As time passes, the moon will continue to get progressively darker.  It will move deeper into the umbra.\n For millions and millions of skylovers in this part of the world it is a great opportunity to enjoy the occasion.  Experts are giving their own advises to people interested in watching the lunar eclipse.  Joe Sirard, an amateur astronomer says, \"We'll have clear skies -- even down to the beaches...W We've got four in a row that we're going to be seeing here in North America, which is pretty nice...I It doesn't happen too often that we get to see that many in a row.\" \" This is enticing time.  And if you don't find weather very clear you can always opt for Slooh.C Com that will be live streaming the lunar eclipse.",

[Blood Moon Photos: Amazing Total Lunar Eclipse Views for April 15]\nThe lunar eclipse peaked at 3 a.m. EDT (0700 GMT), with the moon taking 78 minutes to pass through the darkest point of Earth's shadow.  It was visible from most of North and South America, Hawaii and parts of Alaska.  The eclipse was the first of four consecutive total lunar eclipses, known as a \"tetrad,\" between April 2014 and September 2015.\n Astronomer Bob Berman, who hosted a live lunar eclipse webcast for the Slooh community telescope using views from Arizona's Prescott Observatory, said event was also one for the record books because of another bright object in the predawn sky.\n \"It was the most special one, I would say, of our lives,\" Berman said during the Slooh webcast.  \"What made it particularly extraordinary was that it happened on the same night as the closest approach of Mars to Earth in years.\" \"\nMars made its closest approach to Earth since 2008 on Monday night (April 14), coming within 57.4 million miles (92.4 million km) of our planet.\n So the Red Planet and the \"Blood Moon\" shined together in the predawn sky in a rare event, Berman said, adding that the bright blue star Spica completed the show.\n \"We'll never again for the rest of our lives see a total eclipse of the moon on the same night as the closest approach of a bright planet like Mars,\" Berman said.\n Space.com was flooded with lunar eclipse photos taken by excited observers from across the United States, with images coming in from Hawaii, Puerto Rico and even a Disney Fantasy cruise ship in the Gulf of Mexico.\n While heavy cloud cover and rain threatened to spoil the total lunar eclipse for observers in the eastern United States, stargazers in the central and western United States got a good lunar show.  In addition to the Slooh webcast, several other groups streamed live views of the eclipse.\n The University of Arizona's Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter at the Steward Observatory atop Mt. Lemmon in Arizona streamed spectacular telescope views of the eclipse from its start to finish.  NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama teamed up with the iconic Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, Calif., to offer another view.\n NASA is also keeping close watch on two solar-powered spacecraft currently orbiting the moon.  The lack of sunlight on the moon during the eclipse was expected to starve NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and LADEE moon dust probe, both of which are solar powered.\n Meanwhile, the Virtual Telescope Project in Ceccano, Italy (where the eclipse was not visible) streamed live views of spectacular eclipse photos by astrophotgraphers across the United States.  In South America, the Gloria Project held a live webcast at the Incan ruins of Cusco, Peru to mark the event.\n Photographer Tyler Leavitt of Las Vegas, Nevada, captured a stunning series of images showing the moon slowly waltz into Earth's shadow, then take on its iconic blood-red hue.  Leavitt took the photos from his front driveway between 11:30 p.m. and 1:20 a.m. PDT, and he was not alone.\n \"It was nice to see several of the neighbors coming out to take a look also,\" Leavitt told Space.com in an email.\n Lunar eclipses occur when the moon is full and passes through part or all of the Earth's shadow.  Total lunar eclipses happen when the moon is totally enveloped by Earth's shadow, darkening the face of the moon.  Because the moon's orbit is tilted, it does not perfectly align with Earth and the sun every month so lunar\nLater this month, from April 28 to April 29, the sun will turn into a \"ring of fire\" during an annular eclipse.  It's possible, however, that the celestial sight will only be visible for penguins.  The solar eclipse's totality will only be visible over an uninhabited part of Antarctica.  This year's total lunar eclipses and solar eclipses are among the most promising stargazing events of 2014.\n The next total lunar eclipse of 2014 will occur on Oct. 8, followed by another on April 8, 2015 and the last total lunar eclipse of the current tetrad on Sept. 28, 2015.\n Editor's Note: If you snapped an amazing picture of the April 15 total lunar eclipse, you can send photos, comments and your name and location to managing editor Tariq Malik at spacephotos@space.com.",

Previously, an eclipse tetrad occurred from 2003 to 2004.  The next time skywatchers will be treated to four consecutive total lunar eclipses will be in the years 2032 to 2033, according to NASA.\n 4.  It's called a \"blood moon\"\nDuring an eclipse, the moon may turn a red or coppery color as it reflects sunrises and sunsets happening around the world.  While the moon is in shadow, some light from the sun shines through Earth's atmosphere.  Red light (unlike other colors that are blocked and scattered) is better able to penetrate the atmosphere, which creates this \"bloody\" effect.\n 5.  Don't worry, the world is not going to end\nDespite rumors circulating online that suggest the lunar eclipse tetrad is linked to biblical prophesies of the apocalypse, there is no reason to fear tonight's blood moon, according to astronomers.  In fact, eclipse tetrads are not particularly rare, Espenak said.\n \"During the 21st century, there are nine sets of tetrads, so I would describe tetrads as a frequent occurrence in the current pattern of lunar eclipses,\" he explained.  \"But this has not always been the case.  During the 300-year interval from 1600 to 1990, for instance, there were no tetrads at all.\" \"",

(AP) -- Parts of North and South America, got a look Tuesday morning at the first eclipse of the year -- in color.\n The moon was eclipsed by Earth's shadow.  This total lunar eclipse was visible across the Western Hemisphere.  The total phase will lasted 78 minutes, beginning at 3:06 a.m. EDT and ending at 4:24 a.m. EDT.\n A cold front brought clouds and rain into Pennsylvania on Monday night, prevented residents in our region for being able to witness the event.\n Even though the moon is in the Earth's shadow, it appeared a bit colorful, some shade of red or orange.  That's from light around the edges of the Earth -- essentially sunrises and sunsets -- splashing on the lunar surface and faintly lighting up the moon, said Alan MacRobert, senior editor at Sky & Telescope magazine.\n On April 29, the Southern Hemisphere will be treated to a rare type of solar eclipse.\n In all, four eclipses will occur this year, two lunar and two solar.\n Tuesday's lunar eclipse may damage a NASA spacecraft that's been circling the moon since fall.  But no worries: it's near the end of its mission.\n The robotic orbiter LADEE was never designed to endure a lengthy eclipse.  Scientists don't know if it will withstand the prolonged cold of the hours-long eclipse.\n Even if it freezes up, LADEE will crash into the far side of the moon the following week as planned, after successfully completing its science mission.

(Desiree Martin/AFP/Getty Images)\nThe moon took on an eerie blood-red hue early Tuesday during the first total lunar eclipse of 2014, a celestial sight that wowed potentially millions of stargazers across North and South America.\n The total lunar eclipse of April 15 lasted about 3.5 hours between late Monday and early Tuesday, with the Earth's shadow slowing darkening the face of the so-called \"Blood Moon\" in a jaw-dropping sight for stargazers willing to stay up extra late or rise super-early for the event.\n \"Definitely worth the early wake-up call,\" skywatcher Brett Bonine of Arkansas told Space.com in an email.  [Blood Moon Photos: Amazing Total Lunar Eclipse Views for April 15]\n(MORE: SpaceX Launch Encounters Trouble)\nThe lunar eclipse peaked at 3 a.m. EDT (0700 GMT), with the moon taking 78 minutes to pass through the darkest point of Earth's shadow.  It was visible from most of North and South America, Hawaii and parts of Alaska.  The eclipse was the first of four consecutive total lunar eclipses, known as a \"tetrad,\" between April 2014 and September 2015.\n Astronomer Bob Berman, who hosted a live lunar eclipse webcast for the Slooh community telescope using views from Arizona's Prescott Observatory, said event was also one for the record books because of another bright object in the predawn sky.\n \"It was the most special one, I would say, of our lives,\" Berman said during the Slooh webcast.  \"What made it particularly extraordinary was that it happened on the same night as the closest approach of Mars to Earth in years.\" \"\nMars made its closest approach to Earth since 2008 on Monday night (April 14), coming within 57.4 million miles (92.4 million km) of our planet.\n So the Red Planet and the \"Blood Moon\" shined together in the predawn sky in a rare event, Berman said, adding that the bright blue star Spica completed the show.\n (WATCH: Humans to Mars, But When?)\n\"We'll never again for the rest of our lives see a total eclipse of the moon on the same night as the closest approach of a bright planet like Mars,\" Berman said.\n Space.com was flooded with lunar eclipse photos taken by excited observers from across the United States, with images coming in from Hawaii, Puerto Rico and even a Disney Fantasy cruise ship in the Gulf of Mexico.\n While heavy cloud cover and rain threatened to spoil the total lunar eclipse for observers in the eastern United States, stargazers in the central and western United States got a good lunar show.  In addition to the Slooh webcast, several other groups streamed live views of the eclipse.\n The University of Arizona's Mt. Lemmon SkyCenter at the Steward Observatory atop Mt. Lemmon in Arizona streamed spectacular telescope views of the eclipse from its start to finish.  NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama teamed up with the iconic Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, Calif., to offer another view.\n NASA is also keeping close watch on two solar-powered spacecraft currently orbiting the moon.  The lack of sunlight on the moon during the eclipse was expected to starve NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and LADEE moon dust probe, both of which are solar powered.\n Meanwhile, the Virtual Telescope Project in Ceccano, Italy (where the eclipse was not visible) streamed live views of spectacular eclipse photos by astrophotgraphers across the United States.  In South America, the Gloria Project held a live webcast at the Incan ruins of Cusco, Peru to mark the event.\n (MORE: What Exactly Happened to Space Shuttle Columbia?)\nPhotographer Tyler Leavitt of Las Vegas, Nevada, captured a stunning series of images showing the moon slowly waltz into Earth's shadow, then take on its iconic blood-red hue.  Leavitt took the photos from his front driveway between 11:30 p.m. and 1:20 a.m. PDT, and he was not alone.\n \"It was nice to see several of the neighbors coming out to take a look also,\" Leavitt told Space.com in an email.\n Lunar eclipses occur when the moon is full and passes through part or all of the Earth's shadow.  Total lunar eclipses happen when the moon is totally enveloped by Earth's shadow, darkening the face of the moon.  Because the moon's orbit is tilted, it does not perfectly align with Earth and the sun every month so lunar\nLater this month, from April 28 to April 29, the sun will turn into a \"ring of fire\" during an annular eclipse.  It's possible, however, that the celestial sight will only be visible for penguins.  The solar eclipse's totality will only be visible over an uninhabited part of Antarctica.  This year's total lunar eclipses and solar eclipses are among the most promising stargazing events of 2014.\n The next total lunar eclipse of 2014 will occur on Oct. 8, followed by another on April 8, 2015 and the last total lunar eclipse of the current tetrad on Sept. 28, 2015.",

The first of four total lunar eclipses during the next 18 months takes place early Tuesday morning.  The eclipse starts at 11:58 PM Monday night and ends at 3:33 AM Tuesday.  The middle of the eclipse, when the entire moon is a deep red, is at 1:45 AM.\n A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon's orbit takes it into the earth's shadow.  It's a perfect alignment between the sun, earth, and moon.  It turns the moon dark red because the only light that reaches the moon during the eclipse first passes through the earth's atmosphere.  The air scatterers the sunlight and separates into different colors.  The red light makes it through the scattering process and reaches the moon.  It's the same reason sunsets appear red.  University of Montana professor Dan Reisenfeld: \"At that particular moment the only light reaching the moon is all of the sunrises and all of the sunsets on earth all at once.\" \"\nA total lunar eclipse is when the entire moon passes through earth's shadow.  Four total lunar eclipses in a row is called a tetrad.  Eclipses come in predictable cycles, around every six months, but most eclipses have only part of the moon cloaked in shadow; so little that many don't notice.  Reisenfeld states that lunar eclipses are often linked to solar eclipses.  Many fall within two weeks of each other.  Solar eclipses are much harder to spot.  They're only visible in a swath over a couple hundred miles.  A lunar eclipse is visible over whatever continents happen to be at night when the eclipse occurs.  For Montana all four of the upcoming tetrad of eclipses will be visible.  The second eclipse occurs on October 8th.",

If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick, maybe not.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to step outside to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Stan Shadick, an astronomy instructor with the University of Saskatchewan physics and engineering physics department.\n The U of S observatory opens to the public tonight for anyone wanting to get a good view of the blood moon.  It opens at 11:45 p.m. tonight and closes two hours later.  The campus observatory is one block north of the Wiggins Avenue and College Drive intersection.\n The partial phase of the lunar eclipse begins at 11:58 p.m., while the total phase begins at 1:07 a.m. Tuesday.  The full eclipse ends at 2:24 a.m. and the partial eclipse ends at 3:33 a.m.\nAdmission is free.\n If visible, sky watchers could see a reddish-orange moon tonight.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the moon moves into the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think the moon would be completely dark, but the light from the sun gets bent around the Earth and redirects into the shadow faintly illuminating the moon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shadick said.\n The total lunar eclipse this week is the first of four that will occur nearly every six months.  Total lunar eclipses occur twice a year but are not visible everywhere on Earth at the same time.  North America hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen a total lunar eclipse since 2011.\n A total lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, the Earth and the moon are in perfect alignment so that the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow completely covers the surface of the moon.\n Andrew Fazekas, spokesman for the Royal Astronomy Society of Canada, said the actual colour of the eclipse is hard to predict because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influenced by the levels of pollutants and dust that are floating around the Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmosphere.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe more dust there is, the deeper orange and red will be the colour of the lunar eclipse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt varies from one event to the other.\u00e2 \u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFazekas pointed out that, including Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eclipse, Canadians will get to see four in a row \u00e2\u0080\" a series known as a tetrad \u00e2\u0080\" over the next 18 months.\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen \u00e2\u0080\" that tetrad of lunar eclipses\u00e2\u0080\" for another 20 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n The other three will occur Oct. 8 this year and April 4 and Sept. 28, 2015.",

This extraordinary feature is expected to appear on Monday, April 14th night while leaving a very big contrast in the country.  Residents of central and western United States will get a fine view of the \"blood moon.\" \" Whoever expected to see the lunar eclipse from within the mentioned boundary, it will be a great shock since the blood moon is set to appear in all its brilliance.\n Other parts likely to experience the total lunar eclipse include; Alaska, Hawaii, South America and across North America.  Alongside being the first lunar eclipse for 2014, the feature attracts the attention of many scientists and residents in the US.  You need to stay alert to capture it passing live although this depends on your location.  The feature begins late in the night of Monday proceeding into wee hours of Tuesday.  Just pray hard for Mother Nature to take its course for see the total lunar eclipse.\n In terms of exact time to expect the blood moons, you can stay alert from 12.53a.m EDT to about 6a.m translating to 0453 to 1000, GMT.  There are several ways of noticing the appearance of heavenly bodies including eclipses.  On Monday night, there is expected to be a considerable cloudiness situation to much of eastern-third of United States.  This will be brought about by a slow-moving cold front that stretches from western New York State all the way to south-southwest and spreading into the central Gulf of Mexico.  For residents of Sault Ste-Marie, Mich. to Paducah, Ky. to Baton Rouge, and La., they are likely to experience poor sky conditions.\n Generally, this means that there will be a fleeting glimpse of the darkening moon more especially during Tuesday's predawn hours.  In giving a glimpse of hope, people living in inland sections of central and south Florida might be in a position to see the total lunar eclipse.  This is courtesy of a thin cloud layer that will enhance visibility of the shady lunar drama.  In terms of weather conditions, rain is expected in parts of Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys due to showers and scattered thunderstorms.  For snow, it is expected to fall over parts of northwest Ohio and Michigan.\n Occurrence of Lunar Eclipse\nAccording to many researchers and scientists, lunar eclipse is believed to occur when a full moon appears between the sun and the earth.  At the instance when the moon passes through part or all of the Earth's shadow, the moon's bright glow darkens.  It then means that the moon is entirely immersed in Earth shadow hence causing scattering of sunlight through the edges of Earth's atmosphere.  Scenarios like this produces moons specially known as \"blood moons.\" \" Looking at a lunar eclipse tetrad which scientists have predicted to occur between April 2014 and September 2015, Monday's appearance becomes the first of four consecutive total eclipses of the moon.",

The full lunar eclipse - when the entirety of the moon is shaded by Earth - begins just over an hour later at 2:07 a.m. and lasts until 3:25 a.m.\nThe eclipse will be visible across almost the entire continental United States, most of Canada and Central America and parts of South America.\n The coming red moon, which you may have heard called a \"blood moon,\" is a perfectly natural occurrence.\n Every time the moon passes completely into the shadow of the Earth, it turns a reddish color - sometimes a bright copper, other times the dark reddish brown of dried blood.\n The red color occurs because even when the Earth has moved directly between the moon and the sun, the scattered light from all the sunsets and sunrises on the rim of our globe still make it to the moon's surface.\n \"If you were standing on the moon during a total lunar eclipse you would see the Earth as a black disk with a brilliant orange ring around it,\" said Alan MacRobert, of Sky and Telescope magazine.  \"And this brilliant ring would be bright enough to dimly light up the lunar landscape.\" \"\nIt has been a long time since a total lunar eclipse has been visible from the United States.  According to MacRobert, the last one took place on Dec. 11, 2011.  But the good news is there are three more on the way after this one.\n This lunar eclipse is the first in what is called an eclipse tetrad -- four successive lunar eclipses with no partial lunar eclipses in between.\n The next one, which also will be visible from nearly all of North America, will take place in October.\n As for the intriguing term \"blood moon\" - that appears to be new.  MacRobert has been writing about astronomy since 1982, and had never encountered it before.\n The astronomy website EarthSky.org suggests the phrase originated not with astronomers, but with a Christian pastor named John Hagee and his 2013 book, \"Four Blood Moons: Something is about to change.\" \"\nAccording to Hagee's ministry website, the book \"explores the supernatural connection of certain celestial events to biblical prophecy.\" \"\nRegardless of whether or not you call it a blood moon, this lunar eclipse is definitely worth staying up late to see.\n \"I really urge everyone to watch the progress of this eclipse,\" MacRobert said.  \"Whether you have a small telescope, a pair of binoculars or even just your naked eye - you'll be seeing part of the geometry of the cosmos happening right in front of your eyes.\" \"",

It's known as a tetrad: four total lunar eclipses, one every six months starting tonight.  Meteorologists remain hopeful that pockets of clear sky over the city will provide periodic visibility.  \"It's not going to be a full overcast,\" said Tom Pepe with the National Weather Service.\n Here's how the astronomical event will play out: Around 10 p.m., the full moon will begin to rise over the jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains and enter a partial eclipse (unlike a solar eclipse, you can look without damaging your eyeballs).  A lunar eclipse means the sun, Earth and moon are aligned and the moon tucks into Earth's shadow, said Travis Rector, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Alaska Anchorage.  \"It will look a bit like Pac-Man at first,\" he said, referring to a shadow that will start to envelop a bright moon.  By 11:07 p.m., the moon will be completely dark, giving off a red-orange glow.  This total phase will last until around 12:30 a.m., Rector said.\n He advised people to look south.  \"The moon will be fairly low on the horizon,\" he said.  \"It's just simply this time of year.\" \"\nThis is the first total lunar eclipse since Dec. 10, 2011.  The next will be Oct. 8, then April 4, 2015, and Sept. 28, 2015.\n If the weather doesn't cooperate, here's good news: Slooh, on online community observatory, will have a live broadcast of the eclipse starting at 10 p.m.: http://events.slooh.com/stadium/total-lunar-eclipse-arizona-april-15-2014",

MacMillan Space Centre, located in Vancouver's Vanier Park.\n \"People may refer to this type of lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of its red hue.\" \"\n(The MacMillan centre is holding an evening program tonight in its planetarium, beginning at 8:45 p.m. The eclipse begins at 9:55 p.m., with the full eclipse beginning at 12:08 a.m. tomorrow morning.  The centre says the eclipse will end at 3:36 a.m.)\n\"Some people like to say it's sort of a blood-red moon,\" said Colin Haig of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, to the CBC, \"which has great emotional impact but it's not really blood colour - it's more of a coppery colour.\" \"\nSeveral lunar eclipses happen every year, although they can only be viewed by certain places on Earth, and the Earth's shadow - which causes the Moon's eclipse, blocking the Sun - sometime sonly touches part of the Moon.\n Tonight's eclipse kicks off a four-part eclipse series known as a lunar tetrad, says the Space Centre.\n \"It means it is one of four successive total lunar eclipses in a row without a partial eclipse in between, each of which is separated by six full moons.\" \"\nThe next eclipses will be: October 8, 2014; April 4, 2015; and September 28, 2015.\n Also occurring tonight (and throughout April) is the \"opposition\" of Mars, meaning the red planet will have its closest approach to Earth in 26 months - with the two planets only 92 million kilometres apart.\n This happens ever two years, when the Earth passes between Mars and the sun.\n The red planet will look 10 times brighter than it normally does from Earth, according to NASA (CBC).",

Kids who had never seen anything like it pointed in amazement as it began to turn a coppery hue.  Maximum eclipse was at 7.46pm, with totality ending at 8.23pm.\n Palmerston North Astronomical Society president Ian Cooper said the group were calling it ''the miracle of the 15th''.\n About 100 people, many of them parents with their children, turned out the the observatory at Anzac Park to watch the unexpected event, he said.\n ''When you look at how close the clouds were on the satellite and how they just rolled in straight after totality it's incredible that we got the view we did,'' he said.\n Cooper has not missed any of the 20 lunar eclipses since 1967 and said this one ranked right up there.\n ''It was excellent.  The interesting thing was that as far as blood moons go, this one was more yellowy-orange than red.  It was quite clean.  That happens - I've seen ones that are black which isn't much fun.  This one was probably pretty similar to one we had in 2007 or the big one back in 2000.' ''\nThe next total lunar eclipse for Manawatu to look forward to will be overnight on October 8/9, with mid-eclipse at 11.55pm.  The eclipse on April 4, 2015, will also be visible from this country, but that of September 28, 2015, would not be.\n MANAWATU'S BLOOD MOON TWEETS:\n@hapiharry Great shots of #bloodmoon by @GrumpyDarren pity his ladder climbing isn't so great.

Depending on your location, it begins either late tonight or in the wee hours of Tuesday, but as with every skywatching event, you can only see it if Mother Nature cooperates.\n Tonight's lunar eclipse runs from 12:53 a.m. EDT (0453 GMT) to about 6 a.m. EDT (1000 GMT).  If bad weather spoils your view, or you live in Europe or elsewhere outside the visibility zone, you can always watch live webcasts of the total lunar eclipse on Space.c com, courtesy of NASA, the Slooh community telescope, the Virtual Telescope Project.  [How to Watch Tonight's Total Lunar Eclipse]\nAlong the U.S. East Coast, a slow-moving cold front stretching from western New York State south-southwest into the central Gulf of Mexico is likely to bring considerable cloudiness to much of the eastern-third of the nation.  Generally speaking, anywhere east of a line extending from Sault Ste-Marie, Mich. to Paducah, Ky. to Baton Rouge, La. will have poor sky conditions for getting even a fleeting glimpse of the darkening moon during the predawn hours of Tuesday.\n The exception might be inland sections of central and south Florida where the clouds may be thin enough to allow for some visibility of the shady lunar drama.\n Showers and scattered thunderstorms -- a few possibly strong and gusty -- could bring as much as one-quarter to one-half inch of rain across parts of the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys, with as much as an inch over the Florida Panhandle, while snow will fall over parts of northwest Ohio and Michigan.\n Over the central and western United States, high pressure over the plains states is expected to bring mainly fair skies.  However a cold front draped over the Pacific Northwest into northern California, could bring some cloudiness that may hinder the view.  Near and along the coast of Washington State, spotty showers could fall, but for the most part, the western two-thirds of the United States will be dry, tranquil and perfect for viewing tonight's moon show.\n Lunar eclipses occur when the moon is in the full moon stage and passes through part or all of the Earth's shadow, darkening the moon's typically bright glow.  During a total lunar eclipse, the moon is entirely immersed in Earth shadow, and can take on a dusky \"blood red\" color due to the scattering of sunlight through the edges of Earth's atmosphere.  Such moons are sometimes nicknamed \"Blood Moons.\" \"\nTonight's lunar eclipse is the first of four consecutive total eclipses of the moon between April 2014 and September 2015 in what scientists call a lunar eclipse \"tetrad\" series.  The next total lunar eclipse will occur on Oct. 8 and is also expected to be visible from much of North America.\n For the very latest forecast for your local area, check the National Weather Service Forecast Offices.

A great celestial development is taking place and rare blood lunar eclipse is going to happen within hours from now.  And the best thing is the fact that the total lunar eclipse will be there for hours.\n But the fact that the eclipse in the United States will be visible only after midnight may be a bit unnerving for some.  So if you are eager to experience this rare eclipse tonight you will have to keep yourself awake.\n If you thought that you can get up after midnight to experience the eclipse, your chance of witnessing it are as good as zero except if you have the same rare determination as this lunar eclipse.  Most of the people cannot actually manage to get up despite setting alarm for midnight.  So it is always better to be ready for the occasion in the best way.\n Thankfully weather is going to be clear in most of the places across the US.  And in places where weather is not that clear, there is always Slooh to help you experience all the movements of the moon.  Slooh will be live streaming the occasion in the coming hours.\n This is one of the most awaited total lunar eclipses and people have been waiting for it for weeks if not months.  But the moon is going to be fully eclipsed at about 12:07 a.m. According to astronomers, eclipse maximum is at 12:46.  During this moment, the moon will enter the Earth's umbra.  And it is this time when there will be complete shadow.  That is not the end of the whole process.  As time passes, the moon will continue to get progressively darker.  It will move deeper into the umbra.\n Experts are giving their own advises to people interested in watching the lunar eclipse.  Joe Sirard, an amateur astronomer says, \"We'll have clear skies -- even down to the beaches...W We've got four in a row that we're going to be seeing here in North America, which is pretty nice...I It doesn't happen too often that we get to see that many in a row.\" \" This is enticing time.  And if you don't find weather very clear you can always opt for Slooh.C Com that will be live streaming the lunar eclipse.",

                    "body": "UNITED STATES (4/14/14) -- While some attribute certain human behaviors to a full moon, tonight's full moon will exhibit some unusual visual behavior on its own shortly after midnight.  Unfortunately, most western Kentuckians won't be able to see it well due to overcast and cloudy skies.\n Beginning at 1:20 a.m. Tuesday, April 15 on the east coast, a total lunar eclipse will begin.  A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth and moon are in direct line so that the Earth's shadow covers the moon.  This is the start of a rare sequence of four total lunar eclipses expected over the next two years.\n During a total eclipse, the moon appears a little darker than normal.  However, a darker arc will move across the moon with a distinct rusty, red hue.  The color of the moon during this time is often referred to as a \"Blood Moon\".\n The bloody color is the result of the refraction of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere.  It is the same effect that makes the sun appear reddish at sunset.\n This eclipse will also have another unique characteristic -- Mars will appear as a fiery red \"star\" next to the moon.  With the red shadow on the moon and the brilliant red of Mars, a great photo opportunity should be available to those with clear skies.\n Tuesday morning's eclipse is also the beginning of a lunar tetrad -- an event that occurs when there are four successive total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between.  Each of the four total eclipses are separated from each other by six full moons.\n The other three eclipses are on Oct. 8, 2014, April 8, 2015 and Sept. 28, 2015.  There will be a total of eight lunar tetrads between 2001 and 2100.\n Some biblical scholars are leaning toward prophecies being fulfilled while others are not.  In the Rev. John Hagee's book, \"Four Blood Moons: Something is About to Change,\" he says that changes are in store for Israel at this time.\n The best area for viewing the eclipse will be in the Mountain Time Zone from Texas to the Dakotas.\n Viewing from Kentucky will be poor at best and with the National Weather Service predicting 100 percent of precipitation through the night include a chance of light snow, it's doubtful it will be seen at all.\n Rita Dukes Smith\nSurfKY News Director",

At 10:25 p.m., the moon will leave the shadow of the Earth and begin to lighten.\n Monday's total lunar eclipse is the first of two that will occur in 2014.  The second total lunar eclipse will occur Oct. 7 with the partial phase starting at 11:14 p.m. and the total eclipse at occurring at 12:25 a.m. Oct. 8.\n In all, four eclipses will occur this year, two lunar and two solar.\n On April 29, the Southern Hemisphere will be treated to a rare type of solar eclipse.  A partial solar eclipse will occur Oct. 23.",

All you have to do is just step outside and look at the sky as the coppery red moon is gracing the skies in different phases between 2 a.m. ET and 4:30 a.m. ET.\n In Los Angeles, thousands of people gathered at the Griffith Observatory to view this phenomenon which happens when the sun, earth and moon all come in one line.\n Ed Krupp, director of the observatory, described it as a \" typical copper red\" total lunar eclipse.\n Though rare, it's the sky \"conspiring into a special event\" that draws crowds, he said.\n \"The fact that there are four lunar successions coming this year and next ... is unusual,\" Krupp said.  \"But it's not the kind of thing astronomers get worked up about .  It doesn't really mean anything.  It's a chance arrangement of gravity and the motions of objects in the solar system, primarily the Earth and moon.\" \"\nToday's lunar eclispse is the first in a series of four consecutive total lunar eclipses known as the tetrad.  The next eclipse will happen after six months.\n In a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears reddish as it passes behind the Earth into its umbra (shadow).  \"Since Earth's umbral shadow is darker in the center than at the edge, the moon's appearance will likely change dramatically with time as the total phase progresses,\" NASA said in a statement.\n \"The blood moon starts to change from its silver color as it slides into the Earth's shadow,\" it added.  The \"blood moon\" will appear totally at 3:07 a.m. ET and it will last till 4:24 a.m. ET.  This phenomenon will not be visible in India.",

People in central Australia will see the tail end of the eclipse, while those in Western Australia will miss out altogether.\n According to National Geographic, Lunar eclipses occur only when there is a full moon and the sun, Earth, and moon are precisely aligned for our planet's shadow to \"turn out the lunar lights.\" \"\n\"Just as the Sun is setting, the Moon will be rising, and it will be totally eclipsed, which should be fairly spectacular, Dr Nick Lomb, consultant astronomer and curator, Powerhouse Museum and Sydney Observatory told the ABC.\n He explained that because the eclipse will happen so low in the sky, to see it you will need to make sure there are no trees, hills or buildings in the way.  \"The essential thing is to have a really clear view towards the eastern horizon,\" he said.  The Sydney Observatory has listed their recommendations for the best local viewing times (below).\n Once the sun sets, \"it's a fair chance it will become a reasonably bright reddish Moon,\" said Lomb.  The reason the moon may appear red during the eclipse is because sunlight shining through the ring of Earth's dusty atmosphere is bent, or refracted, toward the red part of the spectrum and cast onto the moon's surface.\n The reddish colour is not always guaranteed however and can't be predicted as it is dependent on the amount of dust circulating in Earth's atmosphere at the time of the eclipse.  Skygazers will have to wait an see what the lunar gods have in store for tonight's show and unlike solar eclipses, the lunar eclipse phenomenon is perfectly safe to view and to photograph.\n The blood moons are part of a tetrad, a set of four complete and consecutive lunar eclipses that will begin on April 15 and continue in roughly six-month intervals until October 2015.  According to NASA, seeing four complete lunar eclipses in a row is very rare and the skies were tetrad-free from 1600 to 1900.\n Blood moons have been believed to be omens for many cultures throughout history.  According to New York Daily News, a popular televangelist from San Antonio, John Hagee, has stated that tonight's lunar eclipse is a sign that biblical prophecies are about to come true and are evidence of a future \"world-shaking event.\" \"\n\"Just as in biblical times, God is controlling the sun, the moon, and the stars to send our generation a signal that something big is about to happen.  The question is: Are we watching and listening to His message?,\" Hagee wrote in his book Four Blood Moons: Something Is About to Change.\n In 2008, Hagee faced fierce criticism for suggesting to NPR's Terry Gross that Hurricane Katrina was a result of God's wrath toward the city of New Orleans for planning a rally for gays and lesbians.",

                    "body": "A blood-red moon will hang close in the sky with the Red Planet Monday night, thanks to the chance coincidence of two rare astronomical phenomena.  The moon is due to fall under Earth's shadow that night (actually the early hours of Tuesday morning) in a total lunar eclipse, one of two such eclipses in 2014.  By fluke, Monday is also the date of Mars's closest approach to Earth, when our neighboring planet should appear larger and brighter than usual.\n Stargazers in North and South America should have a fine view of both events, weather permitting.  If you plan to catch the sight, consider snapping a photo and sharing it with us below.  We plan to post a gallery of the best shots at ScientificAmerican.com on Tuesday.\n Total lunar eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and the full moon align in a row, with Earth in the middle.  When the moon passes directly through Earth's shadow, sunlight cannot reach it directly, so it doesn't shine as usual.  The moon doesn't disappear, either, however, because some of the sun's light reaches it indirectly, after being bent around the edges of Earth through our planet's atmosphere.  This effect causes the moon to glow a coppery red, for the same reason that sunsets are crimson-hued: When light travels through the thickest part of Earth's atmosphere, blue light is scattered but red shines through.\n The lunar eclipse show will begin around 2 a.m. EDT on Tuesday (April 15), and last about three hours.  The moment of totality, when the moon is perfectly aligned in the center of Earth's shadow, called the umbra, occurs at 3:45 a.m. EDT.\n Whether you're a veteran skywatcher or a novice stargazer, a total lunar eclipse is a sight to see.  It's easy to spot, visually stunning, and poses no hazard to you (in contrast to a solar eclipse, which requires safety viewing equipment).  Plus, for viewers in North and South America, this eclipse presents a rare chance to see it from start to finish during our nighttime hours.  The next time a total lunar eclipse will be viewable by the entire continent is in 2019.\n Add to that the close alignment of the extra-bright Mars, and you've got a sight not to be missed.  The Red Planet will hang just north of the moon in the sky, separated by a scant three degrees, in front of the constellation Virgo.",

The next total lunar eclipse will be October 8, followed by the two in 2015 on April 4 and September 28.  Oddly enough, there were no blood moons during the 300-year period just prior to the beginning of the 20th century, according to NASA expert Fred Espenak.\n Earth casts a long shadow far into space, well beyond the moon's orbit, and when the moon passes through the most dense part of that shadow, it is a total lunar eclipse.  Fortunately, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye, unlike solar eclipses.\n During the extended time period, the moon's bright glow dims and takes on a reddish hue.  As the moon gradually emerges from the shadow, the ruddy tint fades with the increasing brightness until it transitions back to the regular silver appearance.  The bright bluish star Spica of the constellation Virgo, only a few degrees lower and to the right of the eclipsed moon during the totality stage, was more conspicuous than usual.\n Joe Rao, skywatching columnist for www.space.com, explains how the moon is visible in first place when it has been totally eclipsed, writing, \"...sunlight is scattered and refracted around the edge of Earth by the planet's atmosphere.  To an astronaut standing on the moon during totality, the sun would be hidden behind a dark earth outlined by a brilliant red ring consisting of all the world's sunrises and sunsets.  The brightness of this ring around Earth depends on global weather conditions and the amount of dust suspended in the air.  A clear atmosphere on Earth means a bright lunar eclipse.  If a major volcanic eruption has injected particles into the stratosphere, the eclipse is very dark.\" \"",

He showed us what to expect -- the moon will be red and that scares some people.\n Basically what's going on is the sun light is passing through to the Earth's atmosphere.  The blue light gets scattered and left with nothing but red light that falls on the Earth, making it look right,\" explained George.\n You don't need any special equipment or glasses to see the lunar eclipse Monday night.\n If you miss it, not to worry -- there will be another one in October and it will be just as spectacular.  In 2015, there will be more in April and September.\n Having four lunar eclipses this close together doesn't happen very often.\n For the best view, set your alarms around midnight -- that's when the show begins and lasts about 3.5 hours.",

Holly office.  North Jersey and the Poconos are expected to see snow, while South Jersey will see three-quarters of an inch to an inch to an inch-and-three-quarters of rain.\n During the penumbra - the first phase of a total lunar eclipse - a dark shadow will slowly cover the moon.  The eclipse will peak at about 3:45 a.m., at which point the moon will enter the Earth's full shadow, or umbra.  Red light from the sun will then reflect off the moon's surface, causing it to take on a red color.\n A total lunar eclipse occurs when the earth, moon and sun are in perfect alignment.  Such eclipses occur multiple times per year during the full moon, but are rarely visible from start to finish in North America.

We're going to bend the light from the sun around the Earth.\" \"\nClouds that moved into much of the area Monday afternoon were parting around nightfall, boosting the odds of great viewing conditions.\n Grossfeld said North Americans typically view full lunar eclipses every couple of years, but he also said there's been times in history when humans didn't see a single one for hundreds of years.\n Luckily, over the next year and a half, we're getting spoiled.\n \"We'll have one tonight of course, then one in October, then next year we have one in April and then one in September,\" Grossfeld said.  \"So we will have four total lunar eclipses, so that's kind of unusual.\" \"\nYou can catch the action Monday night around 11 p.m. Grossfeld said people will see the full effect shortly after midnight.\n The Oregon Observatory is hosting a free viewing party Monday night at its location off River Road in Sunriver from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.\n\"You see it in a book, and that's cool, but when you see it in real life, it's totally different,\" Grossfeld said.",

On rare occasions, the light reaching the moon is exactly the color of blood, but there is no way of predicting this in advance.  So there are no grounds to call any particular lunar eclipse a blood moon until it actually shows its color.\n The lunar eclipse coincides with April's full moon and is the first of four total lunar eclipse (a tetrad) between April 2014 and September 2015.  As per Ajay market theory this lunar eclipse may bring highest volatility in Indian stock and commodity market and also warn capital market due to domestic and international reasons.\n It is important to note that this lunar eclipse is taking place in Libra; Sun and Moon both are under influence of Rahu and Ketu.  When there is total lunar eclipse in series as per financial astrology it is not very favorable for political leaders.\n April month is very important month for Indian and global politics.  Results of 15th Lok Sabha are expected to surprise not only public but also political leaders.  Traders need to careful in their big positions in stock market.\n Small traders need to keep away from stock market or need to hedge their buying positions in stock market for month of May 2014.

That way you'll get the full view.  You will get the full picture of what's going on,\" said Miles.\n A total lunar eclipse was last visible from earth in 2011.\n It happens when the moon slips into the shadow of the earth.\n Light from the sun then bends around the earth's atmosphere making the moon appear blood red.\n \"If you have cloudy conditions on the earth's edge, that would block the earth's light and you won't see the moon at all,\" said Miles.\n Miles says if you want to see the show, be outside by 2 AM.\n Between two and about 3:30 AM thirty, you're likely see to see that reddish glow.\n Whether you're a passionate stargazer or just find yourself looking into the sky from time to time, it's a special sight.\n \"It's a rare event.  It's really neat to see that,\" Miles told Channel 13 News.\n If you need a little expert guidance viewing the lunar eclipse, head to the Science Center of Iowa late Monday night or early Tuesday morning.\n Miles will be out with his telescopes from 11 PM when the moon begins to slip into the earth's shadow until about 4 AM when the total eclipse ends.",

That glow is actually from the Earth's atmosphere bending light back toward the moon's surface.  The nice poetic way to put it, it's all the sunrises and sunsets around the earth that are actually getting focused back onto the moon's surface.\" \"\nBut unfortunately, the viewing looks bad from the Tri-State.\n Tri-State viewing will be from about 2-5:30 a.m. Tuesday, but cloudy skies are expected throughout that time period.\n But according to astronomer Dr. Wes Ryle at Thomas More College, that isn't unusual.\n \"Lunar eclipses usually happen about twice a year, but you have to be in the right place at the right time to be able to see it.  The last one that would have been visible in Cincinnati was a little over two years ago, but even then it was cloudy for that one, so you have to actually go back to more than six years since we had one visible in Cincinnati,\" Ryle said.\n Thomas More College had planned a camp out and viewing party for the eclipse at The Bank of Kentucky Observatory on campus, but those events have been canceled due to the weather.\n The best option to enjoy the eclipse in real-time will be viewing it online.\n Live Streaming of the lunar eclipse:\nwww.stargazersonline.org\nwww.griffithobservatory.com\nThe Bank of Kentucky Observatory at Thomas More College holds free Open Houses several times a semester.

We have been teased with a few mild days and a few days of sunshine, but we have a ways to go before spring has really sprung.\n I hope the weather cooperated for the total lunar eclipse taking place Monday night.  Since I write this column a week in advance, I don't know what the weather will hold, but I sure hope the eclipse was visible.  The full moon is today, Tuesday, so lunar observing gradually improves in the next week or so as a sharp line and good contrast appears between the lit and unlit areas of the moon.  Use binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the lunar landscape.  On April 25, 1990, the Hubble telescope was deployed.  It's hard to believe that Hubble has been around more than 23 years.  Probably no telescope in history is as well known or has enriched and educated so many people.  Hopefully, it will be around for at least another five to eight years, but with government funding always shaky, it may be touch and go.",
