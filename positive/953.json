Orshan and Endara were driven to further irritation when Apple's suggested solution to their newfound lack of storage involved \"aggressively\" marketing its iCloud storage service.\n\n\"Using these sharp business tactics, [Apple] gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment, e.g., when a consumer is trying to record or take photos at a child or grandchild's recital, basketball game or wedding,\" reads the complaint.\n\nApple, which is yet to comment on the complaint, faced a similar suit in 2007 when a Canadian law student sued the company for misleading him over the amount of storage available on his iPod Nano.

When users reach their storage limit faster than anticipated, Apple gadgets direct them to purchase additional space via the company's iCloud service.\n\nPer The Mercury News, plaintiffs are seeking damages and changes to Apple's policies under California state law. The lawsuit states that the software all but requires users to buy into Apple's iCloud storage system.\n\n\"Using these sharp business tactics, defendant gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment, e.g., when a consumer is trying to record or take photos at a child or grandchild's recital, basketball game or wedding,\" the plaintiffs stated in the complaint.\n\nThe new software comes standard on all new Apple devices and is available as an upgrade to users of older products.

They are seeking more than $5 million in damages for what they say is Apple's false advertising.\n\nApple's new iOS 8 software takes up 3 GB of storage on an iPhone 6. That's 19% of the phone's 16 GB of advertised storage. The iOS 8 software takes up 20% of an iPhone 6 Plus' storage and 21% of an iPad's free space.\n\n\"Apple's misrepresentations and omissions are deceptive and misleading because they omit material facts that an average consumer would consider in deciding whether to purchase its products,\" the plaintiffs say in their complaint.\n\nRather than try to cram everything into what little space they have on their smartphones, many people choose to back up their photos, videos and other content on cloud services, such as Apple's iCloud. But the plaintiffs say that's all part of Apple's game.\n\n\"Apple exploits the discrepancy between represented and available capacity for its own gain by offering to sell, and by selling, cloud storage capacity to purchasers whose internal storage capacity is at or near exhaustion,\" the complaint says.\n\nThis is not the first time Apple has been sued for misleading customers about storage space. In 2007, angry iPod Nano customers filed a lawsuit against Apple for only providing 7.45 GB of storage in their 8 GB iPods (less than 7% for those scoring at home). That case was ultimately dismissed.\n\nOther companies have faced similar lawsuits. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) was sued in 2012 for falsely advertising the amount of storage available to Surface tablet customers. But those tablets, which run the much more data-intensive Windows operating system, actually have less than half their 32 GB of advertised storage available for customers' use.",

But are the iPhone 6 Plus deals already giving users the experience they should expect, despite allegations to the contrary?\n\nIn a related report by the Inquisitr, one of Walmart's iPhone 6 Plus deals was so good that one man apparently felt the need to boil his iPhone in Coke. If the iPhone 6 Plus screen size is way too big for your hand, then you might be interested in the latest iPhone 7 rumors since it's believed Apple may release an iPhone 6S Mini in the first of half of 2015.\n\nThe Apple lawsuit decided to end the year with a bang. No fireworks were involved, but the lawsuit lit a fire under the company in the last week of 2014. The major complaint is that Apple allegedly failed \"to disclose to consumers that as much as 23.1 percent of the advertised storage capacity of the devices will be consumed by iOS 8 and unavailable for consumers.\" According to Courthouse News, they put this iPhone 6 Plus lawsuit into context by claiming that \"each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high resolution photographs,\" which may cause the storage limits to be hit at the worst moment.\n\n\"To compound the harm to consumers, after Defendant provides materially less than the advertised capacity on the Devices, Defendant aggressively markets a monthly-fee-based storage system called iCloud. Using these sharp business tactics, Defendant gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment, e.g., when a consumer is trying to record or take photos at a child or grandchild's recital, basketball game or wedding.\"\n\nThere are several reason to not buy these complaints about the iPhone 6 Plus memory capacity. This particular smartphone issue is not unique to Apple, since both Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows Mobile also tend to consume a hefty amount of internal memory. It should also be highlighted how both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus memory options include up to 128GB in space, while competitors often max at around 32GB for internal memory. For example, only 8.65GB of storage is available to users that buy the Samsung Galaxy S5.\n\nDo you think this Apple lawsuit makes a good argument against the current iPhone 6 Plus memory capacity limitations?",

They're particularly angry that users are not allowed to go back to iOS7 if they don't like iOS8, and that customers only option to receive more storage on their phone is to buy access to the iCloud service.

The tech giant has been accused of misrepresenting the amount of storage on its popular iPhone in a class-action lawsuit filed in a California court, reports Apple Insider. The lawsuit claims Apple did not disclose how much storage space would be consumed when iPhone owners installed the company's latest operating system, iOS 8. The suit also claims Apple is limiting storage to sell more users on iCloud upgrades.\n\nGoPro. The roller-coaster ride for the high-definition camera maker continues. Shares GPRO ended up 5.8% on the first day of trading in 2015, after ending 2014 with declines of more than 3%. Since December 19, GoPro shares have added $10 in value.\n\nTwitter. The social network has started rolling out a new features called \"while you were away,\" reports TechCrunch. The feature updates users on tweets they missed while not connected to Twitter.\n\nYahoo. How's this for an interesting Yahoo acquisition: Business Insider reports CEO Marissa Mayer considered buying the cable channel Scripps Networks Interactive. Yahoo has participated in a buying frenzy since Mayer took over, highlighted by the $1.1 billion deal to acquire Tumblr.\n\nSony. The company says it will offer discounts and trial extensions for online service PlayStation Network for an outage that knocked out the service for Christmas Day and several days later.
