In a series of video clips, Tim Cook talks about Steve Jobs, Apple's Beats Electronics acquisition, the Apple TV, and Apple's plans for the future.\n\nIn the first clip, Cook again comments on Steve Jobs' ongoing influence at Apple, saying Jobs is in his heart and deep in Apple's DNA. \"His spirit will always be the foundation of the company,\" says Cook. Cook also gives one other interesting tidbit about Jobs -- his fourth floor office has remained untouched since his passing.\n\nIn a second clip, Cook says the hardest decisions Apple makes \"are all the things not to work on.\" When asked if television is one of those areas, Cook said that TV is an area that Apple \"continues to have great interest in.\" He went on to say that TV is one of those things \"stuck back in the 70s,\" and he admits that with 20 million users, the Apple TV has \"far exceeded the hobby label.\" Cook didn't divulge any details on the future of the Apple TV however, stating just that it's an area that Apple continues to look at.\n\nIn the third and final clip, Cook spoke on Apple's decision to buy Beats, reiterating many of the reasons behind the acquisition. \"Jimmy and Dre are off the charts creative geniuses,\" said Cook, pointing towards Iovine's knowledge of the music industry and Dre's connection to artists. He also said that Beats Music's human curation was a major factor in the acquisition.\n\nThe complete first part of Tim Cook's Charlie Rose interview will air later tonight on PBS, with the second part of the interview airing on Monday night.",

But he did express some dissatisfaction with the status quo, as he has before. \"The interface is terrible! I mean, it's awful,\" Cook said. \"And you watch things when they come on unless you remember to record them.\"\n\n\"So why don't you fix that?\" Rose asked.\n\n\"Well -- yeah -- you know, I don't want to get into what we're doing in the future,\" he said. Then he explained the progress Apple has had with the Apple TV box.\n\nThe first part of Rose's interview will be shown on PBS on Friday night. It comes at the end of a busy week for the usually press-shy Cook.\n\nRepeating what he said at a press unveiling of the Apple Watch and the iPhone 6 on Tuesday, Cook called the new phones \"the biggest advance in iPhone history.\"\n\nHe also spoke in the interview about his time with the company's founder Steve Jobs.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\nOn Steve Jobs: \"His spirit will always be at the foundation of the company. I literally think about him every day,\" Cook said. \"If you think about the thing that Steve stood for at a macro level, he stood for innovation, he stood for the simple, not the complex...The fact that despite this table being so small that you and I are sitting at, you could put every Apple product on it, every single one we ship today, and yet this year our revenues will be approximately $180 billion. There's probably no other company on the face of the earth that can say that.\"\n\nCook gives a great tidbit about how Apple has maintained Job's fourth-floor office since his death in 2011: \"His office is still left as it was... his name is still on the door.\" As far as living up to Jobs' enormous legacy, Cook said that was never his \"objective\", saying, \"I've always been trying to be the best Tim Cook I could be.\"\n\nConcerning buying headphones manufacturer Beats, Cook explained that in the company he saw \"talent\" and saw Dr. Dre and Jimmy Lovine as \"creative geniuses.\" Yet, he was skeptical of Beats' streaming service until he tried for himself and felt \"completely different\" compared to other subscription services on the market.\n\nThe second half of Cook's interview with Rose will air Monday Night on PBS.\n\nRecommended",

Can he reach into the future?\"\n\nCook answered Rose by explaining how Jobs had asked him to be CEO in August 2011.\n\nBy that time Jobs' health had deteriorated. He was living at home while Cook served as an interim-CEO.\n\nSo when Jobs called Cook and asked him to come over, he knew it was important.\n\nBut he didn't know what Jobs had in mind.\n\n\"And he told me -- he said, 'I've been thinking a lot. Apple has never had a professional transition at CEO. I'm determined that we will have one now. I want you to be the CEO.' And honestly, I didn't see it coming,\" said Cook.\n\nCook was taken aback by Jobs' timing.\n\n\"I always knew it was his long-term thinking,\" he said. \"That I would become the CEO. But not then.\"\n\nCook told Rose that Jobs knew he was not picking a carbon copy of himself to lead Apple into the future.\n\n\"But, in terms of being everything he was, I've never had that objective,\" said Cook. \"I've never had the objective of being like him, because I knew, the only person I can be is the person I am.\"",

                    "body": "Last night, part one of Apple CEO Tim Cook's interview with Charlie Rose was aired on the journalist's namesake TV show. Prior to its airing, the interview was teased with several short clips on YouTube. But now, you can watch the first part of the interview online on the official \"Charlie Rose\" website or Hulu, whose video of the program is embedded below.\n\nThe interview begins with Cook talking about the three new products he introduced at last Tuesday's Apple keynote: the iPhone 6, the iPhone 6 Plus, and the Apple Watch. He touts the new smartphones as the \"biggest advancement ever in iPhone history\" and the smart watch as Apple's \"most personal\" product yet.\n\nHe admits that neither the iPhone nor the Apple Watch is the first in its category. But he points out that Apple is not concerned about being the first, but rather about being the best -- or as noted in Apple's \"Perspective\" video, about being the first that \"actually matters.\"\n\nCook also touts Apple Pay, the new mobile payment platform unveiled by Apple alongside its new products.\n\nHe goes on to discuss Apple's HealthKit platform, Apple TV, focus on emerging markets like China, acquisition of Beats, and partnership with IBM.\n\nAccording to Cook, while Samsung is the \"best of the hardware companies in the Android sphere,\" Google is Apple's top competitor. He also says that Apple has \"little relationship\" with Amazon. Facebook and Twitter, on the other hand, are both partners of Apple, which apparently has no plans of being in the social networking business (Ping, anyone?).\n\nCook notably assumes a more thoughtful, even wistful, manner every time his predecessor, the late Apple cofounder and CEO Steve Jobs, becomes the topic of discussion. \"Well, he's in my heart, and he's deep in Apple's DNA,\" Cook says the first time. \"His spirit will always be the foundation of the company.\" He asserts, however, that he has no objective of being like Jobs, who chose him in 2011 as the leader of the company he joined in 1998.\n\nIf you can't see the video embedded above, please click here.\n\nThe interview also touches upon a couple of controversies Apple has been involved in.\n\nFirst, the great Apple Maps fiasco of 2012, about which Cook says, \"Oh, we screwed up, to put it bluntly.\" Of course, Apple's mapping software has been significantly improved since its initial failure, for which Cook personally apologized.\n\n\"And you know, sometimes, when you're running fast, you slip and you fall,\" Cook says in the interview. \"And I think the best thing you can do is get back up and say, 'I'm sorry.' And you try to remedy the situation, and you work like hell to make the product right. If you're probably never making a mistake, you're probably not doing enough.\"\n\nSecond, there's the recent nude celebrity photo leak that has been largely blamed on a so-called iCloud hack. On this subject, Cook is quick to clarify that Apple's cloud service was not breached during the incident. Rather, only individual accounts were hacked via password guessing or phishing.\n\nPart two of the interview is scheduled to be aired on Monday, Sept. 15. Rose teases the second part at the end of the first, suggesting that it includes Cook's answer to the question, \"What comes after the Internet?\"\n\nPerhaps the answer has to do with one of the things Cook says in part one of the interview: \"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about, yes. That haven't been rumored about yet, yes. And part of some of those are going to come out and be blow-away, probably.\"",

His spirit will always be the foundation of the company,\" Cook explained. \"I literally think about him every day.\"\n\nPressed for details, Cook said Apple's main takeaways from Jobs was his constant striving for perfection, and his desire to only produce the best products.\n\n\"If you think about the things that Steve stood for, at a macro level, he stood for innovation. He stood for the simple, not the complex. He knew that Apple should only enter areas where we can control the primary technology. All of these things are still deep in our company,\" Cook said.\n\nWhile Jobs' office has been a shrine these past three years, however, it may not remain so for long. Apple is building a new 2.8 million square-foot headquarters at a different location in Cupertino. It remains to be seen whether Cook will have the contents of Jobs' office transferred to the spaceship-like building and reinstalled in place.\n\nRose's full interview with Cook will air in two parts, with the first screening on Friday and the second on Monday, September 15. Air times vary depending on region and local PBS affiliate station. \u00ae",

                    "body": "Like his predecessor, Apple chief executive Tim Cook remains tight-lipped, and doesn't let anything slip he doesn't want out there.\n\nApple remains one of the most secretive companies in the world, let alone in the U.S. technology scene. And taking a leaf out of Steve Jobs' book, he very rarely talks on camera -- and even then, he seems guarded about what his company is up to.\n\nIn a two-part interview with PBS' Charlie Rose -- airing Friday, with the second-part landing Monday, the Apple boss spoke about Jobs, the company's products, secrecy, rivalries, and when things don't always go as planned.\n\nPBS shared a copy of the interview's transcript with ZDNet.\n\nHere's what we learned:\n\nOn building a larger iPhone:\n\nMany thought Apple building a larger iPhone was a response to the company's patent spat with Samsung, its long-time rival.\n\nAccording to Cook:\n\n\"We could have done a larger iPhone years ago. It's never been about just making a larger phone. It's been making -- it's been about making a better phone in every single way. And so we ship things when they're ready, and we think that both the display technology here, the battery technology, but all -- but everything else and the software...\n\nAnd so the ingenuity here and the fact that we've integrated software, hardware, and services which I think only Apple can do -- this phone -- now is the time for it.\"\n\nHe went on to explain that, as with the iPod and the iPad -- two products which weren't first but in one case pushed the music industry to a new level and the other carving out the mainstream tablet market -- Apple's philosophy's always been \"to be the best, not the first.\"\n\nOn building a health-based service\n\nCook suggested the thread that ties together its new health platform, dubbed HealthKit, is the products it launched on Tuesday -- the two new larger iPhones, and its new wearable.\n\nFor Apple, the monetary factor comes with \"enrich[ing] people's lives,\" Cook said. \"Neither one is sufficient by itself. We want to do both,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, we've also got a device that gathers certain fitness data about you. And yet -- so, this is yet another way to begin to build a comprehensive view of your life, which should empower you to take care of yourself over time. And when you need help, it empowers you to take certain data to your doctor to get help from them. All while guarding your privacy so that nobody getting the data -- if you don't want them to have the data, nobody sharing the data, if you don't want them to share the data.\n\nOn Steve Jobs and his immortalized office\n\nIt may seem corny to some, or heartfelt to others. Jobs, who died the day after Apple launched the iPhone 4s and iCloud in October 2011, is \"in my heart,\" Cook said. \"And he's deep in Apple's DNA.\"\n\nMany Apple watchers have kept a close eye on the company over the years. Jobs, the innovator, compared to Cook, the business man -- thanks to his roots as Apple's former chief operating officer -- couldn't be more different. And yet, Jobs trusted Cook to run the company after he knew he would not recover from his illness.\n\nCook said Jobs' office, on the fourth floor of Apple's headquarters, \"is still left as it was,\" immortalized long after he died.\n\n\"His name is still on the door. And we still -- if you think about the things that Steve stood for, at a macro level, he stood for innovation,\" Cook said.\n\nJust three months before Jobs died, Cook recounted how the conversation went when Cook heard he would become the company's chief.\n\n\"...He called me one weekend in August 2011. And he said, 'I'd like to talk.' And I said, 'Oh, okay.' And I go \"When?\" And he goes, 'Now.' I go, 'Yeah, I'll be right over.'\n\nAnd he told me -- he said, 'I've been thinking a lot. Apple has never had a professional transition at CEO. I'm determined that we will have one now. I want you to be the CEO.'\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't see it coming.\n\nI felt Steve was getting better. He was still at home, but I felt he was getting better. I was seeing him regularly. And I guess, at the end of the day, I always thought he would bounce. He always had. He had some incredible lows in his health, and it had always bounced. And I always believed he would. And so, it took me a little by surprise for that.\n\nOn the Apple-IBM deal\n\nAnother surprise under the Cook leadership was the announced collaboration between Apple and IBM.\n\nA deal that could have only happened under Cook, partly since Jobs' had a long-standing grudge against his former archrival, it would see the two companies extend into the enterprise market -- one Apple had never purposefully set foot in and needed help with.\n\nCook said:\n\n\"I think, IBM is, that's a great one to talk about for mine because I think it will give you an insight into how we look at things and we -- this is probably different than the past. We look at these products and the iPads that aren't here and we think we can change the way people work.\n\nBut when you get to the working environment, the change that we've made, to us, isn't significant enough. And so we begin to ask ourselves why. Why haven't we done more?\n\nAnd the real answer is in the applications. There are not enough apps that have been written for verticals, for very deep verticals, like what the airline pilot does. What the bank teller does. Down at the level of the job and so we begin to ask ourselves should we do this or should we partner or should we just forget it?\"\n\nApple is set to bring out more than one hundred custom-built apps with IBM later this year, extending into next, built on IBM's software and cloud stacks.\n\nIBM chief executive Ginni Rometty previously said mobility, data, and cloud is \"transforming business and our industry in historic ways,\" and changing how the workplace operates. Cook reiterated this:\n\n\"I mean, most of our life is spent working. And certainly our apps are changing the way I work, but I'm not seeing it as much in other places. And so we begin looking out and thinking about, 'Well, who could we partner with?' And Ginni and I have been talking about some other things for a while. I have great respect for her, great trust of her.\"\n\nHe also expanded a little on how the deal would work. Apple brings the user experience and device support, while IBM offers the enterprise app goodness with the 'sponsored' on-site AppleCare for their customers.\n\nCook called the deal a \"perfect marriage,\" but didn't underplay how much Apple needs IBM to engage with its new-found customer base.\n\n\"IBM brings significant enterprise knowledge to the table. We bring the products that enterprise want, and so we have something they don't have. We also don't compete on anything. To me, this is the perfect marriage. There's no friction.\n\nAnd so this is an area where I think that everybody's going to win. We're going to win, IBM's going to win, and more importantly than both of us, the customer's going to win.\"\n\nOn competition and rivalries\n\nIBM used to be a major rival, and now Apple's working with the company. Microsoft and Apple have had a long-standing fractious relationship, but are now closer than ever.\n\nAnd while everyone is looking at the Apple v. Samsung court cases, you would think the new rival in Apple's world was clear.\n\nNot so much, Cook explained. \"Google,\" he said, and not directly Samsung. He said Google supplies Samsung with Android, likening it to a food-chain diagram.\n\n\"Google is the -- it would be the top. And then they enable many people in the hardware business -- like Samsung. And Samsung is the best of the hardware companies in the Android sphere.\"\n\nHe said in respect to other Silicon Valley technology giants, \"We partner with both Facebook and Twitter,\" adding that Apple was \"not in the social networking business.\" That's a far cry away from Apple's only real failure in recent history, its iTunes-based Ping social network, which shut down two years ago.\n\n\"We like both companies,\" Cook said.\n\nBut regarding Amazon, which recently launched its own Fire smartphone, ramping up its competition efforts with Apple, Cook noted the \"little relationship\" between the two companies.\n\n\"You know? Amazon, we don't work with that much. We have little relationship there. They sell -- as you know... they've come up with a phone. You don't see it in a lot of places. They have some tablets. But they're not a product company. Apple is a product company. And so, in the long term, will they become a bigger product company? I don't know. You would have to ask Jeff [Bezos] what his plans are. But when I think of competitor, I would think of Google... much above anyone else.\"\n\nOn screwing up and eating humble pie\n\nDuring Cook's first year as chief executive, he maintained much of the same quality in the company's products and services as Jobs did during his tenure.\n\nBut there was one problem that derailed Cook's short, but unbroken record. Apple Maps, which he personally apologized for, after it fell significantly short of expectations. In some cases, Apple's homebrewed mapping service was just wrong, underdeveloped, or would direct cars into oceans.\n\n\"Oh, we screwed up,\" he said, putting it bluntly.\n\n\"There are many screw ups in that one. There's just not one. There's many. And we've learned and corrected and are continuing to invest in Maps, because our fundamental premise that maps were really key to Apple is the same is when that -- when we made that call many years ago.\n\nBut we did screw up on the release. It should not have happened like it did. It shouldn't have come out. And you know, sometimes, when you're running fast, you slip and you fall. And I think the best thing you can do is get back up and say, 'I'm sorry.'\n\nAnd you try to remedy the situation, and you work like hell to make the product right. If you're probably never making a mistake, you're probably not doing enough.\"\n\nOn secrecy and doubling-down on new products\n\nApple wasn't first with its wearable Apple Watch effort. But it hopes to be the best, as Cook has said previously. The company has been dining out on its iPhone effort while its iPad revenue stream begins to slow down. Its software and services, thanks in part to iTunes, is getting stronger every quarter.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAccording to Cook, there are new products in the pipeline that even the best Apple reporters and fans haven't even considered yet. But it's not to say they will all see the light of day.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about, yes. That haven't been rumored about yet. Yes. And part of some of those are going to come out and be blow-away, probably.\n\nAnd some of those we'll probably decide, 'You know, that one we're going to stop.' And so, we kick around a lot of things internally. And we might start something and get down the road a little bit, and have a different idea.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nApple's iPhone 6, Watch revealed: roundup Apple announces iPhone 6: Better specs, new features, larger screen sizes Apple said to be preparing larger iPad for 2015: Could it drive vital enterprise growth?

                    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook began working for the company in 1998. He was recruited by Steve Jobs from Compaq, where he was perfectly content. But Apple was persistent about Cook coming in for an interview, so Cook caved. Cook tells Charlie Rose how he wound up at Apple. During his one-on-one meeting with Jobs, Cook learned about the company's desire to enter the consumer space. Jobs also described a wonder computer Apple was working on but hadn't yet released, the iMac. The iMac was the first hit product Jobs launched when he returned as Apple's CEO in 1997. It's been credited for helping turn around the entire company after Apple nearly went bankrupt in the 90s.\n\nCook also felt like he and Jobs would work well together, so he followed his gut and went to work for Apple.\n\n\"All of a sudden I thought, 'I'm doing it. I'm going for it,'\" Cook tells Rose. \"And you have this voice in your ear that says, 'Go west young man, go west.'\"\n\nHow Jobs convinced him to join Apple in a recent interview:\n\nCharlie Rose: I mentioned at the beginning interview, the fact, when you made a decision in 1998 about Apple. You had some reservations. But at the same time, during your interview with Steve, you said, something like this, I was prepared within five minutes to throw caution to the wind. What did he say that made you believe this company is the place for Tim Cook?\n\nTim Cook: It was an interesting meeting. I had gotten a call several times from the search people that he had employed. And I said no, I was at Compaq, I was happy and, or thought I was. And they were persistent. And so I finally thought, I'm going to go out and take the meeting. Steve created the whole industry that I'm in, I'd love to meet him. And so I'm honestly going into the meeting.\n\nCR: There's no downside of this.\n\nTC: Well I'm just thinking I'm going to meet him and all of a sudden he's talking about his strategy and his vision, and what he was doing was going 100 percent into consumer. When everybody else in the industry had decided you couldn't make any money on consumers so they were headed to services and storage and enterprise. And I thought, I'd always thought that following the herd was not a good thing, that it was a terrible thing to do right? You're either going to lose big, or lose, but those are the two options. He was doing something totally different.\n\nAnd he told me a little about the design, enough to get me really interested. And he was describing what later would be called the iMac. And the way that he talked, and the way the chemistry was in the room, it was just he and I. And I could tell, I can work with him.\n\nAnd I looked at the problems Apple had, and I thought you know, I can make a contribution here. And working with him, and this is a privilege of a lifetime. And so all of a sudden I thought, I 'm doing it. I'm going for it. And you have this voice in your ear that says go west young man, go west. I was young at the time. But you know, you come back and you try to do the things that people do with spreadsheets and stuff, and none of it makes sense. It didn't make sense. And yet, my gut said, go for it. And I listened to my gut. There was literally no one around me that was inviting doing it.",

Same has been the case with Apple's tablets. But as it turns out there's work going on in Cupertino on devices that the rumor mill hasn't even heard about, this comes straight from company CEO Tim Cook.\n\nIn a recent interview with Charlie Rose, Apple CEO Tim Cook talked about various topics which included Apple's competition with Google, the legacy of co-founder and Cook's predecessor Steve Jobs as well as the future of TV.\n\nDuring the interview Cook said that Apple is working on products \"that haven't been rumored about yet.\" However he did not elaborate exactly what these products are. Earlier this year when Cook mentioned that the company will be entering into new product categories later this year almost everyone expected that he was talking about the smartwatch, AppleWatch is proof that indeed he was.\n\nWhen Charlie Rose asking about the TV market Cook didn't really come out and say that its an area that Apple is really looking at, however he did remark that TV is \"stuck back in the '70s.\" There have been countless rumors about an Apple HDTV which analysts now believe won't hit the market until late 2015. What Apple fans would be most interested in now are the products that haven't been rumored as yet, sadly there's no credible information on what Cupertino's R&D department is cooking up.\n\nThe second part of Cook's interview with Charlie Rose will be aired tomorrow.",

The strive for perfection, for being the best, for only doing the best products, for staying focussed.\"\n\n\"The fact that despite this table being so small that you and I are sitting at, you could put every Apple product on it. Every single one that we ship today and yet this year our revenues will be approximately $180 billion. There's probably no other company on the face of the earth that could say that.\"\n\nIn another clip, Cook explains how the human curation element of Beats' music streaming service convinced him that the offering was different from the competition.\n\nThe final clip has Cook saying that the experience of watching TV is still stuck in the 70s, and if Apple is working on a solution.",

But not Apple boss Tim Cook, who has warned that the goggle box is stuck in a time warp so intense that watching it is like being sucked back back into the 1970s.\n\nIn an interview with American talkshow host Charlie Rose, Cook dropped a clanging clue to his company's future direction whilst slagging off the state of the telly industry.\n\n\"TV is one that we continue to have great interest in - I choose my words carefully there - TV is one of those things that, if we're really honest, it's stuck back in the seventies,\" said Cook.\n\n\"Think about how much your life has changed, and all the things around you that have changed. And yet TV, when you go in your living room to watch the TV, or wherever it might be, it almost feels like you're rewinding the clock and you've entered a time capsule and you're going backwards. The interface is terrible. I mean, it's awful!\"\n\nThe fruity f\u00fchrer has whipped the Apple faithful into a feverish state of nervous anticipation in the past few days, after nicking Steve Jobs' famous \"and finally\" gambit to finally introduce a new product line in the shape of the Apple Watch.\n\nBut if longstanding rumours that Apple has been working on an iDiot Box since the Jobsian golden era are to believed, Cupertino has its heart set on developing a screen much bigger than the timepiece's sapphire glass face.\n\nTim was typically tight-lipped about his firm's plans to take on the television industry like his predecessor did with the music biz.\n\n\"I don't want to get into what we're doing in the future. We've taken stabs with Apple TV, and Apple TV now has over 20m users, so it has far exceeded the hobby label that we placed on it,\" Cook continued.\n\n\"We've added more and more content to it this year, so there's increasingly more things that you can do on there. but this is an area that we continue to look at.\"\n\nVideo of Tim Cook talking to Charlie Rose, where he makes the comments we report below.\n\nFollowing the launch of the Apple Watch, Cook has repeatedly invoked the memory of Steve Jobs. In the first part of the interview with Rose, he even confessed that the Apple godhead's office has been left untouched since his death, in the style of Dickens' Miss Havisham and her home. The rest of this unusually open interview will screen tonight in the US, so we might expect even more necromancy from the king of Cupertino.\n\nIf Apple really does have plans to release a TV, it will most likely receive a response which could only be surpassed if Steve Jobs rose again from the underworld to lead a crusade which will finish off his enemies (to wit: IBM, easily accessible buttons, any jumper that isn't a black turtleneck) for good.\n\nAt least one of those two game-changing events now looks more than likely. \u00ae",

He also revealed that you'll be able to store and playback music from the watch using bluetooth.\n\nCalling Beats co-founders Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine \"creative geniuses,\" Cook said the company's subscription service impressed him and justified the $3 billion price tag. \"All of a sudden it dawns on me that when I listen to theirs for awhile, I feel completely different,\" he said of Beats Music. \"And the reason is that they recognized that human curation was important in the subscription service -- that the sequencing of songs that you listen to affect how you feel.\"\n\nCook was unsurprisingly vague about Apple's next moves, but he did confirm the obvious: they're working on stuff that will keep tech blogs in business for years to come. \"There are products that we're working on that no one knows about,\" he said. \"That haven't been rumored about yet.\" One of the future products may be TV-related, as Cook called the current user experience \"stuck in the '70s,\" adding that it feels like \"you're rewinding the clock and you've entered a time capsule.\"\n\nCook also said Steve Jobs' office has been left untouched since his death in 2011. \"He's in my heart and he's deep in Apple's DNA,\" he told Rose. \"His spirit will always be the foundation of the company.

                    "body": "During his one-on-one meeting with Jobs, Cook learned about the company's desire to enter the consumer space. Jobs also described a wonder computer Apple was working on but hadn't yet released, the iMac. The iMac was the first hit product Jobs launched when he returned as Apple's CEO in 1997. It's been credited for helping turn around the entire company after Apple nearly went bankrupt in the 90s.\n\nCook also felt like he and Jobs would work well together, so he followed his gut and went to work for Apple.\n\n\"All of a sudden I thought, 'I'm doing it. I'm going for it,'\" Cook tells Rose. \"And you have this voice in your ear that says, 'Go west young man, go west.'\"\n\nhow Jobs convinced him to join Apple in a recent interview:\n\nCharlie Rose: I mentioned at the beginning interview, the fact, when you made a decision in 1998 about Apple. You had some reservations. But at the same time, during your interview with Steve, you said, something like this, I was prepared within five minutes to throw caution to the wind. What did he say that made you believe this company is the place for Tim Cook?\n\nTim Cook: It was an interesting meeting. I had gotten a call several times from the search people that he had employed. And I said no, I was at Compaq, I was happy and, or thought I was. And they were persistent. And so I finally thought, I'm going to go out and take the meeting. Steve created the whole industry that I'm in, I'd love to meet him. And so I'm honestly going into the meeting.\n\nCR: There's no downside of this.\n\nTC: Well I'm just thinking I'm going to meet him and all of a sudden he's talking about his strategy and his vision, and what he was doing was going 100 percent into consumer. When everybody else in the industry had decided you couldn't make any money on consumers so they were headed to services and storage and enterprise. And I thought, I'd always thought that following the herd was not a good thing, that it was a terrible thing to do right? You're either going to lose big, or lose, but those are the two options. He was doing something totally different.\n\nAnd he told me a little about the design, enough to get me really interested. And he was describing what later would be called the iMac. And the way that he talked, and the way the chemistry was in the room, it was just he and I. And I could tell, I can work with him.\n\nAnd I looked at the problems Apple had, and I thought you know, I can make a contribution here. And working with him, and this is a privilege of a lifetime. And so all of a sudden I thought, I 'm doing it. I'm going for it. And you have this voice in your ear that says go west young man, go west. I was young at the time. But you know, you come back and you try to do the things that people do with spreadsheets and stuff, and none of it makes sense. It didn't make sense. And yet, my gut said, go for it. And I listened to my gut. There was literally no one around me that was inviting doing it.",

                    "body": "Tim Cook interviewed by Charlie Rose on PBS. YouTube\n\nOn the heels of the launch of iPhone 6, Apple Pay and Apple Watch this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave a wide-ranging and pretty candid interview to PBS's Charlie Rose, which is airing in two parts Friday and Monday night. Cook weighed in on the U.S. government's data collection, co-founder Steve Jobs' legacy, and the \"terrible,\" \"awful\" of TV interfaces.\n\nCook has been talking about Apple's interest in TV publicly for several years now, and also conducting talks with the major owners of cable and broadcast networks, all the while building out a onetime \"hobby\": Apple TV. Here are some key excerpts and clips:\n\nOn Apple's biggest competitor: \"Google is the top and they enable many people in the hardware business like Samsung, and Samsung is the best of the hardware companies in the Android world.\"\n\nOn U.S. domestic spying: \"I don't think the government found the right balance; I think they erred too much on the collect-everything side. I think the president and the administration is committed to moving that pendulum back. It's probably not right to not do anything, so it's a careful line to walk. You want to make sure you're protecting the American people but there's no reason for them to collect information on you or 99.999 percent of other people.\"\n\nOn Apple's use of data: \"When we design a new service we try not to collect data. So we are not reading your email, we are not reading your imessages. If the government laid a subpoena on us to give them your imessages, we cannot provide it. It's encrypted and we don't have the key.\"\n\nOn Steve Jobs' legacy: \"His office is still as it was on the fourth floor. His name is still on the door. If you think about the things he stood for on a macro level, he stood for innovation, he stood for the simple not the complex. He knew Apple should only enter areas where we control the primary technology. All those things are still deep in our DNA.\"\n\nOn what Apple doesn't do: \"The hardest decisions we make are the things not to work on, frankly. There are lots of things we'd like to work on that we have interest in but we know we can't do everything great.\"\n\nOn TV: \"TV is one that we continue to have great interest in. I choose my words carefully there, but TV is one of those things that if we are really honest it's stuck back in the '70s. Think about how much your life has changed, and all the things around you that have changed, and yet TV, when you go into your living room, it almost feels like you're rewinding the clock and you're in a time capsule and you're going backwards. The interface is terrible, I mean it's awful.\"\n\nOn Beats: \"Jimmy [Iovine] and Dr. Dre are off-the-charts creative geniuses ... I think they've done a fabulous job with their brand, the headphone business. It's a fast growing business. But they needed a global footprint. we have a global footprint -- they have been primarily U.S. I felt we could get a subscription service, we could get incredible talent and we could put our heads together and do some things that are beyond what either of us are doing.\n\nShare this article Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google + More",

Per Re/code, Apple CEO Tim Cook told Charlie Rose on Friday that \"there are products we're working on that no one knows about, yes -- that haven't been rumored about yet.\"\n\nWhile Cook would obviously not go into any details about what these products are, it's safe to say that not everything that Apple is making in its laboratory will ever see the light of day. Typically we start hearing rumors about a product Apple's been working on when the company feels confident enough in it that it starts telling outside sources. This was definitely the case with the iPad and the Apple Watch, although there have been some rumored products such as the aforementioned iTV and the \"iRing\" (ugh, remember that?) that seem confined to the fevered dreams of analysts.\n\nThat said, anyone looking for signs that an iTV might be coming in the future can take solace from the fact that Cook also told Rose that \"TV is one we continue to have great interest in,\" largely because Cook thinks that television sets are still \"stuck back in the '70s.\"",

The comments fall in line with Apple's long held policy of resisting to market changes and consumer demands.\n\n\"We could have done a larger iPhone years ago,\" Cook said. Larger screened devices have been commonplace in the market for a long time before Apple's launch of the iPhone 6 four days back. \"It's never been about just making a larger phone ... it's been about making a better phone in every single way. And so we ship things when they're ready, and we think that both the display technology here, the battery technology, but all -- but everything else and the software.\"\n\nApple followed the same rule with the launch of the original iPod in 2001. The late Steve Jobs well known for his strict attention to detail and uncompromising nature reportedly had Cupertino examine all the mp3 devices available in the marketplace at the time. The iPod was then created in a manner that fulfilled everything that Jobs believed the devices were lacking in.\n\nCook also commented on the Apple Watch, Apple's first attempt into the smartwatch market. Even though the demand for smartwatches is not that strong at the moment, it has become a norm for smartphone manufacturers to introduce their devices. Samsung, LG, Motorola all have their devices available in the market.\n\nCook also said that the Apple Watch contains 400 - 500 components on a single chip. Many fitness experts have expressed disappointment at the Apple Watch's ability to cater to fitness needs and said that the device could do more. Commenting on Samsung and Google, Mr. Cook said that he considers Apple's main rival to be Google rather than Samsung.\n\nWhen asked why, he replied that it is Google that supplies Android to Samsung and other manufacturers. Mr. Cook also promised a variety of new products from the Cupertino based manufacturer saying that there is a diverse portfolio of blow away products that nobody knows about and aren't even rumored yet.",

It's too annoying to pay by credit card? @tim_cook needs to get out of his Apple bubble a bit more.'\n\nEarlier this year, reports claimed Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV had been delayed until next year.\n\nApple engineers working on the gadget were told not to expect it to launch until 2015, and the delay was blamed on cable companies refusing to carry out deals with the tech giant.\n\nApple TV's streaming box was initially unveiled as iTV in 2006, and was a product the late chief executive Steve Jobs was said to have been keen on.\n\nThe latest generation model launched in March 2012.\n\nIt supports 1080p content from iTunes and Netflix, and it has more recently added CNBC channel with live broadcasts, and FOX NOW - the on-demand app for the network that includes episodes of Glee, Family Guy and more.\n\nApple sold more than $1 billion of Apple TV set-top boxes during 2013 year and is 'investing heavily in the next generation of products', boss Tim Cook said at the company's annual meeting earlier this year.\n\nThe firm is believed to be working on a range of TV sets alongside an improved version of its current $99 TV box.",

You don't see it in a lot of places. They have some tablets. But they're not a product company. Apple is a product company. And so, in the long term, will they become a bigger product company? I don't know. You would have to ask Jeff what his plans are. But when I think of competitor, I would think of Google... much above anyone else.\"\n\nHis choice of words was a little brutal, but the comment speaks to Amazon's lack of traction with its new Fire Phone, and the extreme seasonality of the company's Kindle Fire tablets.\n\nOf course, Amazon's traditional strength has been in commerce, and Apple is encroaching further into that area with its Apple Pay system.\n\nThe full interview isn't yet online, and Charlie Rose's site appears to be down this morning, but ZDNet has extended written excerpts from Cook's remarks, and the Wall Street Journal also has a summary of his comments.

                    "body": "Last night, Charlie Rose aired the first half of his two-part interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook. It was a wide-ranging conversation covering Apple's current products and problems, the future of the company, and (of course) the loss of Steve Jobs. Here are the most important tidbits you might have missed.\n\nOn the iCloud hack that internet thieves used to steal private nude photos of female celebrities, Tim held the line he's used before: iCloud wasn't hacked, individual users were.\n\nIt wasn't hacked. There's a misunderstanding about this. If you think about what hacking iCloud would mean, it means somebody would get into the cloud and could fish around in people's accounts. That didn't happen. What happened was, let's take you as an example. Somebody could say 'I know Charlie's ID' somehow, maybe it's his email, and they may guess your password. Or, that's not as likely -- they might phish it. How do you phish it? I could pretend to be somebody else, and you could unknowingly give me your password. And that happens on the internet too many times today. That's the number one issue by far, and it's not just an Apple issue. This is an internet issue.\n\nYou just saw that this happened to I think millions of Gmail users. They were phished. My understanding is, it wasn't a breach there either of the infrastructure, it was a phishing expedition. There are lots of bad people that do this. And what we said was, we need to figure out how can we try to protect our customers on this. That's our top goal, and so we're working internally about how to bring more awareness to these schemes. Some of it is like a public service announcement. We have to do things where we notify the customer quickly if it does happen, that's reactive. We don't want it to happen at all, but if it does, you probably want to know instantly. There are things like that, and some other things I can't describe right now, where we think we can make a contribution beyond just making sure the cloud's not hacked.\n\nCharlie also asked about the company's newfound willingness to work with outside partners, rather than do everything in-house. On Apple partnering with IBM to offer more work-related products:\n\nAre we more open? Yes. We look at these products and the iPads that aren't here, and we think we can change the way people work. We've changed the consumer's life, we've changed the way students learn and teachers teach, but when you get to the working environment the change we've made to us isn't significant enough. And so we begin to ask ourselves, why haven't we done more? The real answer is, in the applications, there's not enough apps that have been written for very deep verticals like what the airline pilot does, what the bank teller does, down at the level of the job. So we begin to ask ourselves should we do this, or should we partner, or should we just forget it? And I didn't want to forget it, because this is a way to enrich people's lives in a big way, to change the way people work, I mean, most of our life is spent working. And certainly our apps are changing the way I work, but I'm not seeing it as much in other places.\n\nAnd so we begin looking out and thinking who can we partner with. And [IBM CEO Ginni Rometty] and I have been talking about some other things for awhile, I have great respect for her, great trust in her. We begin to talk about this area, this is an area where they've got things that we don't have. They've got deep vertical knowledge of many different industries. They have a huge sales force. So IBM brings significant enterprise knowledge to the table. We bring the products that enterprise want. So we have something they don't have. We also don't compete on anything. To me, this is the perfect marriage. There's no friction, there's just we have what they need, they have what we need, together we can provide something to customers that is blow-away. So IBM is in the process, with our help, of designing many different apps, for many different verticals, from banking to financial services to pharmaceutical to aerospace, and manufacturing, and they have the go to market that we don't have. This is an area where I think everybody's gonna win. We're gonna win, IBM's gonna win, and more importantly than us, the customer's gonna win.\n\nTim came to the interview fully equipped with new Apple products: An iPhone 6, a 6 Plus, and an Apple Watch on his wrist. He briefly showed the Watch to Charlie, and mentioned a feature that may have gone unmentioned in the initial announcement:\n\nIt requires an iPhone, because they've been designed to work together. However, if you go for a run, and you don't want to carry your iPhone, music is also on your watch. So with a Bluetooth headset, you can run and listen to your music without your iPhone.\n\nTim Cook is very measured in his public comments -- his conversation with Charlie Rose didn't give away much that we hadn't already known. Perhaps the most revealing part was when Charlie asked Tim about Steve Jobs. You can see Tim briefly let the PR guard down here. He's not talking about business any more. He's talking about an old friend.\n\nThe second half of Charlie's interview with Tim Cook will air on Monday. Set your DVR, or yourself down on the couch, according to your local listing.",

                    "body": "El CEO de Apple, Tim Cook, ha explicado la raz\u00f3n que ha motivado que Apple haya tardado varios a\u00f1os en introducir un iPhone de gran formato. Cook ha comentado que la compa\u00f1\u00eda ha esperado hasta poder ofrecer un producto que no solo sea m\u00e1s grande, sino que sea \"mejor en todos los sentidos\".\n\nDesde que Apple ha presentado los nuevos iPhone 6 y iPhone 6 Plus se est\u00e1 comentando el cambio de estrategia de la compa\u00f1\u00eda. La adopci\u00f3n de un tama\u00f1o de pantalla mayor y la apuesta por un dispositivo que se va hasta las 5,5 pulgadas suponen un cambio importante en la pol\u00edtica de Apple, que hasta ahora hab\u00eda preferido tel\u00e9fonos m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os. Compa\u00f1\u00edas como Samsung y especialistas del sector han acusado a Apple de cambiar su estrategia demasiado tarde, siguiendo la l\u00ednea de desarrollo de empresas de la competencia.\n\nEl CEO de Apple, Tim Cook, ha concedido una entrevista en la que ha tratado ese tema, explicando los motivos que han llevado a Apple a esperar para ofrecer un tel\u00e9fono como el iPhone 6. En concreto, Cook ha asegurado que podr\u00edan haber lanzado un equipo m\u00e1s grande \"hace a\u00f1os\" y no ha dudado en defender la pol\u00edtica de Apple. As\u00ed, el m\u00e1ximo responsable de la compa\u00f1\u00eda ha asegurado que su objetivo ha sido ofrecer un buen tel\u00e9fono, no solo un tel\u00e9fono grande.\n\n\"Nunca se ha tratado de simplemente ofrecer un tel\u00e9fono m\u00e1s grande. La cuesti\u00f3n ha sido ofrecer un tel\u00e9fono mejor en todos los sentidos. En este sentido lanzamos los productos cuando est\u00e1n listos\", ha explicado Tim Cook en declaraciones recogidas por The Wall Street Journal. De esta forma, Cook parece responder a los cr\u00edticos que apuntan que Apple ha reconocido su error y ha dado la raz\u00f3n a Samsung en su apuesta por dispositivos de gran formato.\n\nPrecisamente desde Samsung se ha desplegado una campa\u00f1a de promoci\u00f3n que dirige su atenci\u00f3n hacia ese aspecto. A trav\u00e9s de distintos v\u00eddeos, Samsung ha criticado que Apple ahora decida presentar un tel\u00e9fono como el iPhone 6 Plus despu\u00e9s de que se descartase el \u00e9xito de tel\u00e9fonos de gran formato.\n\nLa entrevista ofrecida por Tim Cook tambi\u00e9n ha servido para conocer la posici\u00f3n de Apple en otros campos y para confirmar algunos de sus planes de futuros. Por ejemplo, el CEO de Apple ha dado su visi\u00f3n sobre los problemas relacionados con el \"CelebGate\", que se sald\u00f3 con el robo de fotograf\u00edas de famosos a trav\u00e9s de iCloud.\n\nTim Cook ha vuelto a destacar que iCloud haya sufrido un problema de seguridad. Cook ha mantenido que los famosos afectados han sufrido ataques individuales que se han saldado con el robo de las fotograf\u00edas. Pese a lamentar lo sucedido, el CEO de Apple ha insistido en que iCloud era y es seguro.\n\nOtro aspecto sobre el que se ha pronunciado ha sido sobre Apple Mapas. Tim Cook ha reconocido que el estreno del servicio no fue un \u00e9xito por los errores registrados en la plataforma. Cook no ha dudado en reconocer que el lanzamiento se deber\u00eda haber hecho con mayores garant\u00edas para que el servicio no presentase algunos de los problemas que ten\u00eda.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, el CEO de Apple ha hablado sobre sus planes para desarrollar un nuevo Apple TV y sobre su competencia. Preguntado sobre si ve\u00eda a Amazon como un rival, Cook ha asegurado que en su opini\u00f3n su principal competidor es Google, empresa con la que compite en distintos campos.",

La elecci\u00f3n del lugar, tan emblem\u00e1tico para Apple, no es casual. En \u00e9l se presentaron los dos productos que marcaron las dos eras de Apple: el Macintosh y el iMac. Y la nueva Apple vuelve al mismo lugar para marcar el inicio de la nueva era. La era de Tim Cook.\u200b\n\nHasta los anuncios y los v\u00eddeos de presentaci\u00f3n de los productos ten\u00edan ese aire de referencia a \"2001, una odisea en el espacio\". Desde la presentaci\u00f3n vertical del iPhone 6 y 6 PLus, pasando por el propio anuncio de los tel\u00e9fonos (con las voces de Jimmy Fallon y Justin Timberlake) hasta la introducci\u00f3n del Apple Watch.\n\n\u200b\n\nHasta tal punto es una nueva era, que han decidido que el \"One More Thing\" no era una costumbre de Steve Jobs (y por lo tanto deber\u00eda morir con \u00e9l) sino que es un activo m\u00e1s de la Apple de Tim Cook y por lo tanto pueden utilizarlo cuando convenga. Es tal vez el pisot\u00f3n a las \u00faltimas ascuas que quedaban de la anterior (que no vieja) Apple.\n\nTodo manda el mensaje de \"empieza una nueva era\". Bienvenidos a Apple 3.0\n\n- Tim Cook el triunfador en su momento de gloria.\n\nA\u00fan m\u00e1s impactante que esos peque\u00f1os detalles era la satisfacci\u00f3n, relajamiento y alivio que transmit\u00eda Tim Cook por haber conseguido llegar hasta all\u00ed.

Ya no es el legado de Jobs, ahora es la finca de Cook.\n\nToda la presentaci\u00f3n estuvo llena de gestos al p\u00fablico que dec\u00edan, \"lo he conseguido\", y eso incluye los momentos extra\u00f1os, un propio de \"nuevo rico\", de referencia a los famosos, como cuando se dirige al p\u00fablico pregunt\u00e1ndole si reconoc\u00eda las voces en off del anuncio, y por supuesto el momento ligeramente embarazoso de \"BFF\" (Best Friends Forever) con Bono en el escenario.\n\nTim Cook no es el guardi\u00e1n de la herencia. La Apple 3.0 triunfar\u00e1 o fracasar\u00e1, pero ser\u00e1 aventur\u00e1ndose en nuevos territorios inexplorados e intentando triunfar. Pero sin duda, adem\u00e1s de asistir a la hist\u00f3rica presentaci\u00f3n del Apple Watch, tambi\u00e9n vimos uno de los d\u00edas m\u00e1s felices de la vida de Tim Cook. El d\u00eda en que se demostr\u00f3 a si mismo y al mundo que de verdad (y no por herencia) es el CEO de Apple.",

Con el lanzamiento del nuevo iPhone 6, Tim Cook acudi\u00f3 a una de las tiendas de la compa\u00f1\u00eda cerca de su casa en Silicon Valley y se uni\u00f3 a la nueva moda de realizar selfies. Los usuarios m\u00e1s veteranos estaban asombrados de encontrar al propio Tim Cook en la tienda.\n\nEl dirigente de Apple iba vestido con unos jeans y camiseta negra. Tim Cook decidi\u00f3 pasearse entre las inmensas colas de gente que esperaban entrar en la tienda para comprar el nuevo dispositivo de la empresa de la manzana.\n\nLas personas estaban expectantes ya que se iba a poner a la venta el nuevo producto de Apple que anunciaba numerosas mejoras.\n\nUno de los muchachos que hac\u00edan cola se acerc\u00f3 a Tim Cook y le pidi\u00f3 hacerse una selfie con \u00e9, a lo que el jefe de Apple accedi\u00f3 tan s\u00f3lo con una condici\u00f3n.\n\nY es que Cook estaba encantado de ver a tanta gente que realizaba cola por sus\n\nproductos. Ante las peticiones de selfies dijo: \"\u00a1Claro, pero siempre que sea con un iPhone!\".\n\nEstando en el interior de la tienda, Tim Cook tambi\u00e9n particip\u00f3 en la cuenta regresiva que fue seguida de numerosos aplausos por parte de los asistentes.\n\nJusto en ese momento se abrieron las puertas y empezaron a venderse los nuevos dispositivos iPhone6. En las colas de Jap\u00f3n abundaban los ciudadanos chinos ya que todav\u00eda no ha llegado el dispositivo a China.\n\nHay que recordar en este punto que el nuevo iPhone, no obstante, es un producto importante por una sencilla raz\u00f3n: s\u00f3lo Apple pude producir tanto el '''hardware'' como el ''software''.",

En concreto, las palabras exactas de Tim dec\u00edan lo siguiente: \"Hay productos en los que hemos estado trabajando que nadie sabe de ellos a\u00fan, s\u00ed. No se han filtrado rumores a\u00fan.

Porque tocamos muchas cosas internamente. Es posible que decidamos empezar algo nuevo, parar un poco el avance del producto y abordar la idea de forma diferente\".\n\nUna de las declaraciones que m\u00e1s ha sorprendido de Cook han sido cuando ha reconocido que cometieron un error con el lanzamiento de Apple Maps. Esta aplicaci\u00f3n tuvo numerosos errores y el CEO se excusaba diciendo que \"si nunca cometes un error es que probablemente no est\u00e1s haciendo suficiente\".\n\nPor \u00faltimo, tambi\u00e9n reconoci\u00f3 que su competencia m\u00e1s directa en Apple ahora mismo es la compa\u00f1\u00eda Google.
