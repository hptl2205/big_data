Though ISIS claims to adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam, they have nonetheless targeted multiple Sunni shrines, blowing up or bulldozing any place they deem \"unIslamic.\"\n\nAccording to The Guardian, people living nearby the mosque told AP that ISIS members had declared that the holy site \"had become a place for apostasy, not prayer.\" The Imam Aoun Bin al-Hassan mosque was also destroyed on Thursday.\n\nThe tomb of Daniel, a man revered by Muslims as a prophet though unlike Jonah, he is not mentioned in the Quran, has also been reportedly destroyed. Al-Arabiya reports that Zuhair al-Chalabi, a local Mosul official, told Al-Samaria News that \"ISIS implanted explosives around Prophet Daniel's tomb in Mosul and blasted it, leading to its destruction.\"\n\nAFP reports that an anonymous official said, \"Islamic State completely destroyed the shrine of Nabi Yunus after telling local families to stay away and closing the roads to a distance of 500 metres from the shrine.\"\n\nThe tomb of Jonah was a popular place of pilgrimage for people who would come from around the world to see it, before the arrival of ISIS in Mosul. At the end of the video showing the destruction of Jonah's tomb, a man can be heard saying,\"No, no, no. Prophet Jonas is gone. God, these scoundrels,\" according to NPR.\n\nThis latest act by ISIS shows their disregard for holy places, even Muslim ones from the Sunni sect they claim to hail from. Sam Hardy, a professor at the American University of Rome, told The Washington Post that he believes this shows that ISIS is willing to destroy, \"basically pretty much anything in the Bible.\" He added, \"It indicates they are going for total eradication not just of their enemies but even of the possibility of people living together under their rule.\"\n\nLeila Fadel of NPR believes that ISIS's destruction of shrines may be a big mistake when it comes to rallying other Muslim militant groups to its cause, especially considering that it previously declared an \"Islamic caliphate.\" She said, \"it may cause a deep rift in the uneasy alliances the Sunni extremist group has made with other Sunni fighting groups marginalized.\"",

The militants shut down all doors of the mosque, preventing religious observers from entering for their daily prayer, before blowing up the holy site.\n\n\"ISIS militants have destroyed the shrine of Prophet Younis (Jonah) east of Mosul city after they seized control over the mosque completely,\" an anonymous security source told the Iraq-based al-Sumaria News.\n\nThe ISIS members reportedly blocked the entrances to the mosque before securing the perimeter and placing explosives throughout the holy place of worship. It took ISIS nearly an hour to fill the area with explosive devices. They incinerated the holy site in front of many observers.\n\nThe prophet Jonah is best known in the Old Testament of the Bible -- as well as the Quran -- as the man swallowed by a large fish. Jonah spent three days and three nights residing inside the fish, praying to God. He is saved by God, then proceeds to save the people of Nineveh. Jonah is revered in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.\n\nThe tomb of the prophet Jonah in Mosul was the primary shrine to the biblical figure in the world, and served as his major worship site. It was built on an archeological site dating back to the 8 century BC, and is believed to be the burial place of Jonah, although this fact cannot be fully confirmed. The shrine was last renovated by Sadam Hussein during the 1990s. Since then, the site has remained a popular site for religious pilgrims of all three faiths.\n\nISIS presents the greatest crisis seen yet by the Iraqi people since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. The militants have seized huge chunks of territory within the country, gaining control of major cities in both the West and the North, as well as along the Iraqi-Syrian border.\n\nThe last time a Muslim terrorist organization destroyed a religious site was when the Taliban blew up sandstone statues of the Buddha in Kabul in 2001. T incident prompted an international outcry, and spurred religious leaders -- as well as government officials -- to work diligently to preserve the country's cultural heritage.",

Here on The Inquisitr, we reported numerous times on their movements, including their persecutions against Christians which includes the burning of an 1,800-year-old church and an ultimatum to Iraqi Christians to convert to Islam or face death. Let's not forget our report on ISIS ordering the genital mutilation of Muslim women too. And for those who are still not informed on the ISIS threat, there is a video that explains the situation in less than five minutes.\n\nNow ISIS terrorists have shown their disrespect for all three Abrahamic monotheistic religions by destroying the historical tomb of a prophet all three have in common: Jonah.\n\nAccording to a report by MSN, the terrorists -- known as the new jihadist rulers of Iraq's northern city of Mosul -- completely leveled the Nabi Yunus shrine on Thursday. The prophet Yunis is the Koran's name of the Biblical prophet Jonah. Still, whether it be Jonah or Yunis, his tomb was completely destroyed as mentioned in a statement by an official at the Sunni endowment, which manages Sunni religious affairs in Iraq:\n\n\"Islamic State completely destroyed the shrine of Nabi Yunis (Jonah) after telling local families to stay away and closing the roads to a distance of 500 meters from the shrine.\"\n\nThe endowment official, who remained anonymous, said it took the terrorists an hour to rig the shrine with explosives. A witness, who chose not to give their name, gave their view of what happened at the shrine too:\n\n\"They first stopped people from praying in it, they fixed explosive charges around and inside it and then blew it up in front of a large gathering of people.\"\n\nIn another report by CNN, Jonah's tomb may not actually have been inside the Nabi Yunus shrine. Biblical scholars are divided on whether the tomb in Mosul actually belonged to Jonah. Jewish tradition states he returned to his hometown of Gath-Hepher after his mission to Nineveh. Also, some modern scholars say that Jonah's story is more myth than history, especially the part about being inside the belly of a whale for three days and three nights. Scholars, Joel S. Baden and Candida Moss, wrote a blog entry about how Jonah is actually more important in Christianity compared to Islam and Judaism. The entry states the following:\n\n\"In Christian tradition, the story of Jonah is an important one. Jonah's descent into the depth of the belly of the great fish and subsequent triumphant prophetic mission to Nineveh is seen as a reference to and prototype of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nMaybe that is why the ISIS terrorists destroyed the shrine in the first place because they refer to the destruction of Jonah's tomb as an attack on Christians living in Iraq today.\n\n[Images via Bing]",

                    "body": "BAGHDAD -- When the Sunni extremists ruling Mosul destroyed the shrine of a prophet whose story features in the traditions of Islam, Christianity and Judaism -- the most important of nearly two dozen marked for destruction by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in the first seven weeks of its reign -- small groups of residents gathered to mourn.\n\n\"We were crying when they detonated it,\" said Abdulmalik Mustafa, a 32-year-old unemployed man who lives near the site, believed to be the tomb of the biblical prophet Jonah, which was razed last week. \"We couldn't believe that the history of Mosul has disappeared. I wanted to die.\"\n\nThen rumors swirled that the next target of the ISIS militants would be toppling the city's ancient leaning minaret, which is older than the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy and pictured on Iraq's 10,000-dinar bank note. Residents gathered at the minaret and, according to witnesses, angrily confronted the group's fighters.\n\nFor now, the tower is still standing.\n\nThe angry public reaction to the attacks on Mosul's cultural history -- including the eviction of Christians by militants, which outraged many Muslim residents who celebrate Mosul's reputation for tolerance -- appears to be the first spark of rebellion against harsh Islamic rule. Although population figures in Iraq are notoriously unreliable, Mosul is considered the country's second-largest city, with a population of about 1.5 million.\n\nWhen militants swept into the city on June 10 and Iraqi soldiers shed their uniforms and fled, many residents seemed to cheer their arrival. Much of Mosul's Sunni Arab population had become increasingly resentful of abuses suffered at the hands of Iraq's Shiite-dominated central government. For a time, people welcomed the new authority.\n\nIt is too early to declare that a wide-scale rebellion is underway, or that ISIS, whose brand of ascetic Islamic law deems shrines heretical, is losing its grip of control on the city. But it suggests that the militants are wearing out their welcome to some degree.\n\nInformal armed gangs of residents have already clashed with ISIS militants over the destruction of the tombs and shrines, residents say. Some militants have been killed in the clashes, they say, which have also resulted in the arrests of residents and could result in their executions.\n\n\"There are unorganized groups fighting ISIS now,\" said Khalis Jumah, 32, a Mosul resident interviewed by phone. \"If we had the power and the supplies, we could have kicked ISIS out of Mosul by now.\"\n\nMr. Jumah said the rising anger inside Mosul was directly related to the destruction of historical sites. \"This is a huge disaster for Mosul and Iraq,\" he said. \"It's a crime against the city and its history. We have been crying since the first day they started destroying our religious and historical landmarks.\"\n\nThe rising public anger also resonates with a strategy being pushed by American officials and some moderate Sunnis here: working to win over some of the Sunni insurgent groups that have allied with ISIS.\n\nThose groups, which include former Baathists who were once close to Saddam Hussein's government and have already, in some places, fought with ISIS, are opposed to what they regard as the authoritarian rule of rule of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's government. But they are also seen as unsympathetic to stated goal of ISIS to establish an Islamic caliphate under hard-line theocratic rule.\n\nThe strategy of trying to peel off the non-ISIS Sunni groups is a familiar one in Iraq, with a decidedly mixed legacy. It was born with the so-called Sunni Awakening program the Americans established in 2007, when Sunni tribal groups were paid to switch sides and fight against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the forerunner of ISIS.\n\nThe Awakening found success after Al Qaeda had alienated Sunni communities with its brutal rule. But its gains were unsustainable, particularly because Mr. Maliki's Shiite-dominated government was unwilling to widely integrate Sunni militias into the country's security forces.\n\nStill, there is no doubt that ISIS has begun alienating some in Mosul.\n\nAlmost immediately after capturing the city, militants began imposing Islamic law. They banned smoking, forced women to wear a full-face veils and carried out some summary executions of government employees they deemed disloyal to their authority.\n\nBut it has been the destruction of more than a dozen mosques, shrines, tombs and statues that has seemed to galvanize public anger within Mosul, an area that was once the capital of the Assyrian Empire and a region believed to have first been settled in 6000 B.C. Over the centuries, various conquerors -- Persians, Arabs, Turks and others -- have come and gone, each leaving their imprint.\n\nWith so many shrines being destroyed, this week relatives of Saddam Hussein removed the dead dictator's body from its burial place in Awija, a village near Tikrit, and moved it to an undisclosed location, one of Mr. Hussein's cousins said in a brief interview. Relatives worried that the grave, which had become something of a shrine for Mr. Hussein's sympathizers, would become a target of government airstrikes or for the Shiite militias active in the area.\n\nIt is not just religious monuments like the prophet Jonah's tomb that have been destroyed, but also statues of Abu Tammam, a famous Arab poet, and Mullah Othman, a beloved 19th century musician and poet.\n\nMilitants even removed a statue of a figure representing an old Mosul profession: a man selling a drink of licorice, for which the city is famous. Even today, men walk the streets with a pouch of the drink slung over their shoulders and clang copper goblets to signal their presence.\n\n\"We realize the licorice man from the music he plays,\" said Talal Safawi, a sculptor who carved the statue in 1973 and has remained in Mosul.\n\n\"This statue is part of my body as I am part of him,\" he said. \"He is my friend. He is everything to me. I can't forget the face of my statue.\"\n\nTraveling through Mosul more than a century ago, when the city was loosely governed by the Ottoman Empire, Gertrude Bell, a British traveler and writer who later would help establish modern Iraq after World War I, toured the ancient sites and reflected on the city's traumatic history.\n\n\"Upon the unhappy province of Mosul hatred and the lust of slaughter weigh like inherited evils, transmitted (who can say?) through all the varying generations of conquerors since first the savage might of the Assyrian Empire set its stamp upon the land,\" she wrote in 1909.\n\nShe was happy to report, though, that despite what she called Mosul's \"turbulent record,\" the city had \"lost nothing of its quality during the past few years.\"\n\nThe same cannot be said now, with ISIS determined to erase a heritage that many previous conquerors left intact.\n\nBashar al-Kiki, the chairman of the Nineveh Provincial Council, who tracks events in Mosul from the Kurdish region in the north, said that armed civilians had recently attacked against ISIS and four militants were killed.\n\n\"The people of Mosul are intensely angry at ISIS,\" he said. \"They can't bear them anymore. This volcano of anger will explode soon.\"",

His grandson Halako (or Hulago Khan) led the Mangol charge on Baghdad (the then capital of Abbasid Caliphate) and ended the golden period of Islam that many Muslims crave to bring back today. But ISIS has surely crashed the party as they are operating in the same area where the last battle to protect Islamic civilization was fought. And they are doing it with the same ferocity which was the hallmark of barbaric Mangols.\n\nThrough summary executions and mass killings the ISIS has sown fear in the hearts of its opponents as Iraqi army is cringing and flinching under ISIS pressure while Syrian army, rebels and Kurds are also licking the wounds that ISIS has inflicted so easily. It seems there is no end to this blitz. These marauding daredevils have surely listed themselves in the pages of history.\n\nBut as ISIS becomes the nemesis of the region, a source of instability and destruction, the question remains how long these marauding daredevils may hold on to their gains?\n\nStability and survival of a state is affected by many factors. A strong military force, international recognition and relations, economic stability and infrastructure, natural resources, internal peace and representation of various ethnic and religious factions in the government are the key attributes of a well-functioning state.\n\nThe ISIS, with its brutal techniques has proved that it is not a state but an empire which is hell bent on grabbing more land and resources than to start a nation building process. It is highly unlikely that the people under the ISIS' rule, belonging to different social and ethnic backgrounds will blend into one nation in the blink of any eye. Though the ISIS is appealing to their religious sentiments and lay emphasis on \"Muslim Brotherhood\" but its own actions are contradictory to its words. As it has massacred hundreds of thousands of Muslims just for resisting or opposing it and it continues to do so.\n\nAnother thing is that the ISIS has not come to power by the people's will but rather imposed itself on them exploiting the civil war and then suppressing them with brutal force. So in response the people are not likely to support it in the long run.\n\nThird thing about an empire is that it is always led by a 'strongman'. The ISIS' current head honcho is no doubt a charismatic figure and a 'strongman' but an empire cannot be run just by one man alone and sooner or later the question of his succession might arise. And as is the problem with every empire that with the fall of strongman the empire is always ripped apart with successor states fighting for the legacy of that empire and this is likely to happen with ISIS too.\n\nThe current head honcho of the ISIS is acting more like a demagogue who is more interested in rabble-rousing from his soapbox than managing a state. On his orders the Iraqi cities were subverted and looted with 450 million dollars of dough plundered from just banks in the Iraqi city of Mosul. No doubt, it can be dubbed as the largest heist of the history of mankind. This is the way the ISIS is earning its money to run a state and carry on a costly war with all its neighbours (the only exception is Iraqi Kurds). The other 'source' of income for the ISIS is oil smuggling. How in the name of heavens a state can survive on its own when it is totally dependent on 'booty' and crimes? So the so-called Islamic state is likely to expand its military campaigns in order to get money while its earlier occupied regions are divested of all their wealth just because the state is unable to setup indusralisation and to create job opportunities for 'its people'.\n\nAs an empire is always coveting for more land the ISIS will keep on pressing with its Jihadi agenda of invading other lands and bringing them under 'Islamic rule'. It means that on its fringes a war will always continue and more and more people will keep on dying and making those who still living under the 'Islamic State' more abject about their future. Destruction of the prophets' shrines (like Jonah and Sheth) and orders to conduct the female genital mutilation (FGN) is also likely to arouse suspicions among the teeming population that the life under the ISIS will not be more promising.\n\nOn the other hands the brutal tactics, inhuman punishments and utter ruthlessness towards both its friends and foes alike will not earn the ISIS any friends both at 'home' or 'abroad'. Another salient feature of the ISIS is clinching deals with local tribesmen especially in Iraq who are supporting the ISIS to get rid of the recalcitrance Shia government in Baghdad. But as the ISIS' unfolds its agenda of enslaving the people of the region, this sway is likely to diminish.\n\nAnother problem with the ISIS is that it has no roots in local population like its Shia rival Hezbullah or its Sunni counterpart Al-Nusra Front operating mainly in Syria. So its fighting 'core' is comprised of foreigners who are imposed on the local population under the ISIS rule and who are more interested in vandalizing than and constructive approach. This phenomenon has also pitted the local population and rival groups against the ISIS so many times. Even in Syria the ISIS has been expelled from the rebel held areas for the same reason.\n\nThe local fighters in the ISIS are just gunslingers who switch their loyalties for money. These turncoats act more like 'gold diggers' than like a fighter battling for an ideological cause. So once the groundswell leads people to take arms against the ISIS in the most unfortunate of times then the handful of foreign fighters are likely to face the same fate they inflicted upon their rivals because the people never forgive be it the French revolution or the Russian revolution.\n\nThe ISIS is also beset by the enemies, though they are bumbling now because of the ISIS' sudden success but once they come to their senses and their regional allies rally their supports behind them (like Iran, Saudi Arabia who are afraid on and ISIS invasion too) it will be matter of just few years if not months that the ISIS threat will be eliminated once and for all.\n\nBut for now the time is with the ISIS. Iraqi army's total obsequiousness and disarray among its foes has made it possible for the ISIS to linger on for more time than it deserves. This 'Fitna-e-Khawarij' (Kharijites) part two is taking a huge toll on the Muslims around the world. It has deepened the western suspicions about the Muslim ideology and it has also devastated two Muslim countries.\n\nThe ISIS is not oblivious to its fate and it is already trying its best to avoid it. It is already repairing road networks in its 'territory', electricity is being restored in many areas, local businessmen are being dealt 'fairly' with low 'taxes'. It is also eyeing the fact that its rivals can't muster all their courage and resources against it since they are busy fighting each other too and the United States is also balking at launching airstrikes and the Arab countries are confused. On the other hands the ISIS is still enjoying an upper hand in terms of territory and resources. It is also controlling key riparian lands alongside both Tigris and Euphrates rivers which flow in Syria and Iraq. Many oil fields are also under their control and so far they have lot of plundered money and oil to smuggle. So in the end it will be safe to predict that the ISIS is likely to loiter about for few years and then either it is a powerful outside force, a breakaway group, rival groups fighting back or Syrian and Iraqi forces turning the tide, a rebellion within or people's uprising, the barbaric bunch of rustlers will be history.\n\nAs in The Tale of Two Cities the hangman (death) and the woodman (fate) work in a subtle manner with devastating results for the tyrant. The continuous loss of innocent lives and utter savagery is surely coming home to roost.",

En base a las informaciones publicadas por el portal de noticias Iraqi News, los milicianos ordenaron a las personas que se encontraban en su interior abandonar el edificio antes de demolerlo, argumentando que \"la mezquita se ha convertido en un lugar de apostas\u00eda\". La explosi\u00f3n ha provocado da\u00f1os en varias viviendas ubicadas en los alrededores de la mezquita. El suceso ha tenido lugar un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que el Estado Isl\u00e1mico destruyera la mezquita del Imam Yahya Abul Qasim, que ten\u00eda 1.400 a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad.\n\nEl grupo extremista ha destruido en las \u00faltimas semanas m\u00faltiples lugares de culto de las comunidades chi\u00ed, cristiana, suf\u00ed y yazid\u00ed, as\u00ed como de cualquier otro grupo opuesto a su interpretaci\u00f3n radical del Islam. Esta misma semana, el Estado Isl\u00e1mico ha dado un ultim\u00e1tum a los residentes kurdos de Mosul para que abandonen la ciudad o se expongan a ser ejecutados, apenas d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de emitir una amenaza similar contra la comunidad cristiana de la localidad.\n\nEn 2003, la comunidad cristiana de Mosul ten\u00eda unos 35.000 fieles. En los once a\u00f1os siguientes al comienzo de la guerra, el n\u00famero cay\u00f3 tr\u00e1gicamente a alrededor de 3.000 y ahora quedan apenas dos decenas. El l\u00edder de la Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica Caldea, la principal iglesia del pa\u00eds, Louis Raphael Sako, valor\u00f3 que los milicianos del Estado Isl\u00e1mico son peores que el l\u00edder mongol Genghis Khan y su nieto Hulagu, que redujeron a cenizas Bagdad. \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo es posible que en el siglo XXI se expulse de sus casas a la gente por ser cristianos, chi\u00edes, sun\u00edes o yazidis?\", se pregunt\u00f3.\n\n\"Las familias cristianas han sido expulsadas de sus casas, sus bienes han sido robados, y sus viviendas han sido expropiadas en nombre del Estado Isl\u00e1mico\", explic\u00f3. \"Esto no pas\u00f3 nunca en la historia cristiana o isl\u00e1mica.
