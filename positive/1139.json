Pro Football Talk reports that Peterson will plead no contest to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault, and that the plea will not include any references to family violence or violence against a minor. According to that report, Peterson will pay a $2,000 fine, be placed on probation, and perform 80 hours of community service.\n\nOnce that plea is official, the NFL will have to decide whether to reinstate Peterson or hand down additional punishment, like a fine or further suspension. Under the arrangement that's kept Peterson off the field for the Vikings' last eight games, Peterson was placed on the commissioner's exempt list, and continued to receive his salary. Only commissioner Roger Goodell can reinstate Peterson from that list. Without any further suspension, Peterson would be eligible to return for Minnesota's next game, on November 16 against Chicago. Via ESPN, neither the NFL nor the Vikings have decided whether they'll suspend Peterson beyond the games he's already missed.",

Instead, he'll get probation, a fine as well as community service.\"\n\nTalks of a plea deal started leaking over the weekend, even though Peterson wasn't due back in court until Tuesday.\n\nPeterson originally was indicted on felony charge of injury to a child, charges that carried a sentence of up to two years in prison if convicted.\n\nNBC: \"The star running back has pleaded not guilty to charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child after he says he disciplined his son with a tree branch, or a switch, at his Texas home earlier this year.\"\n\nStill, its not clear when or if Peterson will see an NFL field again. He's been placed on the commissioner's/exempt list since Week 1, and the NFL hasn't released any indication or update to his status. The only time Commissioner Roger Goodell has spoken publicly about Peterson was during his much-analyzed press conference in September.\n\nGOODELL VIA WCCO: \"While I'm disappointed in what Adrian Peterson was involved with, we want to see the facts. But I think what we've seen, it's tragic and hard to look at.\"\n\nWhile on leave from the Vikings team, Peterson did still get paid his full $5.3 million salary.

Terms of the reported deal, which must be accepted by the judge in the case, mandate that Peterson pay a $2,000 fine, be placed on probation and be ordered to perform 80 hours of community service, with adjudication officially deferred for two years.\n\nPeterson would not have to serve jail time.\n\nIt was reported Sunday that Peterson and his representatives were having discussions about a potential plea agreement and that one could be completed as soon as Tuesday.\n\nPeterson was indicted by a grand jury in Texas in September on felony charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child after authorities said he hit his 4-year-old son with a switch. He faced up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted of the charges. A tentative trial date of Dec. 1 had been set, but the plea deal would end the legal process before any trial.\n\nIn the period following Peterson's indictment, a newspaper report referenced alleged improprieties with his charity and other claims of illicit behavior, and prosecutors attempted to have Peterson arrested again after he admitted to smoking marijuana. Late last month, prosecutors attempted to have Judge Kelly Case recused from the case after alleging he was biased against them, though the request was denied.\n\nWhile expressing remorse for his actions, Peterson maintained that he was merely disciplining his child and committed no crime. After his indictment, the Vikings deactivated Peterson for their Week 2 game against the New England Patriots before reinstating him the following week.\n\nPressure from the public, media and team and league sponsors, including Nike and Anheuser-Busch, led to Peterson being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list until his legal case was resolved, effectively placing him on paid leave.\n\nOnly NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has the authority to remove Peterson from the list. It's unknown if Peterson will face further discipline from the Vikings or the NFL should he reach the reported plea deal. It was reported last month that Peterson could be suspended by the league even if found not guilty of the charges against him.\n\nNews of Peterson's alleged child abuse came in the midst of controversy surrounding the NFL and the issue of domestic violence, initiated by the Ray Rice case. Earlier in the week in which Peterson was indicted, video showing Rice striking his then-fianc\u00e9e was released, leading to Rice's release from the Baltimore Ravens and his indefinite suspension from the NFL.\n\nThe incident led to renewed attention on the domestic violence case of Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was also then placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list, and on the NFL's domestic violence policy in general.\n\n- Ben Estes",

It was reported Sunday that Peterson and his representatives were having discussions about a potential plea agreement and that one could be completed as soon as Tuesday.\n\nPeterson was indicted by a grand jury in Texas in September on felony charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child after authorities said he hit his 4-year-old son with a switch. He faced up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if convicted of the charges. A tentative trial date of Dec. 1 had been set, but the plea deal ends the legal process before any trial.\n\nIn the period following Peterson's indictment, a newspaper report referenced alleged improprieties with his charity and other claims of illicit behavior, and prosecutors attempted to have Peterson arrested again after he admitted to smoking marijuana. Late last month, prosecutors attempted to have Judge Kelly Case recused from the case after alleging he was biased against them, though the request was denied.\n\nWhile expressing remorse for his actions, Peterson maintained that he was merely disciplining his child and committed no crime. After his indictment, the Vikings deactivated Peterson for their Week 2 game against the New England Patriots before reinstating him the following week.\n\nPressure from the public, media and team and league sponsors, including Nike and Anheuser-Busch, led to Peterson being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list until his legal case was resolved, effectively placing him on paid leave.\n\nOnly NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has the authority to remove Peterson from the list. It's unknown if Peterson will face further discipline from the Vikings or the NFL now that his case has been resolved. It was reported last month that Peterson could be suspended by the league even if found not guilty of the charges against him.\n\nNews of Peterson's alleged child abuse came in the midst of controversy surrounding the NFL and the issue of domestic violence, initiated by the Ray Rice case. Earlier in the week in which Peterson was indicted, video showing Rice striking his then-fianc\u00e9e was released, leading to Rice's release from the Baltimore Ravens and his indefinite suspension from the NFL.\n\nThe incident led to renewed attention on the domestic violence case of Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was also then placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list, and on the NFL's domestic violence policy in general.\n\nThis article originally appeared on SI.com",

                    "body": "Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has reportedly reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in Texas that will bring an end to his child-abuse case, Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk writes. The question now becomes how long it will be until he's allowed to return to an NFL playing field.\n\nPeterson will plea no contest to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault. If the plea is accepted, Peterson will be placed on probation, pay a $2,000 fine and be forced to perform 80 hours of community service. Peterson was indicted on a felony charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child last September.\n\nThere's been no word yet on how Peterson's agreement may affect his playing status for the 2014 season. His first obstacle would be getting cleared by the Vikings -- a not so simple decision after the franchise was heavily criticized for bungling his initial suspension. If the team does clear him, Peterson would then need to be removed from the commissioner's exempt list by Roger Goodell.\n\nIan Rapoport of NFL Network reported Monday that a plea deal would not mean an immediate reinstatement from the league. ESPN's Adam Schefter said there's not a lot of optimism that the NFL would clear Peterson this season but that it's \"certainly not out of the question.\"\n\nPeterson has not played since Week 1 but has continued to receive pay. His $86.28 million contract runs through 2017.",

Peterson, who had been facing felony charges of causing injury to a child, will instead face one misdemeanor assault charge, to which he will plead \"no contest.\"\n\nA plea of \"no contest,\" or nolo contendere, means that Peterson does not admit guilt in the matter, but also does not dispute the facts brought forth in the indictment against him. When the plea is entered in court, the judge will immediately sentence Peterson, who will avoid jail time for the incident and could face, at most, some form of probation, community service, and a fine.\n\nAs we said on Sunday when news of this potential plea deal first came out, the burden will now shift to the National Football League as to what to do with Peterson. He has already been suspended for eight games, albeit with pay, after being placed on the Commissioner's Exempt list during Week 2 of the NFL season. Only Roger Goodell can remove Peterson from the list, which one would assume would happen shortly after today's court session takes place.\n\nFrom there, nobody knows what Goodell and the NFL might do. Would they suspend him further? You could make the case that Peterson has already been off the field for eight games, and a suspension under the league's new policy on domestic violence calls for six. You could also make the case that the NFL might not see a \"with pay\" suspension as any sort of punishment and keep him off the field longer, as well as fine him.\n\nPeterson is set to appear in court at 1:30 PM Central time. At that time, the plea will be entered and the sentence handed down. Beyond that. . .well, I guess that's what the bye week is for.\n\nWe'll have any news on this story for you as it becomes available.",

The union will likely argue that the running back should be reinstated and perhaps forced to pay a substantial fine -- surrendering part of the income he's been receiving.\n\nPeterson has been on the commissioner's exempt list, and only commissioner Roger Goodell can reinstate him, so he could be required to meet with Goodell.\n\nBoth players -- Peterson and Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy -- agreed as part of this deal that they would be ineligible to play until their cases are adjudicated, but that they would receive full compensation until that time.\n\nOnce Goodell reinstates Peterson, presuming the commissioner eventually does so, the Vikings would either have to allow the running back to return to the team or be required to release him.\n\nThe Vikings' position on all of this remains a mystery. There has been a shroud of silence since Peterson was put on the exempt list, so there is uncertainty as to whether the Vikings are willing to reinsert Peterson into their lineup.\n\nVikings coach Mike Zimmer was asked about Peterson on Monday as the team began its bye week, and he made it clear he judges Peterson based on his own personal interactions and considers him to be \"top-notch, first-class.\"",

The union will likely argue that the running back should be reinstated and perhaps forced to pay a substantial fine -- surrendering part of the income he's been receiving.\n\nPeterson has been on the commissioner's exempt list, and only commissioner Roger Goodell can reinstate him, so he could be required to meet with Goodell.\n\nCarolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who is facing a trial for a domestic violence charge, also was placed on the exempt list in September.\n\nBoth players agreed as part of a deal that they would be ineligible to play until their cases are adjudicated, but that they would receive full compensation until that time.\n\nOnce Goodell reinstates Peterson, presuming the commissioner eventually does so, the Vikings would either have to allow the running back to return to the team or be required to release him.\n\nThe Vikings' position on all of this remains a mystery. They have been silent since Peterson was put on the exempt list, so there is uncertainty as to whether the Vikings are willing to reinsert Peterson into their lineup.\n\nVikings coach Mike Zimmer was asked about Peterson on Monday as the team began its bye week, and he made it clear he judges Peterson based on his own personal interactions and considers him to be \"top-notch, first-class.\"",

                    "body": "Adrian Peterson has signed a plea of no contest to misdemeanor charges of reckless assault, paving the way for his return to the NFL. The plea was accepted by Montgomery County judge Kelly Case. Peterson was indicted in September on a felony charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child. The indictment stemmed from an incident this past spring when he allegedly beat his four-year-old son with a switch.\n\nPro Football Talk reported the details of Peterson's plea bargain Tuesday. By accepting the deal, Peterson will have to go on probation, pay a $4,000 fine and perform 80 hours of community service. The plea reportedly includes no reference to family violence or violence against a minor. The deal also defers a ruling on Peterson's innocence for two years. Peterson forfeits the right to appeal.\n\nPer the conditions of his probation, Peterson will be subjected to random urine tests for two years. He will have no travel restrictions, but will have to meet monthly with a probation officer.\n\nThe prosecutor in the case said that the mother of Peterson's son would like Peterson to maintain a relationship with the child.\n\nPeterson was placed on the exempt/commissioner's permission list in September under the pretense that his status with the NFL and Minnesota Vikings would be revisited once his case had been resolved. The list allowed the Vikings to sit Peterson indefinitely with pay, but only after making a special request to commissioner Roger Goodell. Peterson can only be removed at Goodell's discretion.\n\nIt's unclear how Goodell will interpret Peterson's plea deal. The running back could be activated from his long leave only to sit under a suspension without pay. He could also theoretically suit up to play Nov. 16 when the Vikings visit the Chicago Bears after their Week 10 bye. Complicating matters is Peterson's reported admission to a court staffer that he \"smoked a little weed,\" which could subject him to further punishment under the league's substance abuse policy.\n\nNeither Peterson nor his lawyer had any comment on the running back's status with the league.\n\nWhatever action the league takes will likely be heavily critiqued after an offseason of off-field drama. Peterson's indictment was revealed after the league had absorbed criticism for how it handled the highly publicized domestic violence cases of Ray Rice and Greg Hardy.",

                    "body": "The NFL's horrific spate of off field crime, and the subsequent public relations disasters that came along with them (through both the sheer quantity and violent nature of the incidents, as well as the botched handling of them by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell), are well documented.\n\nRay Rice and Adrian Peterson, two of the top running backs in the NFL over the last decade, were the most famous of the perpetrators, Rice in the domestic abuse case against his then-fiancee, and Peterson in his child abuse case in Montgomery County involving his four year old son.\n\nAnd while Rice's appeal to his indefinite suspension is upcoming later this week, it appears that a resolution in the Peterson case may be on the horizon.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio, Peterson will reportedly plead no contest to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault. This comes with just a few weeks remaining before Peterson would stand trial to felony child abuse charges, charges to which Peterson has maintained his innocence:\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, Peterson will plead no contest to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault. The plea will not include reference to family violence or violence against a minor.\n\nIf the agreement is accepted by Judge Kelly Case, Peterson will pay a $2,000 fine, be placed on probation, and perform 80 hours of community service. Technically, the adjudication of the case will be deferred for two years.\n\nOnly Peterson and his attorney Rusty Hardin know the driving reasons behind Peterson's decision and change of heart to accepting a plea (as opposed to maintaining full innocence), but there is the chance now that he could get back on the field, depending on how the league and commissioner Roger Goodell decide to handle him.\n\nSince the charges were filed against Peterson back in early September, after Week 1 of the NFL season, the Vikings star running back has been on the Exempt/Commissioner's Permission List, which has essentially amounted to a paid suspension over the last eight weeks. It's fairly obvious that the league sees Peterson's transgressions as a punishable offense of some sort (why else would he be on the Exempt list?), but the question becomes do they see the time that he has been required to miss over the last several weeks as \"time served\"?\n\nAlso, if they do see it as \"time served,\" is eight games enough of a suspension, or will they tack more on? And because Peterson's been paid over that eight week time frame, will he have to pay a fine of some sort, given that suspensions for conduct policy are generally unpaid?\n\nIt will be interesting to see the public reaction to whatever the league decides to do, given how appalled the public was at Rice's initial two game suspension, and subsequently how spineless the league appeared when they banned Rice indefinitely after video surfaced with no new evidence of Rice doing anything except what he was suspended for in the first place. (I point that out not to defend Rice's actions, only to reinforce how haphazard and reactionary Goodell's discipline has been in the Rice case.)\n\nFlorio points out correctly, for the league, and maybe even more for Goodell, decisiveness is of the utmost importance. If the league has been doing their job in tandem with Peterson's legal saga, then hopefully they've been conferring with experts who can help them determine an appropriate punishment for an offense that everyone seems to realize has a lot more gray area than Rice's.\n\nIf the legal matters are all resolved this week, Peterson could theoretically be back on the field this weekend for the Vikings game with the Bears. Given reaction from several sponsors of the Vikings, though, when this story first broke, it may not be that simple.\n\nThe legal drama for Adrian Peterson appears to be over before it really started. His professional drama may just be beginning.",

                    "body": "Adrian Peterson pled no contest to a lesser charge of misdemeanor reckless assault, while not formally admitting guilt for violence against a minor or family violence. In doing so, he will avoid jail time as a first time offender, and will be placed on probation, pay a $4,000 fine, and have 80 hours of community service. The \"no contest\" plea allowed the judge to make findings on underlying facts presented by the prosecutor that Peterson will not contest, but Peterson doesn't make admissions that could be used against him in other proceedings (like a civil suit). Still, for NFL purposes, it is a resolution to his legal issues, and one which would allow the imposition of any further punishment.\n\nThe big issue now is what becomes of Adrian Peterson with the Minnesota Vikings. The Vikings, as you recall, were at first willing to let the legal process to play out, and let Peterson keep playing, until public outcry and the backlash from sponsors caused an about face. Goodell was under fire at the time in the immediate aftermath of the Ray Rice suspension. The resolution of Peterson going on the Exempt/Commissioner's Permission List was a face-saving compromise across all fronts. Goodell, taking on plenty of water, didn't have to jump in and have everyone question whatever decision he made. Peterson, facing public backlash and outcry, still got paid for agreeing to take time off. The Vikings, getting blasted publicly, were able to reverse course and get Peterson off the field in a situation that they vastly miscalculated.\n\nBut now, if it is resolved legally and Peterson has negotiated a result that keeps him from serving jail time? Remember, the rationale for putting him on this paid leave list:\n\nIn response, the League informed the team of the option to place Adrian on the Exempt/Commissioner's Permission list, which will require that Adrian remain away from all team activities while allowing him to take care of his personal situation until the legal proceedings are resolved. After giving the situation additional thought, we have decided this is the appropriate course of action for the organization and for Adrian.\n\nNow that the legal proceedings appear to be resolved, that rationale is gone. Now, it's a matter of where there is punishment. Of course, Goodell is a little tied up this week with testifying in the Ray Rice matter tomorrow. Still, this cannot be a situation that lingers. It's not as if there hasn't been two months to consider this scenario, which I thought seemed like the most likely outcome at the time the Vikings placed him on the exempt list. (\"My guess: this is able to get resolved fairly quickly, before the end of this current season, with pressure to return prompting action rather than delay from Peterson's perspective . . . they'll be able to resolve charges if the prosecutor will consider a plea bargain that does not involve jail time.\")\n\nShould the eight weeks be considered \"time served\" on a \"suspension but not officially a suspension\" scenario? After all, it was a *wink*wink*nudge*nudge* case of coming up with a little-used scenario. In any event, Peterson should not be on the exempt list anymore. The commissioner should act. My guess this time around? Peterson got paid during that period and it's not the same as a full suspension. I could see a hefty fine, and an additional 2-3 games with a date certain.\n\nWhen, in response to the Vikings' initial handling of Peterson's reinstatement in the face of clear statements by him in the investigation, and photos of injuries, I said it sent the wrong message, I also said:\n\nSo I don't know that there is a \"correct number of games\" that he must sit. I do know that the handling yesterday was not it. I'll be ready to watch Adrian Peterson again when I hear from him (not a slickly crafted press release written by someone else) that he is aware of what he did, did not intend harm, but now recognizes that he must change his behavior. I'll be ready when the Minnesota Vikings aren't ambivalent on whether or not leaving stripe marks on a child is appropriate.\n\nPeople make mistakes and we are forgiving. I don't think this is a case where Adrian Peterson cannot come back this year. I do think Goodell-for the first time in a while-needs to be the public face of the NFL and make a legitimate and quick decision.",

Looks like we called that one early: Sources say that AP is considering a plea deal that would put him on track to return to the NFL this year, rather than waiting for a Dec. 1 trial.\n\nSome of the details, via ProFootballTalk:\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, Peterson will plead no contest to one count of misdemeanor reckless assault. The plea will not include reference to family violence or violence against a minor.\n\nIf the agreement is accepted by Judge Kelly Case, Peterson will pay a $2,000 fine, be placed on probation, and perform 80 hours of community service. Technically, the adjudication of the case will be deferred for two years.\n\nAccording to the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the conclusion of AP's legal proceedings won't mean an automatic reinstatement. \"Maybe in time\" says Rapoport, though what the NFL would use as the basis for further suspension of AP (he's already missed eight games, with pay) isn't clear. Meanwhile, Chris Mortensen said on NFL Insiders that it's \"very possible\" the Vikings will have their highly-paid star back this year, after originally planning to move on without him.\n\nThe bottom line: It will be up to the league office -- namely, Roger \"All The Power\" Goodell -- to decide whether Peterson plays again this year. It's interesting to note that AP's plea deal won't refer to family violence, which might place it outside the jurisdiction of the NFL's new domestic violence policy. Then again, who fucking knows with these guys? The league's track record with doling out appropriate punishments this year (and every year, really) has been horrendous. They risk a fight with the NFLPA if they come down too hard on him, and public backlash if they let him play next week.\n\nRegardless, from a fantasy perspective, you should probably grab and stash AP. He's worth it.",

                    "body": "You may have noticed from your e-mail that semi-hysterical appeals for money were still coming as late as last night. MPR's Catharine Richert says, \"In the 8th Congressional District, where DFL Rep. Rick Nolan is facing a challenge from Republican Stewart Mills, gun rights groups and Democrats in Washington have poured roughly $450,000 into the race since last Friday. ... The Minnesota Jobs Coalition, which is levying attacks on vulnerable DFL House members, has raised an additional $60,000 in the last few days. Half of that came from the Washington, D.C.-based Republican State Leadership Committee, which has already given the group $325,000 to spend promoting Republicans running for the Minnesota House.\"\n\nThe AP says, \"This campaign was markedly different from [Gov.] Dayton's bid four years ago, which was so close it spilled into a recount. Dayton and [Jeff] Johnson spent far less, as did outside groups. Independence Party candidate Hannah Nicollet was far less visible than previous third-party hopefuls and polled in the single digits. Dayton, 67, is in his final campaign of a four-decade career that included stints as state auditor and U.S. senator -- walking away from each after one term.\"\n\nIn its final word on the campaign, WCCO-TV says, \"If the top races are resolved early, Minnesota's midterm will still have something for people who enjoy staying up late to watch election returns. It's the battle for control of the Minnesota House -- scores of races that fly under the media radar but determine the makeup of a body that may have a more direct impact on people than the glamorous federal races. This is especially true when one party controls all the levers of government, as Democrats have done since 2012. During the last two years they raised the minimum wage, legalized gay marriage and increased school spending.\"\n\nAnd in a bit finer detail, Jesse Marx at City Pages reports, \"America, Inc., a Virginia-based Super PAC, has spent twice as much money to defeat Independence Party candidate John Denney than Denney has on hand. A review of FEC reports of independent expenditures in Minnesota's sixth congressional district race shows that the group dropped $8,000 in early October on 'Online/Digital Ads & Production' against Denney. Then last Friday, it dropped another $1,250 for the same purpose. ... Headed by conservative author David Bozell, America, Inc., defines itself in the typical Tea Party rhetoric: 'personal freedom, personal responsibility, a commitment to Judeo-Christian values, and a strong national defense.' The Super PAC has gone after candidates on both sides of the aisle, but tends to throw its support behind Republicans who share at least one thing in common: a revulsion to same-sex marriage and abortion.\"\n\nRelated to the campaign ... The Minnesota Daily editorial board would like ... more money for the U. \"The University of Minnesota's biennial budget request for 2016-17 includes a $6.25 million provision for mining research. The 'mining solutions' initiative is part of the University's economic and community development plan. Funding would develop ways to harness mining waste products, make mining research and information more accessible, and address the harmful health and environmental effects of mining. ... The $6.25 million the University has requested for this initiative is consistent with the amounts for its other research projects and initiatives. And given the economic importance of mining for Minnesota -- plus the health and environmental concerns it causes -- this proposed research will be valuable not just for academic purposes, but for the whole state.\"\n\nA juicy tale of young lust from KMSP-TV's Maury Glover: \"By his own account, Cameron Clarkson's senior year at Cretin-Derham Hall should have been the best of his life. He was captain of the football team, and with players like Seantrell Henderson, the Raiders won their second state title in 10 years. However, the All-American teenager was carrying a devastating secret, one that would eventually derail his dreams of playing college football and test his faith, both in the institution that was his home for 4 years, and in himself. ... it put him on a collision course with another Cretin grad who abused her position as a substitute teacher and weight room supervisor to have a sex with the then 16-year-old boy. Gail Gagne is the granddaughter of legendary Minnesota wrestler, Vern Gagne, and the daughter of his equally famous tag team partner and son, Greg, but to the boys at Cretin, she was a young, hot teacher.\" Depositions in the case have been released.\n\nIt never hurts to be wealthy and famous. ESPN's Michele Steele reports, \"Running back Adrian Peterson has reached a plea deal in his child-abuse case and is not expected to serve any jail time, a source confirmed to ESPN's Michele Steele. Peterson will enter a plea Tuesday afternoon to a lesser charge than the felony child-abuse charge that he is currently facing, the source confirmed. The Minnesota Vikings star, who has been on the commissioner's exempt list since being indicted in September, will enter a plea to one misdemeanor count of reckless assault, according to the source. Peterson's plea deal was reporter earlier Tuesday by ProFootballTalk.com, which also reported that the plea will not include any references to family violence or violence against a minor. If Judge Kelly Case accepts the plea, Peterson will be placed on probation, pay a $2,000 fine and perform 80 hours of community service, according to ProFootballTalk.com.\"\n\nA Strib piece says, \"Talking with reporters at Winter Park on Tuesday, Vikings general manager Rick Spielman had little to say about Peterson. 'All I'm going to say is basically at the appropriate time, and I know you guys can appreciate this, we'll keep all of our comments under the Adrian situation until it's appropriate to speak,\" Spielman said. ... Asked when the appropriate time would be -- after all, there were rumblings that Peterson was about to agree to a plea deal down in Texas that would allow him to avoid jail time -- Spielman responded, 'We'll let everybody know.' \"\n\nInteresting piece from Strib sports writer Chip Scoggins on a possible Peterson return to the Vikings. \"Team officials realize that a segment of fans probably never want to see Peterson in a Vikings uniform again, and that makes them nervous. At a minimum, the NFL, if permissible, should fine Peterson the amount that he has been paid while on the exempt list, which is roughly $4.8 million at present. The next step should hinge largely on Peterson's reaction to his mistakes. ... Peterson's actions were deplorable. But there's also a place in this world for forgiveness and redemption if -- and let's make this perfectly clear -- Peterson shows genuine remorse and a true desire to make meaningful changes.\" From the sound of it to date I'm not sure he even understands he did something wrong.\n\nMnSCU Chancellor Steven Rosenstone's popularity with faculty members is not improving. At MPR, Alex Friedrich reports, \"Leaders of the faculty association at Southwest Minnesota State University yesterday joined colleagues at other campuses by passing a vote of no confidence in Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) system Chancellor Steven Rosenstone. Here's a response from MnSCU communication chief Kim Olson: We have, once again, received notice from the media that a faculty senate has issued a vote of \"no confidence\" in Chancellor Steven Rosenstone. We continue to be disappointed that the faculty union leaders are employing this tactic to further their goal of stopping the critical conversations that make up Charting the Future ... .\"\n\nOh, and in case you're enjoying the pleasant weather a little too much ... . Paul Huttner at MPR writes, \"All systems appear go for the strongest cold front of the fall season by Saturday. Two waves of frigid air from inside the Arctic Circle sail south toward Minnesota into early next week. Another clipper sails through with the potential for accumulating snow Sunday ahead of the colder, second arctic style front. With chilly winds and highs in the 30s this weekend, the change will get your attention. Highs in the metro may not climb out of the upper 20s by next Tuesday.\"",

                    "body": "Now that Adrian Peterson has agreed to a plea bargain, people are beginning to speculate when, not necessarily if, he will return to the Vikings in 2014. Let's take a look at some things from a few different perspectives, and see how this might play out.\n\nThe NFLPA will advocate for Peterson to get back on the field as soon as possible. They are his union representation, and that's their job. If I was NFLPA President DeMaurice Smith, I would be in front of every camera arguing that he has essentially served the NFL Domestic Abuse penalty (six games) and then some. The only thing that really makes the Commissioner's Exempt List not a true suspension is the fact that he's been getting paid--he's not been to the facility, and he's had little to no contact with the team. Peterson makes $700,000 per game, so even if they fine him one game check, that's a huge amount, way above and beyond what a normal fine would be.\n\nIf the NFLPA offers NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a deal to let him play if Goodell counts the eight games as a time served suspension, and AP throws in a game check fine, it seems like a reasonable compromise. Anything's possible, of course, and Goodell could say no. I'm no lawyer, but if I was one for the NFLPA and he does reject that plan, I'd be pretty comfortable taking that case in front of an arbitrator.\n\nThe Vikings want him back, at least Mike Zimmer does. The few times he's mentioned AP, he's complimented him as a great person, and an asset to the team. Rick Spielman and Zygi Wilf have remained quiet, but they initially reinstated him after the Patriots game, before everything blew up. I don't think that the Vikings will impose any further suspension if the NFL reinstates him, but again, anything is possible. And from a football perspective, to say him returning to the field for the final seven games would be a lift is a huge understatement\n\nFinally, the fans. I caught Hell advocating that the Vikings should have cut AP when all this went down. This whole situation pretty much started a Civil War amongst the fan base, and I'm not here to re-ignite it. Americans, as a people, are a very forgiving society, and now that this will be adjudicated, and his punishment from the courts and the league handed down, I sense most fans will want to move on from this. People believe in second chances, and Peterson will get one with a lot of folks. Will there be people who will quit cheering for the Minnesota Vikings if Adrian Peterson wears their jersey again? Yes, I'm sure there will be. But there are probably just as many more fans that will welcome him back with open arms, and think he's already been out long enough. So if the Vikings do re-instate him, the outcry won't be nearly as vociferous as it was when this incident first came to light. Well, at least I don't think it will. Again, I could be way wrong on this, but if Twitter is any indication of public sentiment, there seems to be a lot more 'second chance' types of feelings out there than there are 'suspend him for the year'.\n\nSo, when will AP come back to the team? If you're going to make me say when, this can happen very quickly, as long as Roger Goodell doesn't impose a further suspension that will be appealed by the NFLPA. If he doesn't, there's a very realistic chance he'll play at Chicago in two weeks, coming off the bye. If not then, certainly in time for the Packers game at home the following week.\n\nWhat seemed like an impossibility two months ago now seems, in some respects, like a foregone conclusion.",
