We demand a Russia that is free,\" Tolokonnikova told the crowd.\n \"Now Russia will be free,\" the pair chanted, thanking Madonna and saying they were \"overjoyed\" by her support.\n The duo were sentenced to 21 months in jail for hooliganism after performing a stunt inside a Moscow cathedral.\n Although the stunt was unpopular among ordinary Russians, their trial and sentence turned them into dissident stars in the West.\n They were released two months early in December as part of a pre-Sochi amnesty.  But they have vowed no let up in their campaign against Putin's crackdown on civil liberties.\n Organized by Amnesty International, Wednesday's concert whipped up a crowd of thousands crammed into one of New York's largest music and sporting venues with a maximum capacity of 18,000.\n Blondie, fronted by a still electric Debbie Harry, brought the house down with their hits \"Call Me\" and \"One Way or Another\".\n US pop and rock bands Imagine Dragons, who also paid tribute to Pussy Riot, Flaming Lips, Cake, the Fray and Cold War Kids fired up the crowd who danced and cheered from their seats.\n Grammy-winning American soul singer Lauryn Hill, who spent three months in a US prison last year for failing to file her tax returns, also performed a set to wild cheers from loyal fans.\n US actress Susan Sarandon introduced the concert and there were pre-taped messages from the likes of Peter Gabriel and Sting.\n The Sochi Winter Olympics have opened up a new front of distrust between the United States and Russia, and tensions over security preparations amid fears the games could be attacked by extremists.\n They are the first Olympics held in Russia since the US boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and have added to the host of issues, including the Syrian civil war, that have divided the countries.\n Relations reached a nadir last summer after Moscow gave asylum to Snowden and President Barack Obama scrapped a planned visit.\n Moscow also reacted angrily to US charges in December against 49 current and former Russian diplomats and their wives for fraud.\n Amnesty says that Pussy Riot represent a young generation of Russians standing up to repressive laws introduced under Putin.\n Irish singer Bob Geldof called on a younger generation of Americans to campaign for human rights and blasted through his \"I Don't Like Mondays\" hit to a dwindling audience.\n Speaking earlier, he compared Pussy Riot to the Sex Pistols and urged people to take a stand about rights issues in general.\n \"I hope tonight it's not all gloopy and American and gets straight to the heart of the matter,\" Geldof told AFP.",

But they have vowed no let up in their campaign against Putin's crackdown on civil liberties.\n Organised by Amnesty International, Wednesday's concert whipped up a crowd of thousands crammed into one of New York's largest music and sporting venues with a maximum capacity of 18,000.\n Blondie, fronted by Debbie Harry, brought the house down with their hits Call Me and One Way or Another.\n US pop and rock band Imagine Dragons, Flaming Lips, Cake, The Fray and Cold War Kids fired up the crowd who danced and cheered form their seats.\n American actor Susan Sarandon introduced the concert and there were pre-taped messages from the likes of Peter Gabriel and Sting.\n The Sochi Winter Olympics have opened up a new front of distrust between the US and Russia, as well as tensions over security preparations amid fears the Games could be attacked by extremists.\n They are the first Olympics held in Russia since the US boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n Relations reached a nadir in 2013 after Moscow gave asylum to Snowden and President Barack Obama scrapped a planned visit.\n Moscow also reacted angrily to US charges in December against 49 current and former Russian diplomats and their wives for fraud.\n Amnesty says that Pussy Riot represent a young generation of Russians standing up to repressive laws introduced under Putin.\n AFP",

The world's attention, they said, was instrumental to their struggle.\n \"The support and care shown internationally around the world made us free even though, physically, we were behind bars\" said Maria Alyokhina, 25.  \"This is certainly not the time for us to be afraid,\" added Tolokonnikova.\n The two women received top billing at an Amnesty International benefit concert at the Barclays Center in New York City on Wednesday night, alongside Madonna, Yoko Ono, Blondie and Lauryn Hill, among other pop idols.  They also met the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power.  So much for silencing the jailbirds.",

                    "body": "Como una canci\u00f3n de las Pussy Riot.  As\u00ed podr\u00edamos calificar a este documental producido por la HBO.  La m\u00fasica es lo de menos: lo importante es la letra, el discurso.  'Pussy Riot: Una plegaria punk' es pura denuncia; un documental militante, de tesis, que apenas disimula su gusto por la manipulaci\u00f3n, por el montaje tendencioso a lo Michael Moore.  Que nadie espere un an\u00e1lisis sutil, sosegado y objetivo.  Como dice la cita de Bertolt Brecht con la que se abre la pel\u00edcula, \"el arte no es una herramienta para reflejar el mundo, sino un martillo con el que darle forma\".\n Los directores Mike Lerner y Maxim Pozdorovkines lo dejan claro desde el principio: esto es un grito contra Putin y el patriarca ortodoxo Cirilo, una protesta en im\u00e1genes contra la desproporcionada reacci\u00f3n de la justicia rusa al condenar a dos a\u00f1os de c\u00e1rcel a tres miembros de Pussy Riot por interpretar una performance, una \"plegaria punk\", en la catedral ortodoxa m\u00e1s importante del pa\u00eds.  El documental termina con la liberaci\u00f3n de solo una de ellas, aunque, como es sabido, luego fueron absueltas las otras dos.\n Pero quiz\u00e1 lo m\u00e1s interesante del documental no est\u00e9 en el discurso central, sino en los m\u00e1rgenes.  Primero: la propia existencia de la pel\u00edcula y su repercusi\u00f3n (gan\u00f3 en Sundance y estuvo preseleccionada para los Oscar) dejan muy claro lo mal que han manejado el caso los dirigentes rusos.  Quiz\u00e1 sea el efecto de tantos a\u00f1os protegidos y aislados por el tel\u00f3n de acero, pero es como si no conocieran la existencia de internet o conceptos como la globalizaci\u00f3n.\n Segundo: el punk sigue vivo.  No en Occidente, claro, incorporado desde hace a\u00f1os al sistema, pero s\u00ed en otras latitudes.  Como se desprende del documental, el caso de las Pussy Riot pone de manifiesto que, en pa\u00edses como Rusia, la actitud punk sigue resultando tremendamente eficaz como arma de agitaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica y social.  Blasfemar en una canci\u00f3n contin\u00faa siendo trasgresor y provocador.  Ofende a muchos.  Al gobierno y a la Iglesia, pero tambi\u00e9n al pueblo -a la madre de una de las activistas- poco acostumbrado a este tipo de irreverencias y desaf\u00edos a la autoridad.\n Y tercero: resulta curioso (y hasta divertido) comprobar c\u00f3mo los directores, a pesar de su intenci\u00f3n de (re)tratar a las tres activistas por igual, son incapaces de escapar al influjo de Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, de no sentirse atra\u00eddos por el magnetismo y el carisma que desprende la \"guapa de las Pussy Riot\".  Si fuera una actriz la llamar\u00edamos \"robaplanos\" o que \"la c\u00e1mara la quiere\".  \u00bfHa nacido una estrella de la militancia pol\u00edtica? 7.",
