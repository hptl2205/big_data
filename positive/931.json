                    "body": "Keira Knightley's recent appearance at the Moet British Independent Film Awards has reignited rumors that the actress is pregnant. Though Knightley and husband, James Righton, have not confirmed the rumors, talk of an addition to the family has floated around since November.\n\nPage Six says that multiple sources have confirmed the pregnancy, and that Keira is well past her third month of pregnancy. This would be Knightley's first child. Though the award show was sponsored by Moet, Keira avoided drinking. Also, Keira's loose-fitting Rocha dress that she wore is a departure from her usual style. Rumors first began in November when gossip magazines circulated that the star could be expecting.\n\nThe source said that Keira has been focused on covering up her growing pregnancy.\n\n\"Keira and her stylist have been putting together looks that hide her growing bump.\"\n\nDon't expect Keira to be a stay-at-home mom. When she spoke to Vogue in 2013, Knightley said that she would not give up acting if she and Righton did have children.\n\n\"Would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No. On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.\"\n\nHello Magazine says that Keira has also been vocal recently about starting a family. Knightley said she would be hesitant about encouraging her children to take up the acting profession.\n\n\"It can be completely heartbreaking for most people who do it, because the amount of rejection is enormous. And it doesn't matter what kind of person you are, it's impossible for that not to take a toll... So I would say to my daughter, 'Be a doctor or a lawyer - something stable and useful.'\"\n\nKeira was nominated on Wednesday for a Screen Actors Guild supporting actress award for her role as Joan Clarke in The Imitation Game. Her co-star Benedict Cumberbatch was also nominated for a SAG award. Other nominated actresses include Meryl Streep for Into the Woods, Naomi Watts for St. Vincent, Emma Stone in Birdman, and Patricia Arquette in Boyhood.\n\nKeira married her husband James Righton in May 2013. Righton is a co-vocalist and keyboardist for the Klaxons, a London-based pop band.\n\nKnightley also sparked controversy for her recent photo shoot with Patrick Demarchalier. Keira posed topless for the shoot and demanded that her photos remain unedited to protest Photoshop editing of women's bodies, as reported by the Inquisitr.\n\nAs Keira is concerned about covering up her baby bump, it seems unlikely that the star will confirm these sources any time soon.\n\n[Photo Source: Harpers Bazaar]",

She was spotted avoiding alcohol at Sunday's Moet British Independent Spirit Awards, and was wearing a loose-fitting gown outfit in contrast to her usual tight-fit style, which prompted professional celebrity spotters to speculate whether the actress was expecting.\n\nIn the past few days, Knightley has celebrated a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination and a Golden Globe nod for her role in The Imitation Game, the film concerning British WW2 codebreaker Alan Turing and starring Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nMore: Keira Knightley says topless photoshoot was in order to protest the use of Photoshop\n\nIn an interview with Vogue back in 2012 she spoke of her desire to have children in the future, but that she intended to maintain her career at the same time. \"Would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No. On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.\"\n\nIn an interview with Glamour this year, she reiterated her point. \"I mean, not to have the freedom to do that [if you are male] is as bad as saying it's a woman's duty to look after the children.\" With her husband's band no longer in operation, it seems as though Righton will be being expected to pull his weight with the childcare.\n\nMore: Gone Girl wins top honour and The Imitation Game wins 4 awards at Hollywood Film Awards",

No,\" she said. \"On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.\"\n\nWhen speaking with Elle U.K. in June, Keira was asked if she would encourage her hypothetical teenage daughter to be an actress.\n\n\"Oh, 100%, I'd absolutely tell her not to. I would 150 million trillion per cent be totally discouraging of [her] doing anything like that.\"\n\nShe continued, \"If the kid is going to do that then they have to do it on their own. And I would say teenage years should be done privately. You should be going out and getting unbelievably drunk, getting into ridiculous situations, making mistakes. That's what that time of life is about and we should do that privately, one million trillion zillion per cent. Saying that, I don't regret it -- I wouldn't do my life any differently.\"\n\nWhile it is unknown whether Keira has a little girl or boy on the way, one thing is for sure... her maternity style is going to be awesome this awards season.",

But would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No. On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.'\n\nSpeaking to Elle UK last summer, Keira appeared to have children on the brain when she discussed her fantasy film script.\n\nShe said of the imagined plot: 'The horrendous issue of trying to have a baby when you can't.\n\n'I've seen friends who've been through this, it seems like one of the most dramatic things that can happen to half of the population - and actually, the other half as well because, my god, the unbelievable toll it takes on male partners - and there are no good films about it.'\n\nIn recent weeks, Keira has been jet-setting to the UK, US and China - among other destinations - on the promotional trail for The Imitation Game, but has displayed no visible signs of a baby bump at any of her numerous photocalls.\n\nKeira and Klaxons star James started dating in February 2011, before tying the knot in an intimate ceremony in Mazan, a small town in the South of France, back in May 2013, with just 11 guests in attendance.\n\nSpeaking to NME about their nuptials, James recently said: 'It was the greatest day ever, it was fantastic. We're still high from it. It was about two weeks ago, it was a big party.\n\n'I just fell in love with someone who happens to be amazing. We had a beautiful wedding and there was a lot of love.'\n\nSpeaking to Glamour magazine in June, Keira joked that she decided to get married because it 'seemed like a fun thing to do'.\n\n'When James proposed, I just thought, \"Well, never done that before\". It seemed like a fun thing to do,' she confessed.\n\nThe actress impressed fashion critics with her rather thrifty approach to bridal glamour, choosing a couture Chanel wedding dress she had previously worn to a red carpet event five years previously.\n\nBut Keira later admitted the wedding was the gown's last outing, after a friend accidentally knocked a glass of red wine down her on her big day.\n\nShe explained: 'It's now got red wine spilled down the front because the last time I wore it my friend went like this [she juts out her elbows] and now it's everywhere. I didn't quite realise the extent of it until I got home.\n\n'It's quite impressively splattered. But, hey, a good night is a good night and when a dress has had its time, maybe it's had its time.\n\n'I'm pretty sure I can get it out but, if I can't, I'm happy with the memory of a good night and the story of how the dress got destroyed.'\n\nPrior to her romance with James, Keira had long-term relationships with Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan and Homeland's Rupert Friend\n\nIn October 2015, Keira is set to make her Broadway debut when she takes on the role of a doomed heroine in a new stage adaptation of Therese Raquin, British playwright Helen Edmundson's adaptation of the French classic 1867 novel by Emile Zola.",

Hurrah.\n\nRumours have been rife that Keira was expecting after she stepped out in numerous baggy outfits and was noted to be snubbing alcohol at the Moet sponsored British Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday night. The 29-year-old Hollywood actress is reportedly \"more than three months\" pregnant with the Klaxons singer's baby, and the news has been confirmed by \"several sources\" to Page Six.\n\nKeira and James got hitched in May 2013 in the south of France, but she has been quizzed on the subject of babies several times in recent years, During a chat with Vogue back in 2012 she gave her take on whether or not she believed in being a stay at home mum.\n\nKeira Knightley and James Righton at The Spirit Awards on Sunday (WENN)\n\nShe said: \"I'm glad that the subject is coming up again. I remember doing interviews, and people would ask, as if it was a joke, 'So you mean you are a feminist?' As though feminism couldn't be discussed unless we were making fun of it. I don't want to deny my femininity. But would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No. On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.\"\n\nAnd this summer Keira continued the debate - hinting that she thinks Dad's should be free to share the responsibility of giving up work to care for their baby.\n\nShe said: \"I think it's about equality. I was talking to a male friend about this the other day who's just had a baby girl, and because he's the one staying home to look after her, he went to this mother-and-baby class, and all the mothers were going, 'Oh, is the baby having a day with Dad?' I mean, not to have the freedom to do that [if you are male] is as bad as saying it's a woman's duty to look after the children.\"",

I can't wait to celebrate with everyone.'\n\nShe is also up for a Screen Actors Guild prize for the same role.\n\nWith the Golden Globe and SAG nods under her belt, Keira is now hotly-tipped to receive a nomination for the biggest movie awards of them all, the Oscars.\n\nKeira made a high-profile red carpet appearance on Sunday night at the Moet British Independent Film Awards, displaying no visible signs of a baby bump in an embroidered ivory fur-trimmed dress by Rocha.\n\nThe British star is said to have 'steered clear from any champagne or alcohol' throughout the night, where she presented her The Imitation Game co-star Benedict Cumberbatch with the Variety Award alongside Mark Strong.\n\nThe Atonement actress - who has been with Klaxons rocker James, 31, since February 2011 - has made no secret of her desire to have children, but has previously insisted she would never give up her career to raise a family.\n\nSpeaking in 2012, she told Vogue magazine: 'I don't want to deny my femininity. But would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No. On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.'\n\nSpeaking to Elle UK last summer, Keira appeared to have children on the brain when she discussed her fantasy film script.\n\nShe said of the imagined plot: 'The horrendous issue of trying to have a baby when you can't.\n\n'I've seen friends who've been through this, it seems like one of the most dramatic things that can happen to half of the population - and actually, the other half as well because, my god, the unbelievable toll it takes on male partners - and there are no good films about it.'\n\nIn recent weeks, Keira has been jet-setting to the UK, US and China - among other destinations - on the promotional trail for The Imitation Game, but has displayed no visible signs of a baby bump at any of her numerous photocalls.",

But an official announcement was made this afternoon\n\nShe steered clear of the alcohol at the booze-fuelled event and was wearing a dress that was not her usual fitted style. Baby rumours have been batted around the internet since November.\n\nKeira was seen earlier this year supporting her husband's band Klaxons at their gig at The Hare and Hounds in King's Heath.\n\nShe went fairly unnoticed by the crowd as she danced near the back of the room, but she was spotted by Jake Regan, of Selly Park, who snapped a selfie with the star.\n\nHe said: \"It's not everyday you get the chance to meet a Hollywood megastar in a Birmingham boozer.\"\n\nShe was then photographed leaving the venue with a bottle of red wine stashed in her handbag.\n\nKeira and James married in a low-key ceremony in France last year and the couple now live in Islington, London.\n\nJames grew up in Stratford and went to Stratford-upon-Avon High School where he met band member Simon Taylor-Davis.\n\nThe down to earth couple were spotted enjoying a family Christmas drink in Stratford pub, the Old Thatch Tavern, in 2012.\n\nKeira has previously said how she wishes to start a family with James, but will not give up her acting career once she becomes a mother.\n\nShe told Vogue in 2013: \"Would I want to be a stay-at-home mother? No. On the other hand, you should be allowed to do that, as should men, without being sneered at.\"\n\nIt has been a week of good news for the star as she celebrates Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations for best supporting actress for her role alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in Second World War film, The Imitation Game.",

A rep confirmed that Keira is in fact pregnant but won't be making any further comment.\n\nThe reason that everyone was so suspicious about Keira's potential baby bump was because of her noticeably shifted style. The stylish actress has been seen out and about more recently in distinctly looser-fitted getups. Her slim figure is usually kitted out in tight dresses but for her last few events, she has opted for chiffon dresses which don't give too much away.\n\nKeeping it super casual while out and about in New York just a few weeks ago, Keira looked effortlessly cool in a pair of baggy dungarees - but it was this pic that sent the rumour mill into overdrive.\n\nShe was on the Jonathon Ross show recently in a baggy chiffon dress and although she displayed no obious signs of a baby bump, the flowing gown certainly differed from many of her tighter-fitting red carpet looks we have seen in the past, like this Chanel dress from March.\n\nShe also wore a loose-fitted white floral dress by Holly Fulton during her New York trip and the winning pink Dolce number also had us convinced. These (very early days) maternity looks provide some serious style inspiration and we can't wait to see what she will wear when her bump becomes a little more visible.\n\nKeira joins the likes of Blake Lively and Kate Middleton in the seriously stylish mums-to-be group at the moment. We wonder if they have been swapping notes on how to totally rock their bumps.\n\nCongratulations to Keira! We can't wait to see your maternity looks in full.",

Yes, lots of rumours are all of a sudden doing the rounds that the Pirates of the Caribbean lady will be making a tinier version of herself.\n\nA mini-Knightley mixed with a mini Klaxon, eh? So what's all this about?\n\nWell, according to New York Post's Page Six , they claim to have the exclusive that the reason Keira wore a loose dress recently, is because there was a BABY WITHIN. Oh, so boho isn't back? What the hell are we going to do with all these floral crowns? Bulk-sell them to Pixie Lott?\n\nAnyway, it hasn't been confirmed by the lady herself yet, but Page Six seem pretty defiant she is. She's been married to James from the Klaxons since 2013 now, so that's probably been enough time to get through all the Netflix tv shows they wanted to watch, and now they can create a life instead?\n\nKeira's been busy recently standing next to Benedict Cumberbatch because of that Alan Turing film we haven't watched yet, where everyone in it is supposed to be getting Oscars, because it's a British film about a real person. The same as when The Kings' Speech won all those Oscars.\n\nAnyway, we will watch Keira's cervis INTENTLY for the next few weeks to see if the rumours are true, and if they are, we sincerely hope she calls the little one Love Actually.\n\nUpdate:: A representative of Keira Knightley confirmed the joyful news so she definitely is having a baby Love Actually!

And with the debut of Oscar de la Renta's pre-fall 2015 collection this week, that hunt for award show gowns got a whole lot easier.\n\nThe 34 pieces are part of the last collection bearing the fingerprints of the late designer, who passed away in October at the age of 82. The New York Times reviewed the collection, which was completed by his studio director Laura Kim, and about which Kim said, \"We tried to make it like he's still here with us. We made big ball gowns, like he likes them.\" And since Hollywood loves a big ballgown too, we picked three dresses for three Golden Globe-nominated stars to honor his legacy on the red carpet.\n\nCourtesy of Oscar de la Renta; Inset: Tim P. Whitby/Getty\n\nJennifer Aniston: We're not expecting the Cake actress to go all-out gown at the Globes, but we are expecting her to wear black. This strapless lace design adds some excitement thanks to the gorgeous gold embroidery (and the sheer skirt!). Plus, the midi length would stand out amid all the floor-skimming dresses that are bound to hit the carpet.\n\nCourtesy Oscar de la Renta; Inset: Jim Spellman/WireImage\n\nEmily Blunt: The actress has been jumping into some whimsical dressing territory as she promotes Into the Woods (which nabbed her a nom for Best Actress!), and we're thinking she should keep it that way. This gorgeous floral gown would not only be a hat tip to her film, but also to the impeccable detailing Oscar de la Renta gowns are known for.\n\nKeira Knightley: From the color to the drop waist to the interesting hemline, this dress was made for Keira Knightley.
