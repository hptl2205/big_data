                    "body": "BANGKOK -- There is a lot of talk in Thailand about \"the people\" and what they want.\n Suthep Thaugsuban, the leader of the protests that have taken over several of the capital's busiest intersections this week, says the people demand that the government give up power because of corruption and other misdeeds.\n Supporters of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra say the people should be allowed to choose their leaders in elections set for Feb. 2, and that their opponents reject the vote only because they know they won't win.\n Then there are the people who love neither the ruling Pheu Thai Party nor the opposition Democrats, who have boycotted the election and are calling for an unelected interim government to oversee political reforms.  These people are concerned that tensions, which already have left eight people dead and hundreds injured in recent weeks, could turn even more violent.  They hope for an end to the political conflict that has flared on and off since Yingluck's brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted in a 2006 coup.\n Below are several Thais, some prominent, some ordinary, explaining their views on the political unrest:\n---\nBuddhipongse Punnakanta is a leader of the People's Democratic Reform Committee, the group organizing the \"Shut Down Bangkok\" protest:\n\"I think we've made the right decision (in shutting down Bangkok) but it will take time because we are here peacefully.  This is the only way to lead the people to win.\n \"Once the prime minister and the Cabinet ministers step down from their caretaker posts, once a person trusted by the people is chosen to replace the premier, we're definitely going home.  We just don't know when that day will come.\n \"Once reforms are completed, the new rules are set and everyone is satisfied, then an election takes place.  Even if it turns out Ms. Yingluck still wins an election and becomes the prime minister again.  Go ahead.  I'm not going to come out and tell her to leave because she wins under the rules that we accept as the best.\" \"\n---\nChumpolpatra Pinyorashadapong sells whistles, a symbol of the protest movement, near a rally site in Bangkok's shopping district.  Some are stainless steel, others are studded with plastic gems, and others feature the Hello Kitty character and the red, white and blue of the Thai flag:\n\"I've sold more than 20,000 whistles in the protest since Nov. 24.  Some of these whistles are imported from China and we put Thai national flag decorations on them.  It sells like hotcakes to all kinds of people.\n \"Sure, there's a huge profit from doing this, but at one point I think we have to stop protesting to let the country move on.\" \"\n---\nSombat Boonngamanong is a prominent activist with the Red Shirts, a group close to Thaksin and Pheu Thai.  In 2010, when the Democrat Party ruled, Red Shirt protesters took over central Bangkok before the army drove them out in clashes that left more than 90 people dead:\n\"I believe that there will be an election.  An election might not be the solution to this conflict but if there's no election, I believe the situation will get far worse than this.  You're saying this election is full of conflict and violence; I'm saying without an election, the situation will turn gravely violent.  This is because there will be no rules to follow.\n \"The Red Shirts are being patient, but they are resentful.  People outside might not be able to feel it, but it's like an arrow that is being drawn back so tightly.  Only one flick and it's going to be released with so much power.

It was welcomed by Thai opposition protesters who have staged days of anti-government demonstrations in Bangkok calling for Mrs. Yingluck to step down.\n Under the program, the government purchased rice from Thai farmers for above market prices.  The government is now stuck with large stockpiles of rice it has been unable to sell.\n Critics say the program cost the country millions of dollars.  They say Mrs. Yingluck used the initiative to win support among the rural population, which represents the main base of her ruling Pheu Thai party.\n It is yet to be seen whether the announcement will breathe life into the opposition protest movement, which is showing signs of losing momentum.\n Opposition protesters marched outside government revenue offices in Bangkok on Thursday.  Though thousands showed up for the march, and many more remained camped out in key intersections throughout the city, the numbers are dwindling.\n Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban is calling for an unelected people's council to replace the current government, which he says is corrupt and engages in nepotism.\n Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has refused to step down.  She insists on holding early elections on February 2, though the opposition has said it will boycott the polls.\n This week's protests have been peaceful, as police have largely stayed away and avoided conflict.  But the protesters have also been unsuccessful at shutting the government down, as they had planned.\n Thailand has experienced regular political turmoil in recent years.  The conflict pits Bangkok's urban middle class and royalist elite against the mostly poor, rural supporters of Ms. Yingluck and her brother, ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\n Mr. Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, remains very influential in Thailand, even though he was convicted of corruption and lives in self-imposed exile.\n Mrs. Yingluck's Pheu Thai party is expected to easily win the February vote, thanks to the popularity of her brother, who remains popular in part because of social welfare programs he enacted.",

Su cifra podr\u00eda aumentar nuevamente este fin de semana.\n Los adversarios de Yingluck, en su mayor\u00eda de las clases medias y altas del sur y las urbes del pa\u00eds, dicen que ella sigue las pr\u00e1cticas de su multimillonario hermano al utilizar la fortuna de la familia y fondos estatales para influir en los votantes y afianzarse al poder.\n Pero ella cuenta con apoyo amplio entre la mayor\u00eda pobre de Tailandia de las zonas rurales campo debido a las pol\u00edticas populistas realizadas por su hermano, el ex primer ministro Thaksin Shinawatra, quien vive en el autoexilio para evitar ser encarcelado por una condena por corrupci\u00f3n.\n Las protestas de esta semana han sido mayormente pac\u00edficas, aunque se han registrado varios actos de violencia a medianoche en sitios de reuni\u00f3n de manifestantes y se han lanzado explosivos como fuegos artificiales peque\u00f1os a las casas de l\u00edderes de la protesta, seg\u00fan la polic\u00eda.\n Desde el inicio en noviembre de la ola m\u00e1s reciente de protestas, han muerto al menos ocho personas y han resultado heridas m\u00e1s de 450.\n A pesar de la presi\u00f3n de los manifestantes, Yingluck ha dicho reiteradamente que se realizar\u00e1 la elecci\u00f3n parlamentaria del 2 de febrero.  Ella disolvi\u00f3 el Parlamento y llam\u00f3 a una elecci\u00f3n adelantada para desactivar la presi\u00f3n que ha crecido en los \u00faltimos tres meses.",

Su fotograf\u00eda ocup\u00f3 las portadas de los diarios locales, recorri\u00f3 las redes sociales y desvel\u00f3 las aspiraciones revolucionarias de la heredera de uno de los principales imperios econ\u00f3micos de Tailandia, levantado en torno a la popular cerveza Singha.\n La joven multimillonaria, de 27 a\u00f1os, se ha dejado ver en las manifestaciones que desde hace m\u00e1s de dos meses recorren la capital tailandesa, ha colgado im\u00e1genes en las que se la ve cuidando de camaradas heridos y ha ofrecido discursos subida a improvisados escenarios desde los que ha llamado a sus compatriotas a tumbar el Gobierno de la primera ministra Yingluck Shinawatra.  \"Muchos tailandeses no entienden el verdadero sentido de la democracia, especialmente en las zonas rurales\", dec\u00eda en una de sus intervenciones m\u00e1s pol\u00e9micas, despreciando a las bases electorales del actual Gobierno.\n Heredera de una fortuna cercana a los 2.000 millones de euros, Chitpas Bhirombhakdi no es una excepci\u00f3n entre la \u00e9lite del pa\u00eds asi\u00e1tico.  Las grandes familias de Bangkok apoyan un movimiento que busca reforzar el papel de la ya influyente monarqu\u00eda, suspender la democracia temporalmente para refundar el Estado y expulsar del poder al clan de los Shinawatra, liderado por el ex primer ministro hoy en el exilio Thaksin Shinawatra, depuesto en un golpe militar en 2006.\n El activismo de Chitpas no ha sentado bien en su familia, parte de una \u00e9lite acostumbrada a manejar los resortes del poder desde la sombra y sin hacer ruido.  El padre de la joven emiti\u00f3 d\u00edas atr\u00e1s un comunicado en el que anunciaba su decisi\u00f3n de quitar a su hija el apellido familiar para que \"pueda continuar con sus actividades pol\u00edticas sin da\u00f1ar\" los negocios de la corporaci\u00f3n.  Todo indica que la medida llega tarde.\n Los distribuidores de cerveza Singha en las provincias del noreste del pa\u00eds, donde el apoyo al Gobierno sigue siendo mayoritario, han detectado un s\u00fabito descenso de las ventas, seg\u00fan una informaci\u00f3n del diario 'The New York Times'.\n Los esfuerzos de la familia por distanciarse de las actividades pol\u00edticas de su hija no impidieron que su casa fuera atacada con un artefacto explosivo poco despu\u00e9s de que se publicara la imagen en la que conduce un bulldozer durante los disturbios frente a la Casa del Gobierno.\n Las redes sociales se han llenado de comentarios a favor y en su contra, con los seguidores del Ejecutivo utilizando su ejemplo para reforzar la idea de que la revuelta que vive Tailandia est\u00e1 dirigida por las clases pudientes de Bangkok en un intento de preservar sus privilegios.  La arist\u00f3crata rebelde, entre tanto, asegura haber iniciado el viaje hacia su sue\u00f1o de la infancia: llegar a primera ministra.\n 'Muchos tailandeses no entienden el verdadero sentido de la democracia'\n1986: Nace en el seno de la familia propietaria del consorcio Boon Rawd Brewery, que produce la cerveza Singha.  2000: Inicia su formaci\u00f3n en el Reino Unido.  2005: Se une al Partido Dem\u00f3crata tailand\u00e9s y lanza dos campa\u00f1as fallidas para entrar en el Parlamento.  2013: Se convierte en una de las l\u00edderes de las protestas contra el Gobierno.",
