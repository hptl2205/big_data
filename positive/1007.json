In 1979, Pope John Paul II offered to mediate the conflict between Chile and Argentina over the Beagle Channel in the southern part of the South American continent.\n\n\"He may be even more prone to activism in regards to Cuba because this is a region of the world that means so much to him,\" Susan K. Purcell, the director of the Center for Hemispheric Policy at the University of Miami, told Fox News Latino. \"He may also be very concerned about the human rights question.\"\n\nBoth Obama and the administration highlighted the importance of the Pope's appeal to both the U.S. and Cuba in resolving not only the issue of Alan Gross and the Cuban Five, but in helping spur on the major thaw in relations announced by Obama Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"In particular I want to thank his holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be,\" Obama said during his speech on Wednesday, \"rather than simply settling for the world as it is.\"\n\nFollow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino\n\nBryan Llenas currently serves as a New York-based correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) and a reporter for Fox News Latino (FNL).

Both leaders acknowledged the importance of his appeal in their statements announcing the breakthrough.\n\nThe Vatican said the pope's letters called on the two countries \"to resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners, in order to initiate a new phase in relations\".\n\nThe Vatican also hosted delegations from the two countries at what were said to have been the talks at which the breakthrough was made. Kenneth Hackett, the US ambassador to the Holy See, said a senior Vatican official had \"played an important part in this historic moment by meeting US and Cuban delegations in October to help bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.\"\n\nThe re-establishment of normal relations between the two countries has been a cause dear to the hearts of successive popes, but the issue took on an even greater importance last year following the election last year of the first Latin American leader of the Catholic church.\n\nA senior US official told Reuters news agency: \"The support of Pope Francis and the support of the Vatican was important to us.\"\n\nPresident Obama discussed Cuba with the pope during his visit to the Vatican in March, and continued to work with the Holy See thereafter.\n\nSources in Rome and Washington said the archbishop of Havana, Cardinal Jaime Ortega, had played a key role in brokering a deal. He, too, was in Rome in October, and held a meeting with the pope on October 3, although it was not immediately clear whether he was the official referred to by Ambassador Hackett.\n\nThe US secretary of state, John Kerry, met with his Vatican counterpart on Monday. But the official version of the talks, issued by the Vatican, said that they had concentrated on efforts to close the American detention camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\n\nDiplomats in Rome were told that the issue of bilateral relations between Cuba had arisen, but that it was a minor part of Kerry's discussions with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state. Kerry visited Rome on a European tour that was mainly about reviving peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nThe pope is said by sources close to the Vatican to hold Cardinal Ortega in high regard. Francis has had two meetings this year with the Cuban prelate, the first being April 5.\n\nBut most intriguing is a special appointment he conferred on the archbishop last summer. According to both Obama and Castro, Canada hosted talks between envoys of their two countries, which led up to Wednesday's announcement. On 12 July, Ortega was named as the pope's special envoy to the celebrations of the 350th anniversary of the foundation of the first Roman Catholic parish in the Americas north of Mexico - that of Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec.",

The pope also worked to secure the freedom of Alan Gross, an American citizen who had been held in Cuba for nearly five years and was released on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe Vatican said Wednesday that Francis wrote letters both to Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro to encourage them to \"resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners.\"\n\n\"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the governments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of overcoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history,\" a statement from the Vatican said.\n\nIn addition to the Pope's written appeal to the leaders, the Vatican hosted and, according to a senior U.S. administration official, participated in meetings between the U.S. and Cuba in October. Canada hosted other meetings between the two countries, but did not participate.\n\nPopes have played a critical role in diplomacy between communist countries and the West since the end of the World War II, says Massimo Faggioli, a theology professor at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. He says Pope John XXIII advocated for the rights of both Catholics and non-Catholics in communist regimes in Eastern Europe.\n\nMassimo also notes Francis' experience in dealing with dictatorships, as the current pope \"secretly and quietly dealt with\" generals in the 1970s in his native Argentina in his role as the country's Jesuit provincial.\n\n[READ: Pope Francis Finds Favor Across the World]\n\n\"I think that that personal experience in the '70s has played a role in his decision of stepping in and trying to become involved [between the U.S. and Cuba],\" Massimo says.\n\nHe says the Vatican's involvement in Cuba actually began in 1962, when Pope John XXIII intervened between President John F. Kennedy and Secretary of the Russian Communist Party Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis. That pope excommunicated Fidel Castro in 1962 because the Cuban dictator targeted Catholic institutions in the country.\n\nJohn Paul II made the first papal visit to Cuba in 1998, restoring the celebration of Christmas as a public holiday in the country. Castro had eliminated the holiday in 1969. Pope Benedict visited Cuba in 2012, but Francis has not yet made a trip to the island.\n\nIn a press conference Wednesday Sens. Barbara Mikulski , D-Md., and Ben Cardin , D-Md., said that they, along with Rep. Chris van Hollen , D-Md., and Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill., raised the case of Gross' detention with a Vatican representative in the U.S. before Benedict's visit.\n\nChad Pecknold, associate professor of theology at the Catholic University of America, says Gross' case was likely raised with Francis as well when he became pope in 2013. He says Vatican diplomacy is usually handled by cardinals and bishops who intervene on behalf of the pope.\n\n\"What I see as unusual here is the very personal touch of Francis in the sense of enabling the diplomatic corps' work through his own personal intervention,\" Pecknold says. \"You can see now you have a pope who is hands on with Vatican diplomacy.\"\n\nMassimo says the fact that Francis is Latin American may have given him additional diplomatic channels into Cuba that may not have been available before. He says it's also likely the pope took an interest in the country because a large portion of the population is Catholic.\n\nBoth Obama and Castro credited Francis Wednesday for playing a crucial role in helping facilitate a renewal of ties.\n\n\"In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,\" Obama said in his statement announcing the release of Gross and new U.S. policies toward Cuba.",

Gross was released Dec. 17, hours before Obama announced that change in U.S. policy toward Cuba.\n\nThe administration official also said that a U.S. \"intelligence asset\" was being released after being held for 20 years in Cuba in exchange for three members of the Cuban Five, or Miami Five as they are also known, who have been imprisoned in the U.S. for about 14 years.\n\nThe official declined to identify the U.S. spy.\n\nThe men were members of a Cuban intelligence network in Miami known as \"La Red Avispa,\" or \"Wasp Network,\" dispatched by Cuba's then-President Fidel Castro in the early 1990s to infiltrate militant exile groups in South Florida, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe policy changes included the lifting of restrictions on travel to Cuba; review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism; allowing the sale of telecommunications equipment to Cuba; lifting of embargoes on Cuban products in the U.S.; and an easing of financial restrictions.\n\nThe administration official told reporters that with the changes, the U.S. would continue to pursue efforts to promote democracy and strengthen human rights in Cuba.\n\n\"Openness is a better policy than isolation in advancing the things we care about in Cuba,\" the official said.\n\nThe official laid out a timeline that indicated that talks between the U.S. and Cuba took about 18 months to evolve to the point where Obama announced a change in the American position regarding its Caribbean neighbor. The officials said talks mostly took place in Canada with one meeting occurring at the Vatican.\n\nObama said in a noontime address that the U.S. and Cuba would begin talks to normalize relations and open an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than 50 years. Diplomatic relations between the two countries ended in 1961.\n\nThe Vatican's role in the process is linked to Obama's visit to the Vatican in March. In a meeting with the pope, the administration official said, Cuba was \"a topic of discussion that got as much attention as anything they discussed.\"\n\n\"President Obama has enormous respect for Pope Francis and his personal engagement is important to us,\" the official added.\n\nSenior Vatican officials later received U.S. and Cuban officials together in October. The meeting gave representatives of both countries the opportunity to review details of their negotiations and formalize the exchange and transfer of the prisoners.\n\nThe administration official stressed that Gross' release was a humanitarian gesture by the Cuban government and was not tied to the prisoner exchange.\n\nThe official said the Vatican was the only government directly involved in talks between the two countries. Canada hosted meetings between the two governments during, but Canadian officials did not participate.\n\nThe Cuban Five were arrested Sept. 12, 1998 by a heavily armed FBI SWAT team. They were convicted in 2001 in Miami on charges including conspiracy to commit murder, acting as an agent of a foreign government, and other illegal activities in the United States and failure to register as foreign agents in the U.S. and other illegal activities. Each was sentenced to four life terms plus 75 years in December 2001.\n\nThey are hailed as national heroes in Cuba, according to AP.\n\nThe five appealed their convictions. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned their convictions in 2005, but the full court later reversed the ruling, ending the five men's bid for a new trial and reinstated the original convictions. In June 2009 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case.\n\nTwo were eventually released, one in October 2011 and the other in February of this year.",

                    "body": "ROME -- Pope Francis had quite a 78th birthday. The pontiff began Wednesday with prayers and a birthday celebration with tango dancers near St. Peter's Square. His day ended with a historic diplomatic breakthrough between Cuba and the United States -- and the disclosure that the Argentine pope played a key role as broker.\n\nFrancis is being credited for helping bridge the divide by first sending letters to President Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, and then having the Vatican host a diplomatic meeting between the two sides in October.\n\n\"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision,\" Francis said in a statement issued Wednesday night by the Vatican.\n\nVatican spokesmen declined to provide any details about Francis's letters, other than that he encouraged the two sides to resolve \"humanitarian questions\"; resolve the release of political prisoners, including an American held by Cuba, Alan P. Gross; and \"initiate a new phase in relations.\"\n\nThe Vatican's most senior official after the pope, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state, moderated the October meeting after the two countries sought out the Vatican as a trusted broker near the conclusion of their negotiations.\n\nFor Francis, the breakthrough on Wednesday burnished his efforts to reposition the Vatican as a broker in global diplomacy. He has already waded into Middle East protests, hosting a prayer summit meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian presidents that bore few tangible results. Soon afterward, Israel began its military assault against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in Gaza.\n\nBut Francis has quickly become one of the world's leading figures, and his role in the United States-Cuba breakthrough undoubtedly is tied to his status as the first Latin American pope of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\"He knows the Cuban situation by heart,\" said Gianni La Bella, a professor of contemporary history and an expert in Latin American Catholicism, as well as a member of the Community of Sant'Egidio, a liberal Catholic group active in international affairs. \"He visited when he was a cardinal and has a strong relationship with the archbishop of Havana, who is obviously a strategic player in this.\"\n\nIn April, the Vatican and Cuba celebrated 79 years of diplomatic relations as they jointly staged a photography exhibition at a church in Rome. Although the Vatican has had problems with Havana, it steadfastly opposes the American embargo and has kept diplomatic lines open.\n\nFidel Castro visited the Vatican in 1996 and met with Pope John Paul II. Two years later, John Paul visited Cuba, where he criticized the embargo as causing hardship for ordinary people and called for it to be rescinded. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba, in 2012.\n\n\"I was in Cuba for almost two years, and I understand what this news means to the island,\" said Msgr. Angelo Becciu, once the Vatican's ambassador to Cuba. \"It opens new scenarios and gives great hope to all Cuban people. The cease of the embargo will encourage and revitalize the island's perspectives, as well as its economy.\"\n\nAfter he became pope in 2013, Francis was expected to revitalize the church in the Southern Hemisphere. But his background has also helped the Vatican reposition itself as an independent actor in diplomacy, less tethered to European or American worldviews than in the past.\n\nFrancis's appointment of Cardinal Parolin as secretary of state was also significant. Long considered one of the Vatican's most talented diplomats, Cardinal Parolin served as apostolic nuncio in Venezuela, one of Cuba's closest allies. From that perch, Cardinal Parolin gained a sophisticated understanding of regional dynamics and the Cuban predicament, Professor La Bella said.\n\n\"The Vatican's knowledge of the Latin American situation is at a very high level, and very direct,\" he said.\n\nMonsignor Becciu, currently a member of the State Secretariat in the Vatican, added that Wednesday's announcement, on Francis's birthday, was certainly a \"beautiful present for the Holy Father.\"",

                    "body": "ROME -- Pope Francis had quite a 78th birthday. The pontiff began Wednesday with prayers and a birthday celebration with tango dancers near St. Peter's Square. His day ended with a historic diplomatic breakthrough between Cuba and the United States -- and the disclosure that the Argentine pope played a key role as broker.\n\nFrancis is being credited for helping bridge the divide by first sending letters to President Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba, and then having the Vatican host a diplomatic meeting between the two sides in October.\n\n\"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision,\" Francis said in a statement released Wednesday night by the Vatican.\n\nVatican spokesmen declined to provide any details about Francis's letters, other than that he encouraged the two sides to resolve \"humanitarian questions\"; resolve the release of political prisoners, including an American held by Cuba, Alan P. Gross; and \"initiate a new phase in relations.\"\n\nThe Vatican's second-in-command, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the secretary of state, moderated the October meeting after the two countries sought out the Vatican as a trusted broker near the conclusion of their negotiations.\n\nFor Francis, the breakthrough on Wednesday burnished his efforts to reposition the Vatican as a broker in global diplomacy. He has already waded into Middle East protests, hosting a prayer summit meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian presidents that bore few tangible results. Soon afterward, Israel began its military assault against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in Gaza.\n\nBut Francis has quickly become one of the world's leading figures, and his role in the United States-Cuba breakthrough undoubtedly is tied to his status as the first Latin American pope of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\"He knows the Cuban situation by heart,\" said Gianni La Bella, a professor of contemporary history and an expert in Latin American Catholicism, as well as a member of the Community of Sant'Egidio, a liberal Catholic group active in international affairs. \"He visited when he was a cardinal and has a strong relationship with the archbishop of Havana, who is obviously a strategic player in this.\"\n\nIn April, the Vatican and Cuba celebrated 79 years of diplomatic relations as they jointly staged a photography exhibition at a church in Rome. Although the Vatican has had problems with Havana, it steadfastly opposes the American embargo and has kept diplomatic lines open.\n\nFidel Castro visited the Vatican in 1996 and met with Pope John Paul II. Two years later, John Paul visited Cuba, where he criticized the embargo as causing hardship for ordinary people and called for it to be rescinded. His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, also visited Cuba, in 2012.\n\n\"I was in Cuba for almost two years, and I understand what this news means to the island,\" said Msgr. Angelo Becciu, once the Vatican's apostolic nuncio, or ambassador, to Cuba. \"It opens new scenarios and gives great hope to all Cuban people. The cease of the embargo will encourage and revitalize the island's perspectives, as well as its economy.\"\n\nAfter he became pope in 2013, Francis was expected to revitalize the church in the Southern Hemisphere. But his background has also helped the Vatican reposition itself as an independent actor in diplomacy, less tethered to European or American worldviews than in the past.\n\nFrancis's appointment of Cardinal Parolin as secretary of state was also significant. Long considered one of the Vatican's most talented diplomats, Cardinal Parolin served as apostolic nuncio in Venezuela, one of Cuba's closest allies. From that perch, Cardinal Parolin gained a sophisticated understanding of regional dynamics and the Cuban predicament, Professor La Bella said.\n\n\"The Vatican's knowledge of the Latin American situation is at a very high level, and very direct,\" he said.\n\nMonsignor Becciu, currently a member of the State Secretariat in the Vatican, added that Wednesday's announcement, on Francis's birthday, was certainly a \"beautiful present for the Holy Father.\"",

                    "body": "It's common for the Vatican to play middleman in some of the most heated global disputes. It did so in a Chile-Argentina border standoff in the 1970s, and between Britain and Iran in 2007 over hostages. But such papal diplomacy has taken place behind the scenes.\n\nPope Francis's public role in the surprise thawing Wednesday of relations between Cuba and the United States was a game changer, one that Vatican watchers say suggests his desire for a more open, muscular role in world affairs.\n\nThe Catholic Church has long been a key mediator between the United States and the largely isolated, traditionally Catholic island of Cuba, gaining credibility by criticizing both sides and calling for dialogue. But it took a confluence of factors for decades of negotiating to pay off. They include Cuba's recent loosening of religious restrictions, a pope who has focused on that country since writing a book about it years ago and the influence of a Cuban cardinal who had recently become more focused on ending the embargo.\n\n\"This pope is willing to lean further forward than anyone else has,\" said Francis Rooney, U.S. ambassador to the Vatican in the mid-2000s and author of \"The Global Vatican,\" which came out last fall. \"I think we'll see the Holy See be more out front, whether for good or bad. .\u2009.\u2009. He has a strong interest in propelling the Holy See's diplomacy.\"\n\nThe Vatican often intercedes out of public view in part to tamp down controversy about its policy of dialogue with any and all parties. On Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is Catholic, criticized the pope for his role in forging the U.S.-Cuba agreement, reportedly saying he'd like \"his Holiness to take up the cause of freedom.\"\n\nSpokesmen for the Vatican declined to return calls seeking comment, but its press office Wednesday put out an unusual -- if brief -- statement acknowledging the pope's advocacy and the fact that Rome had hosted conversations in October.\n\n\"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the Governments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of overcoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history,\" the statement read.\n\nPresident Obama and multiple U.S. lawmakers Wednesday noted the Vatican's involvement in 18 months of U.S.-Cuba talks, in particular over the five-year detention of Maryland contractor Alan Gross, who was released Wednesday in a prisoner exchange. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said the Vatican \"has been deeply involved in this whole negotiation with the prisoners and played a key role.\"\n\nMiguel Diaz, who served as U.S. ambassador to the Vatican from 2009 to 2012, said Pope Benedict spoke to officials during a 2012 Cuban visit about relations with the United States, including Gross's detention.\n\nHe noted that Benedict and then Francis elevated two key diplomats who are Latin America experts. Giovanni Angelo Becciu was the Vatican's representative in Cuba until 2011, when Benedict brought him to the Vatican to serve as a high-ranking member of its equivalent of the State Department. Francis named Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who had been ambassador to Venezuela since 2009, as his secretary of state.\n\n\"You have two very astute and experienced diplomats [on the topic of Latin America] who are now part of the most intimate circles at the secretary of state,\" Diaz said.\n\nRooney noted that Benedict had visited Cuba and called for dialogue, but \"would never have taken this bold a step.\" Benedict was criticized by some human rights activists for not meeting with dissidents.\n\nThen came Pope Francis, who like other Latin Americans was hugely impacted by the Cuban revolution, said Austen Ivereigh, author of the new Francis biography \"The Great Reformer.\"\n\nFrancis \"saw the paralysis that resulted from the embargo, which had a deeply damaging impact on Cuban politics, psyche and economics,\" Ivereigh said.\n\nIn 1998, Francis, then an assistant archbishop in Buenos Aires, was asked to visit Cuba with Pope John Paul II as part of the Latin American delegation. Later he produced a book about the trip called \"Dialogues Between John Paul II and Fidel Castro.\"\n\nIn the book, Ivereigh says, the pope-to-be mentions the embargo and is strongly critical of both \"the anthropolitical error of socialism\" as well as \"the spirit that has driven capitalism -- using capital to oppress and subject people.\"\n\nAs of the 1990s, Francis \"had in mind as a cardinal the issue of Cuba,\" said Mario Paredes, a longtime top adviser to the U.S. bishops on Hispanic issues.\n\nThe Catholic Church plays a complicated role in Cuba. Sixty percent of the island's population identifies as Catholic, but the government has repressed institutional religion. It restricts the staff the Catholic Church can send to the island, bans organizing and imposes its own leadership.\n\nThe coming to power in the last few years of Ra\u00fal Castro -- Fidel's brother -- has opened the government's stance toward the church, said Parades. In the past five years, Castro has \"returned to the church\" more than 100 institutions, he said.\n\nParedes also described the close relationship between Francis and the archbishop of Havana, Cardinal Jaime Ortega. Ortega, nearing the end of his tenure, became more focused on finding \"a new beginning\" for Cuba. But the Gross case was a roadblock.\n\nOrtega met twice at the Vatican Embassy in Washington with Gross's wife, Paredes said. And Ortega lobbied on the case with Castro, Paredes said.\n\nThese church figures had also finally found a partner in the White House, Rooney noted.\n\nNow that these years of behind-the-scenes talks have been revealed, what will Francis and his diplomats tackle next? How will the world react to Francis the foreign policy player?\n\nJohn Paul II was extremely public in his fight against communism, as was Benedict about radical Islam when he gave a 2006 lecture that spurred deadly protests.\n\nIvereigh said that Francis is a \"master builder of bridges\" and that the U.S.-Cuba talks could be a model.\n\n\"I think Francis sees himself as trying to create space for peace and agreement where at the moment there isn't. He sees this as fundamental to his papacy,\" he said.",

In the most significant change in our policy in more than 50 years we will end an outdated approach which for decades has failed to advance our interests and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,\" said Obama in a televised address to the nation.\n\nBefore getting into the specifics of the policy changes, however, Obama took time to praise Pope Francis for his role in the safe return of Gross to the U.S., which he said had been a \"major obstacle\" in the normalizing of U.S.-Cuba relations. Gross is a sub-contractor for USAID.\n\n\"Over many months, my administration has held discussions with the Cuban government about Alan's case and other aspects of our relationship. His Holiness Pope Francis issued a personal appeal to me and to Cuba's President, Raul Castro, urging us to resolve Alan's case. And to address Cuba's interest in the release of three Cuban agents who've been jailed in the United States for over 15 years,\" said Obama.\n\n\"Today, Alan returned home, reunited with his family at long last. Alan was released by the Cuban government on humanitarian grounds,\" Obama noted. \"... I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be rather than simply settling for the world as it is.\"\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Vatican said the Pope was happy about the historic warming of relations between the U.S. and Cuba and explained that delegations from both countries were hosted by the Vatican last October.\n\n\"The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the Governments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of overcoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history,\" said the statement.\n\n\"The Holy See received Delegations of the two countries in the Vatican last October and provided its good offices to facilitate a constructive dialogue on delicate matters, resulting in solutions acceptable to both Parties,\" it noted while adding that the Holy See will continue to support efforts to normalize relations between the two countries.\n\nIn addition to Gross's release, President Obama explained that a very important American intelligence agent who had been imprisoned in Cuba for more than two decades was also released by Cuba and he has since returned home as well. In return, the U.S. also released three Cuban agents who had been imprisoned.\n\nWhile President Obama's executive actions ease sanctions affecting trade and travel to Cuba, they do not change the 1996 Helms-Burton Act and other laws passed by Congress restricting most travel and trade with the island nation.\n\nAmong the main components covered by the new U.S.-Cuba policy changes are:\n\n* Re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba which were severed in January 1961\n\n* Adjusting regulations to more effectively empower the Cuban people\n\n* Facilitating an expansion of travel under general licenses for the 12 existing categories of travel to Cuba authorized by law\n\n* Facilitating remittances to Cuba by U.S. persons\n\n* Authorizing expanded commercial sales/exports from the United States of certain goods and services\n\n* Authorizing American citizens to import additional goods from Cuba-\n\n* Facilitating authorized transactions between the United States and Cuba\n\n* Initiating new efforts to increase Cubans' access to communications and their ability to communicate freely\n\n* Updating the application of Cuba sanctions in third countries\n\n* Pursuing discussions with the Cuban and Mexican governments to discuss our unresolved maritime boundary in the Gulf of Mexico\n\n* Initiating a review of Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism\n\n* Addressing Cuba's participation in the 2015 Summit of the Americas in Panama\n\nEach point is addressed in more detail in this White House fact sheet.\n\n\"Through these changes, we intend to create more opportunities for the American and Cuban people and begin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas,\" said Obama.",

He thanked President Obama for working to ensure his freedom, and said he is looking forward to celebrating \"the best Hanukkah.\" (AP)\n\nThe Vatican was intimately involved in talks that resulted in the release Wednesday of American contractor Alan Gross and news that the United States and Cuba would begin working to normalize relations, with Pope Francis making a \"personal plea\" in a letter to President Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro.\n\nTalks between the two countries began last year, with Canada providing a place for representatives to meet. The Vatican also hosted talks -- but in this case representatives from the Vatican attended, said senior U.S. administration officials during a news conference Wednesday.\n\nGross was released from Cuba in exchange for the United States releasing three Cubans jailed for espionage, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Vatican's specific role wasn't immediately clear, although one of the U.S. officials said that when the pope met with Obama earlier this year, the topic of Cuba received \"as much attention as anything else they discussed.\"\n\nThe president later Wednesday said he and Castro each received a letter with a \"personal plea\" from Francis to resolve the issues around the prisoners.\n\nTheologian Miguel Diaz, who served as U.S. ambassador to the Vatican from 2009 to 2012, said the Vatican has been involved in talks from the start -- along with many other parties -- under Pope Benedict XVI and now under Francis.\n\n\"The voices that have been added to the choir asking for justice have been quite extensive. I don't think at this point we need to focus on just one entity. There have been religious voices, there have been politicians, world leaders, humanitarian agencies, among others,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Diaz noted that the Latin American diplomatic firepower has increased significantly in recent years.\n\nIn addition to the Argentine pope, who took office in March 2013, Giovanni Angelo Becciu was brought from Cuba to Rome in 2011 to be a high-ranking member of the Vatican's equivalent of the State Department. Becciu -- who is Italian -- was the Vatican's representative in Cuba for two years before becoming the substitute for general affairs.\n\nFrancis also named Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who had been ambassador to Venezuela since 2009, as his secretary of state.\n\n\"You have two very astute and experienced diplomats [on the topic of Latin America] who are now part of the most intimate circles at the secretary of state,\" Diaz said. \"And of course now you have a pope from Latin America. When it comes to Latin American diplomacy nowadays, at the Vatican you have some very, very well-situated and experienced persons who know the realities.\"\n\nCarol Morello and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.",

But in the meantime, let's note the amazing fact that Pope Francis directly brokered a diplomatic deal between the United States and Cuba.\n\nFrom Evan McMorris-Santoro:\n\nWASHINGTON -- Pope Francis was instrumental in facilitating the normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, a senior White House official said Wednesday.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to announce a deal with the Caribbean nation Wednesday afternoon that will pave the way for the first U.S. embassy on Cuban soil since the Kennedy administration and a relaxing of many of the American economic and travel restrictions on Cuba that have defined the relationship between the two nations for decades.\n\nFrancis played a big role in bringing the longtime rivals to the negotiating table, the official said. Francis sent what was characterized as an extraordinary personal letter to Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro over the summer, urging both parties to end their frosty relationship. Following the letter, and the negotiations, Obama and Castro had a phone conversation that helped lead to Wednesday's announcement.\n\nThe letter \"gave us greater impetus and momentum for us to move forward,\" the administration official said. The Vatican was the only government that participated in the negotiations between the U.S. and Cuba. Vatican officials were \"in those meetings,\" the official said.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the parameters of the deal are. But what we know now is that the only other government involved was the Vatican, and that the Pope's personal letters catalyzed the process.\n\nIt resulted in the release of an American prisoner, Alan Gross, something intimated months ago by Tim Padgett, a journalist specializing in Latin America. But the release on the first day of Hanukkah is almost too good to be true.\n\nWith such promising developments in diplomacy, it no longer seems implausible that the Vatican will play a key role in facilitating the closing of Guantanamo. Secretary of State Kerry addressed just this issue in talks with the Vatican earlier this week.",

After initial contacts pointed toward a resolution, a November meeting of both sides at the Vatican clinched the agreement that saw Gross returned to the US this morning (along with a jailed US intelligence operative) and the Cubans likewise freed to the island.\n\nIn a rare evening statement, the Vatican Secretariat of State said that Francis \"wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the Governments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of overcoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history.\" The Holy See promised to continue \"its support for initiatives which both nations will undertake to strengthen their bilateral relations and promote the wellbeing of their respective citizens.\"\n\nIn sum, as Papa Bergoglio's June Holy Land peace summit scored global headlines yet failed to attain short-term progress, today's development after a half-century standoff represents the signal diplomatic triumph of Francis' 21-month pontificate. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, even if the initial push came from the Pope, the breakthrough represents a no less sizable victory for Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Secretary of State who Francis chose for the role with a mandate to restore the Vatican's traditional cred as a geopolitical powerhouse in its ability to mediate international disputes.\n\nIn this case, the experience of Rome's key players provided an even more critical advantage: in his prior assignment as Nuncio to Venezuela, Parolin had a rare insight into Cuba as the Vatican's mission-chief to what's become Havana's most significant ally, while his top deputy, the Sostituto Archbishop Angelo Becciu, had been Nuncio to the island itself for two years before returning to Rome as the Curia's \"chief of staff\" in 2011.\n\nOn another key front, the Vatican's role in securing the deal has likely been the reason for the holdup on Francis' intensely-awaited appointment of the next archbishop of Havana, which ops in Rome and Latin America have expected to take place sometime this fall following August's celebrations for the 50th priestly anniversary of Cardinal Jaime Ortega y Alamino, who at 78 is three years past the canonical retirement age.\n\nWhile the Cuban church has been granted an enhanced space with which to work over Ortega's two-decade tenure at the helm - a reality that two papal visits (in 1998 and 2012) did much to help along - the new inroads have come at the expense of criticism and suspicion of the cardinal by the influential exile community, which has assailed Ortega as an accommodationist to the Castro regime.\n\nDEVELOPING - MORE TO COME.\n\n-30-",

The Vatican said the letters called on the two countries \"to resolve humanitarian questions of common interest, including the situation of certain prisoners, in order to initiate a new phase in relations\".\n\nThe Vatican also hosted delegations from the two countries at what were said to have been the talks at which the breakthrough was made. Kenneth Hackett, the US ambassador to the Holy See, said a senior Vatican official had \"played an important part in this historic moment by meeting with US and Cuban delegations in October to help bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion\".\n\nThe re-establishment of normal relations between the two countries has been a cause dear to the hearts of successive popes, but the issue took on greater importance after the election last year of the first Latin American leader of the Catholic church.\n\nPresident Obama discussed Cuba with the pope during his visit to the Vatican in March and continued to work with the Holy See thereafter.\n\nSources in Rome and Washington said that the archbishop of Havana, Cardinal Jaime Ortega, had played a key role in brokering a deal. He too was in Rome in October and held a meeting with the pope on October 3. But it was not clear whether he was the official referred to by Hackett.\n\nJohn Kerry, the US Secretary of State, met with his Vatican counterpart on Monday. But the official version of the talks, issued by the Vatican, said they had concentrated on efforts to close the US detention camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba.\n\nDiplomats in Rome were told that the issue of bilateral relations between Cuba had arisen, but that it was a minor part of Kerry's discussions with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state. Kerry came to Rome on a European tour that was mainly about reviving peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian authority.\n\nThe pope is said by sources close to the Vatican to hold Ortega in high regard. Francis has had two meetings this year with the Cuban cardinal, the first being on 5 April.\n\nBut most intriguing is a special appointment he conferred on the archbishop last summer. According to both Obama and Castro, Canada hosted talks between envoys of their two countries which led up to Wednesday's announcement. On 12 July, Ortega was named as the pope's special envoy to the celebrations of the 350th anniversary of the foundation of the first Roman Catholic parish in the Americas north of Mexico - that of Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nThe news of his mission was slipped out by the Vatican's press office on a Saturday - the last in a list of appointments, below that of a new officer for the court of first instance for cases of matrimonial nullity in the Italian region of Lazio. The cardinal-archbishop thus had a perfect excuse for travelling to and from Canada during a crucial phase in the negotiations.\n\nOrtega in any case has a special link to Canada - he studied in Quebec City with the Quebec Foreign Missionary Society. He celebrated a special, pontifical high mass at Notre Dame on 14 September and addressed the Canadian bishops' annual conference two days later.",

But friendly ties advanced rapidly beginning in the early 1990s, when then-President Fidel Castro relaxed rules on religion by changing the country from being officially atheist to secular, and loosened restrictions on churches after a 1996 Vatican visit with John Paul II. In 1998, the then-pope made a five-day pilgrimage to Cuba, blessing a stone that would stand at the entrance to the first new seminary to be built since the Cuban revolution. The seminary opened in 2010, five years after John Paul II's death.\n\n\"I think John Paul II is very happy right now,\" said Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami, a prominent American church leader who pastors to the largest Cuban-American community and last visited Cuba in 2012 for Pope Benedict XVI's pilgrimage to the island. \"When (John Paul II) went to Cuba, it made it okay for Catholics to go to church and be Catholic.\" Not long after the pope's visit, for example, Fidel Castro restored Christmas as a national holiday.\n\nWenski said the role of the Catholic Church, by far Cuba's largest and most influential religious institution, has quickly grown in the intervening years, especially since Raul Castro came to power in 2008. Of the country's 11 million residents, about 59 percent are Christian and most of those are Catholic, yet the country's aging, dilapidated pre-revolution churches suffer from a shortage of priests, nuns and seminarians. Many Cubans practice their faith at home or through devotion to Our Lady of Charity, the island's patron saint. Practices such as Santeria, which incorporate Catholic and West African spiritual practices, are popular alongside formal Catholic worship.\n\nIn October, Cuban officials announced that Sandino, a small agricultural town in the western Pinar del Rio province, will be home to the first church built in 55 years. Catholics from Tampa, Florida, are funding the construction. The seminary that opened four years ago was desperately needed, Wenski said, for a country with less than 200 priests. It's estimated that 10 percent of Cubans attend church services.\n\n\"With the news today, would Cuba allow the Vatican to send in more priests and nuns?\" said Andy Gomez, a former senior adviser to the University of Miami's Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies. \"That would be very, very interesting,\" said Gomez, a Cuban-American who is currently a senior adviser at Poblete Tamargo, a Washington-based public policy firm.\n\nGomez, who traveled to Cuba in 2012 for Pope Benedict XVI's three-day visit to Havana, credited the Havana archbishop, Cardinal Jaime Ortega, for much of the improved situation for Cuban Catholics. Per Vatican policy, the archbishop submitted his resignation letter when he turned 75 in 2011, but the pope asked him to stay in office. \"Pope Francis had made the same request, in part because of how effective he is in working with (Raul) Castro,\" said Gomez.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, Ortega negotiated the release of more than 150 political prisoners, but he was accused of capitulating to government demands when the prisoners were exiled to Spain instead of being allowed to return home. Cuban-Americans have also criticized the cardinal, saying he has not forcefully stood up to the Cuban government's abuses of power.\n\nGomez chalks up some of that, at least, to the guarded political posturing required of anyone who wants to have an ear among the regime's leaders. At least one high-ranking church official, Apostolic Nuncio Bruno Musaro, a Vatican ambassador to the country, has called out government abuses, saying over the summer during a vacation in Italy that the Cuban people are \"victims of a socialist dictatorship.\"\n\nThe Vatican press office, though, has kept its recent messaging positive. The church \"will continue to assure its support for initiatives which both nations will undertake to strengthen their bilateral relations and promote the wellbeing of their respective citizens,\" it said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe Rev. Manual Dorantes, a Chicago-based Vatican spokesman who is tasked with Spanish-language and Latin American church issues, said he looked at thawed U.S.-Cuba relations as a sign of the \"way the church can serve as a bridge.\"\n\n\"Historically, the Vatican has played this role. It was present between the (USSR) and the United States under Pope John XXIII. It was there with John Paul II and communism in Eastern Europe,\" said Dorantes, who also visited Cuba during the 2012 papal pilgrimage.\n\n\"Christ called the church to be present in society. That's exactly what the Holy Father is doing. He tried it with Israel and Palestine, now he's doing it with Obama and Castro.\"\n\nWith the pope scheduled to visit the United States in September and committed to visiting three unspecified Latin American countries in 2015, some have speculated he will make a stop in Cuba. Dorantes said he didn't know. The pope, then known as Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio, last visited the island for Pope John Paul II's pilgrimage in 1998.\n\n\"It would make three popes who went to Cuba if he did,\" said Wenski. \"But it's too early to tell.\"",

The two countries have agreed to exchange prisoners, relax embargo laws, and re-open diplomatic relations after a half century of fossilized opposition. During his speech announcing the radical shift in relations on December 17, President Obama explained what led to today's breakthrough:\n\nHis Holiness Pope Francis issued a personal appeal to me and to Cuba's president, Ra\u00fal Castro, urging us to resolve [the case of Alan Gross] and to address Cuba's interests in the release of three Cuban agents, who've been jailed in the United States for over 15 years.\n\nIt turns out that Pope Francis intervened personally with President Obama during the President's visit to the Vatican this past March, and then followed-up with private letters to Presidents Obama and Castro, calling on them personally to take action. Intensive work at the Vatican this Fall, with the cooperation of Canadian diplomats, worked out the fine details of the agreement that became official on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the Holy See has diplomatic relations with around 180 sovereign states and is party to numerous other international agreements, it is not always the case that the Pope and the Holy See receive a global spotlight for the behind-the-scenes work they do daily across the world.\n\nThis is not the first time Pope Francis has attempted to intervene on such an important issue of international relations. Last year he wrote a personal letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and this Spring he hosted a meeting of Shimon Peres and Mahmoud Abbas in the Vatican. The scale of Pope Francis' success in the present US-Cuba agreement, however, is greater than any of his previous international diplomatic interventions.\n\nBut an intervention on that level by the Pope is itself not unprecedented.\n\nJohn Paul II with Argentine and Chilean negotiators of the Beagle Conflict in 1979\n\nIt's late December, 1978, and Chile and Argentina are on the brink of war. Their dispute is over three small islands at the southern tip of South America - islands that would be unremarkable if it were not for their strategic location where the Atlantic and Pacific oceans meet in the Beagle Channel. Both countries make impassioned cases for their claims before the world community. Yet, time after time, the talks between the two countries break down. The situation deteriorates so far that the military junta of Argentina draws up an invasion plan and orders its execution just days before Christmas 1978. Argentine troops are about to cross the border into Chile when, out of the blue, the Argentine junta calls off the operation completely. Within days, Chile and Argentina are at the table, agreeing on the first step in solving the conflict: bring in the Vatican.\n\nWhat happened? John Paul II, Pope for just over two months, had personally intervened and prevailed upon the Argentine junta to allow the Holy See to broker the accord between the two nations, which at last they signed in 1984. Archbishop Ubaldo Calabresi, Papal Nuncio to Argentina at the time, was instrumental in these negotiations.\n\nFast forward to today: December 17, 2014. That the first Pope from Latin America has brokered the historic agreement between Cuba and America has been noticed by the Press. USA Today, Time, The Guardian and others have acknowledged the pivotal role the Holy See, and the Pope personally, played in working out this agreement, pointing out the Latin American connection.\n\nBut in the Latin American world, Cuba and Argentina represent opposite ends of the geographical, cultural, linguistic, and political spectrum. Far closer to home for Pope Francis would have been the powerful witness of Pope John Paul II in his successful intervention between Bergoglio's native Argentina and its neighbor Chile in the Beagle Conflict.\n\nAt the end of today's speech, President Obama again acknowledged the role of Francis in the present agreement: \"In particular I want to thank his holiness Pope Francis, for [trying to make the world] as it should be, rather than as it is.\"\n\nTo that, history should also add acknowledgement of John Paul II for setting the precedent, and Archbishop Calabresi -- a key negotiator in the Argentine/Chilean agreement -- who oversaw Bergoglio's ascendancy to the episcopate in 1992. (The two bishops are pictured, left.)\n\nWhile Bergoglio was initially reticent to accept the call from Pope John Paul II to become a bishop -- on the grounds that being a bishop would conflict with his vows as a Jesuit -- John Paul II, through Calabresi, addressed Bergoglio's concerns, and at last prevailed upon him to accept the call. Had that negotiation failed, only history would know if Wednesday's historic agreement -- overseen by the Pope from Argentina -- would have ever come about.",

It was him who took the initiative and sent letters urging Presidents Barack Obama and Ra\u00fal Castro to resolve \"humanitarian questions\"; resolve the release of political prisoners, including Alan Gross, and \"initiate a new phase in relations\" and later had the Vatican host a diplomatic meeting between the two sides in October, which was moderated by Papal Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, providing what the Vatican calls \"its good offices to facilitate a constructive dialogue\".\n\nThe Holy See has vowed to continue to offer support for initiatives on the part of both countries to strengthen bilateral relations and promote the wellbeing of their respective citizens.\n\n\"[The Pope] knows the Cuban situation by heart,\" Gianni La Bella, a professor of contemporary history and an expert in Latin American Catholicism, as well as a member of the Community of Sant'Egidio, a liberal Catholic group active in international affairs told The New York Times. \"He visited when he was a cardinal and has a strong relationship with the archbishop of Havana, who is obviously a strategic player in this,\" the scholar added.\n\nFrancis's appointment of Cardinal Parolin as secretary of state was also significant. Long considered one of the Vatican's most talented diplomats, Cardinal Parolin served as apostolic nuncio in Venezuela, one of Cuba's closest allies. From that perch, Cardinal Parolin gained a sophisticated understanding of regional dynamics and the Cuban predicament, Professor La Bella said.\n\nBorn Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, exactly 78 years ago on Wednesday, he became the first Latin American Head of the Catholic church on March 13, 2013. He was given a tango dance birthday party at St Peter's Square, celebrated the 2-1 victory in extra time of his favourite football club San Lorenzo de Almagro (ironically not named after a true saint) over Auckland City of New Zealand at a Club World Cup semi-final in Marrakesh and reinforced his role as a key broker in international affairs, all in one day.",

He spoke for less than 10 minutes and closed by saying he will have more to say about those matters later. Mr. Castro referred to the release of Alan Gross as being on humanitarian grounds, but also mentioned the release of a spy who had been imprisoned in Cuba.\n\nIn his remarks about the diplomatic breakthrough with the United States, Mr. Castro also praised Pope Francis, who hosted a meeting at the Vatican at the end of 18 months of secret talks.\n\nHere are some of the translated highlights of Mr. Castro's statement:\n\nWe carry forward, given the difficulties, with the actualization of our economic model to build a prosperous and sustainable socialism. There resulted a high-level dialogue, including a telephone conversation I had yesterday with President Barack Obama. We have been able to advance the solutions of some themes of interest to both nations....\n\nThis decision of President Obama deserves the respect and acknowledgement of our people. I want to recognize the support of the Vatican, especially Pope Francis, to the betterment of the relations between Cuba and the U.S. Equally, to the Canadian government for helping realize the high-level dialogue between the two countries....\n\nThis does not mean the principal issue has been resolved: the blockade which causes much human and economic damage to our country should cease. Although the blockade has become law, the President of the U.S. can modify it through executive action....\n\nWe propose to the U.S. government to adopt mutual measures to improve the bilateral climate and advance the normalization of links between our countries, based on the principles of international rights and the United Nations. Cuba reiterates it disposition to participate in organizations like the U.N.\n\nRecognizing we have profound differences -- fundamentally in the themes of national sovereignty, human rights and foreign policy -- we reiterate our disposition to dialogue on all these themes. I exhort the United States government to remove the obstacles that impede or restrict the links between our peoples, the families and the citizens of both countries. In particular, relative to travel, direct postal service and telecommunications....\n\nThe progress attained in the interchange show it is possible to find solutions to many problems....\n\nAs we have repeated we should learn the art of coexistence in a civil manner with our differences.",

We believe a policy of engagement will be more effective.\"\n\n\"It is clear that decades of US isolation of Cuba have failed to accomplish our enduring objective of promoting the emergence of a democratic, prosperous, and stable Cuba,\" added the press secretary, Josh Earnest, in a written statement.\n\nThe talks, which first began in Canada last June and continued this autumn at the Vatican, also included the release of three Cuban spies held in the US and one American spy who has been held in Cuba for nearly 20 years. The US claimed Cuba had already agreed to release 53 political prisoners it has held, but insisted the release of Gross was separate and on \"humanitarian grounds\", reflecting its continued insistence that he was not engaged in espionage work.",

The Canadian capital was seen as an ideal meeting place because of the country's close ties to both Cuba and the US, although the Canadians didn't take part in the talks. Pope Francis -- the first-ever pontiff from Latin America -- also played a key role. He pushed both sides to talk to each other and reportedly hosted the final negotiation session at the Vatican.

It is an example that has been honoured by the Former Prime Minister PJ Patterson ON and our current Party President, Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller ON.\"\n\nThe PNP said that it viewed as a \"quantum leap\" the announcement by the US President specifically: the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations between both countries; the establishment of respective embassies in the capitals of both countries; and the relaxation of travel requirements and restrictions among and between nationals of both countries.\n\n\"We also see it as an absolution and vindication of the decisions we have taken over these many years to remain strong comrades with the Cuban government and people.\n\n\"It is also to be recorded that this is a stellar achievement for President Barack Obama and one for which history will record him as righting a historic wrong.\n\n\"Further, that the presentations by Comrade Raul Castro and President Barack Obama in their respective capitals to mark this historic achievement - will go down as one of the brightest days for humanity.\n\n\"We celebrate this important development with our brothers and sisters across the United States of America, the Caribbean and in Cuba and indeed the world at large,\" said the PNP statement.",

Tanto el presidente de EEUU, Barack H. Obama, como el de Cuba, Ra\u00fal Castro, agradecieron en sus respectivos comunicados el apoyo del pont\u00edfice a este acercamiento.

Washington decidi\u00f3 liberar a tres esp\u00edas cubanos del llamado grupo de \"Los Cinco\" que cumpl\u00edan condena en el pa\u00eds y La Habana hizo lo propio dejando en libertad al contratista estadounidense Alan Gross, preso en Cuba desde 2009 por actividades subversivas. Los casos de Gross y de Los Cinco se hab\u00edan convertido en una de las principales barreras para el deshielo de las relaciones entre Cuba y Estados Unidos.",

El Papa ha dicho tantas veces algo que me gusta repetir: cuando hay problemas, entonces debe aplicarse el m\u00e9todo del di\u00e1logo, y si hay m\u00e1s dificultades, tiene que haber m\u00e1s di\u00e1logo. Y si este di\u00e1logo es sincero, aunque haya diferencias, se puede trabajar junto. Creo que este es un ejemplo muy importante de esta \"cultura del encuentro\" a la que el Papa invita-, respondi\u00f3.\n\nParolin fue expl\u00edcito en las directrices en pol\u00edtica exterior que les marc\u00f3 Bergoglio tan pronto asumi\u00f3 el papado, en marzo de 2013. Dijo al respecto: \"La Santa Sede sigue lo que el Papa marc\u00f3 en el primer discurso que pronunci\u00f3 al cuerpo diplom\u00e1tico despu\u00e9s de su elecci\u00f3n. Nos record\u00f3 tres puntos: la paz, que siempre ha sido un elemento clave de la acci\u00f3n de la Santa Sede y la diplomacia de la Santa Sede en diferentes periodos de la historia; la lucha contra la pobreza, y luego nos pidi\u00f3 'construir puentes'.\n\n\"En este caso, este 'construir puentes' se expresa a trav\u00e9s de la facilitaci\u00f3n del di\u00e1logo entre las dos partes. La Santa Sede ofreci\u00f3 sus buenos oficios para que las dos partes puedan reunirse y llegar a una conclusi\u00f3n feliz\".\n\nSobre la repercusi\u00f3n que tendr\u00e1 en Am\u00e9rica Latina el cambio de relaci\u00f3n Cuba-Estados Unidos, el responsable de la vieja y experimentada diplomacia vaticana subray\u00f3:\n\n\"Un paso de esta naturaleza tendr\u00e1 efectos positivos en toda Am\u00e9rica Latina. Hay situaciones que deben mejorarse. El hecho de que dos naciones que han tenido tantos problemas y dificultades en sus relaciones logren un acuerdo, tal vez inspire a otros l\u00edderes para tener el mismo coraje que los l\u00edderes de Estados Unidos y Cuba para buscar el camino del di\u00e1logo y del encuentro\".\n\nY recalc\u00f3: \"Es posible el entendimiento, trabajar juntos y encontrar caminos de salida a las dificultades que nos separan\".\n\nPor \u00faltimo, Parolin se refiri\u00f3 a los efectos que en la Iglesia cubana tendr\u00e1 el restablecimiento de estas relaciones diplom\u00e1ticas:\n\n\"La Iglesia tambi\u00e9n ha participado con alegr\u00eda de este momento. Creo que ayudar\u00e1 a la Iglesia a jugar mejor su funci\u00f3n dentro de la sociedad cubana para la construcci\u00f3n de la unidad\".\n\nAyer, el mismo Papa Francisco fue muy claro sobre lo que debe ser el quehacer diplom\u00e1tico, la construcci\u00f3n de \"la paz\" y la \"fraternidad\" entre los pa\u00edses de todo el mundo.\n\nEn un encuentro con los nuevos embajadores ante la Santa Sede, Bergoglio les record\u00f3: \"El trabajo del embajador es un trabajo de peque\u00f1os pasos, de peque\u00f1as cosas, pero que terminan siempre por construir la paz, acercar los corazones de los pueblos, sembrar la fraternidad. Y este es vuestro trabajo, pero con peque\u00f1as cosas, peque\u00f1itas\".\n\nY les puso como ejemplo la reconciliaci\u00f3n entre Cuba y Estados Unidos: \"Hoy estamos todos contentos porque vimos como dos pueblos que se hab\u00edan alejado desde hac\u00eda tantos a\u00f1os, ayer (mi\u00e9rcoles) dieron un paso de acercamiento. Esto fue llevado adelante por embajadores, por la diplomacia. Es un trabajo noble el de ustedes\".\n\nEstas fueron las palabras que -en una ceremonia realizada en el Vaticano- les dirigi\u00f3 el Papa a los nuevos embajadores de Mongolia, Dominica, Tanzania, Dinamarca, Malasia, Ruanda, Finlandia, Nueva Zelanda, Mali, Togo, Bangladesh y Qatar.",

Dejemos que transcurra el tiempo para responder esta interrogante, ya que este proceso de acercamiento reci\u00e9n se ha iniciado, formalmente.\n\nCon todo, una de las lecciones aprendidas es la vigencia de la denominada diplomacia reservada, como un mecanismo para propiciar y restaurar las relaciones bilaterales entre los Gobiernos.\n\nEsta diplomacia reservada -con resultados concretos en este caso- , es distinta de aquella dise\u00f1ada y ejecutada por la \"Vieja Diplomacia\" conocida como la diplomacia secreta, ya que esta \u00faltima fue censurada y proscrita con el fin de la Primera Guerra Mundial. Sugiero a los interesados en esta materia lean \"La Diplomacia\" de Sir Harold Nicolson.\n\nEn consecuencia, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la ret\u00f3rica o anuncios oficiales, en necesario comprender que la Pol\u00edtica Exterior de los pa\u00edses es un asunto serio y complicado, y que en ocasiones se requiere especial precisi\u00f3n, mesura, paciencia y reserva, por estar comprometidos los intereses permanentes del Estado.\n\nFinalmente, el propio Papa Francisco celebr\u00f3 el resultado de las negociaciones como tambi\u00e9n, elogi\u00f3 a la funci\u00f3n diplom\u00e1tica como tal, hecho que debe ponderarse y analizarse debidamente, pues esta actividad o profesi\u00f3n no es cabalmente comprendida ni menos valorada por la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica.",
