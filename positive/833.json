                    "body": "A second baby born with the AIDS virus may have had her infection put into remission and possibly cured by very early treatment - in this instance, four hours after birth.\n Doctors revealed the case Wednesday at an AIDS conference in Boston.  The girl was born in suburban Los Angeles last April, a month after researchers announced the first case from Mississippi.  That was a medical first that led doctors worldwide to rethink how fast and hard to treat infants born with HIV, and the California doctors followed that example.\n In another AIDS-related development, scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of a dozen adults to help them resist HIV.  The results give hope that this approach might one day free at least some people from needing medicines to keep HIV under control, a form of cure.  That study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.\n The Mississippi baby is now 3 1/2 and seems HIV-free despite no treatment for about two years.  The Los Angeles baby is still getting AIDS medicines, so the status of her infection is not as clear.\n A host of sophisticated tests at multiple times suggest the LA baby has completely cleared the virus, said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a Johns Hopkins University physician who led the testing.  The baby's signs are different from what doctors see in patients whose infections are merely suppressed by successful treatment, she said.\n \"We don't know if the baby is in remission ... but it looks like that,\" said Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease specialist at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA who consulted on the girl's care.\n Doctors are cautious about suggesting she has been cured, \"but that's obviously our hope,\" Bryson said.\n Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies.  The Mississippi baby's mom received no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor.  Doctors started the baby on treatment 30 hours after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was infected.\n The LA baby was born at Miller Children's Hospital Long Beach, and \"we knew this mother from a previous pregnancy\" and that she was not taking her HIV medicines, said Dr. Audra Deveikis, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the hospital.\n The mom was given AIDS drugs during labor to try to prevent transmission of the virus, and Deveikis started the baby on them a few hours after birth.  Tests later confirmed she had been infected, but does not appear to be now, nearly a year later.\n The baby is continuing treatment, is in foster care \"and looking very healthy,\" Bryson said.\n The Mississippi girl was treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her.  Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines.\n Bryson is one of the leaders of a federally funded study just getting underway to see if very early treatment can cure HIV infection.  About 60 babies in the U.S. and other countries will get very aggressive treatment that will be discontinued if tests over a long time, possibly two years, suggest no active infection.\n \"These kids obviously will be followed very, very closely\" for signs of the virus, said Persaud, who described the LA case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.\n The study in adults was prompted by an AIDS patient who appears cured after getting a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin from a donor with natural immunity to the virus.  Only about 1 percent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection, and researchers have been seeking a more practical way to get similar results.\n HIV usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface called CCR5.  A California company, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes CCR5.\n Dr. Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania tested it in 12 HIV patients who had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells.  The treated cells were infused back into the patients.\n Four weeks later, half of the patients were temporarily taken off AIDS medicines to see the gene therapy's effect.  The virus returned in all but one of them; that patient turned out to have one copy of the protective gene.\n \"We knew that the virus was going to come back in most of the patients,\" but the hope is that the modified cells eventually will outnumber the rest and give the patient a way to control viral levels without medicines, said Dr. Pablo Tebas, one of the Penn researchers.\n The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored the work with Sangamo and Penn.\n \"The ultimate goal is to create an immune system in the body that's been edited genetically so the cells are not capable of being infected with HIV,\" said director Dr. Anthony Fauci, \"but we are a long way from there at this point.\" \"\nJay Johnson, 53, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment more than three years ago.  Although the virus rebounded when he temporarily went off HIV medicines, tests show his modified blood cells are still multiplying.\n \"Hopefully one day I'll be able to say I'm HIV negative again,\" he said.\n Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

                    "body": "NEW YORK - A second American baby born with the AIDS virus may have had her infection put into remission and possibly cured by very early treatment -- in this instance, four hours after birth.\n Doctors revealed the case Wednesday at an AIDS conference in Boston.  The girl was born in suburban Los Angeles last April, a month after researchers announced the first case from Mississippi.  That was a medical first that led doctors worldwide to rethink how fast and hard to treat infants born with HIV, and the California doctors followed that example.\n In another AIDS-related development, scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of a dozen adults to help them resist HIV.  The results give hope that this approach might one day free at least some people from needing medicines to keep HIV under control, a form of cure.  That study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.\n The Mississippi baby is now 3 1/2 and seems HIV-free despite no treatment for about two years.  The Los Angeles baby is still getting AIDS medicines, so the status of her infection is not as clear.\n A host of sophisticated tests at multiple times suggest the LA baby has completely cleared the virus, said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a Johns Hopkins University physician who led the testing.  The baby's signs are different from what doctors see in patients whose infections are merely suppressed by successful treatment, she said.\n \"We don't know if the baby is in remission .  .  .  but it looks like that,\" said Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease specialist at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA who consulted on the girl's care.\n Doctors are cautious about suggesting she has been cured, \"but that's obviously our hope,\" Bryson said.\n Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies.  The Mississippi baby's mom received no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor.  Doctors started the baby on treatment 30 hours after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was infected.\n The LA baby was born at Miller Children's Hospital Long Beach, and \"we knew this mother from a previous pregnancy\" and that she was not taking her HIV medicines, said Dr. Audra Deveikis, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the hospital.\n The mom was given AIDS drugs during labor to try to prevent transmission of the virus, and Deveikis started the baby on them a few hours after birth.  Tests later confirmed she had been infected, but does not appear to be now, nearly a year later.\n The baby is continuing treatment, is in foster care \"and looking very healthy,\" Bryson said.\n The Mississippi girl was treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her.  Ten months later, when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines.\n Bryson is one of the leaders of a federally funded study just getting under way to see if very early treatment can cure HIV infection.  About 60 babies in the U.S. and other countries will get very aggressive treatment that will be discontinued if tests over a long time, possibly two years, suggest no active infection.\n \"These kids obviously will be followed very, very closely\" for signs of the virus, said Persaud, who described the LA case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.\n The study in adults was prompted by an AIDS patient who appears to have been cured after getting a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin from a donor with natural immunity to the virus.  Only about 1 percent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection, and researchers have been seeking a more practical way to get similar results.\n HIV usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface called CCR5.  A California company, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes CCR5.\n Dr. Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania tested it in 12 HIV patients who had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells.

Doctors started the baby on treatment 30 hours after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was infected.\n The L.A. baby was born at Miller Children's Hospital Long Beach, and \"we knew this mother from a previous pregnancy\" and that she was not taking her HIV medicines, said Dr. Audra Deveikis, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the hospital.\n The mom was given AIDS drugs during labor to try to prevent transmission of the virus, and Deveikis started the baby on them a few hours after birth.\n Tests later confirmed she had been infected, but does not appear to be now, nearly a year later.\n The baby is continuing treatment, is in foster care \"and looking very healthy,\" Bryson said.\n The Mississippi girl was treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her.  Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines.\n Bryson is one of the leaders of a federally funded study just getting under way to see if very early treatment can cure HIV infection.  About 60 babies in the U.S. and other countries will get very aggressive treatment that will be discontinued if tests over a long time, possibly two years, suggest no active infection.\n \"These kids obviously will be followed very, very closely\" for signs of the virus, said Persaud, who described the L.A. case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.\n The study in adults was prompted by an AIDS patient who appears cured after getting a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin from a donor with natural immunity to the virus.  Only about 1 percent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection, and researchers have been seeking a more practical way to get similar results.\n HIV usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface called CCR5.

The virus returned in all but one of them; that patient turned out to have one copy of the protective gene.\n \"We knew that the virus was going to come back in most of the patients,\" but the hope is that the modified cells eventually will outnumber the rest and give the patient a way to control viral levels without medicines, said Dr. Pablo Tebas, one of the Penn researchers.\n The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored the work with Sangamo and Penn.\n \"The ultimate goal is to create an immune system in the body that's been edited genetically so the cells are not capable of being infected with HIV,\" said director Dr. Anthony Fauci, \"but we are a long way from there at this point.\" \"\nJay Johnson, 53, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment more than three years ago.

The donors did not have the natural immunity to HIV.

                    "body": "Boston, MA (CBS) - Doctors announced that they may have possibly cured a second baby born with AIDS by administering antiretroviral treatment merely four hours after birth,\nDoctors revealed on Wednesday that the baby was in remission from the virus at an AIDS conference in Boston.  The girl was born in suburban Los Angeles last April, a month after researchers announced the first case of a possible cure, a baby from Mississippi.  That was a medical first that led doctors worldwide to rethink how fast and hard to treat infants born with HIV, and the California doctors followed that example.\n In another AIDS-related development, scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of a dozen adults to help them resist HIV.  The results give hope that this approach might one day free at least some people from needing medicines to keep HIV under control, a form of cure.  That study was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.\n The Mississippi baby is now 3 1/2 and seems HIV-free despite no treatment for about two years.  The Los Angeles baby is still getting AIDS medicines, so the status of her infection is not as clear.\n A host of sophisticated tests at multiple times suggest the LA baby has completely cleared the virus, said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a Johns Hopkins University physician who led the testing.  The baby's signs are different from what doctors see in patients whose infections are merely suppressed by successful treatment, she said.\n \"We don't know if the baby is in remission ... but it looks like that,\" said Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease specialist at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA who consulted on the girl's care.\n Doctors are cautious about suggesting she has been cured, \"but that's obviously our hope,\" Bryson said.\n Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies.  The Mississippi baby's mom received no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor.  Doctors started the baby on treatment 30 hours after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was infected.\n The LA baby was born at Miller Children's Hospital Long Beach, and \"we knew this mother from a previous pregnancy\" and that she was not taking her HIV medicines, said Dr. Audra Deveikis, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the hospital.\n The mom was given AIDS drugs during labor to try to prevent transmission of the virus, and Deveikis started the baby on them a few hours after birth.  Tests later confirmed she had been infected, but does not appear to be now, nearly a year later.\n The baby is continuing treatment, is in foster care \"and looking very healthy,\" Bryson said.\n The Mississippi girl was treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her.  Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines.\n Bryson is one of the leaders of a federally funded study just getting underway to see if very early treatment can cure HIV infection.  About 60 babies in the U.S. and other countries will get very aggressive treatment that will be discontinued if tests over a long time, possibly two years, suggest no active infection.\n \"These kids obviously will be followed very, very closely\" for signs of the virus, said Persaud, who described the LA case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.\n The study in adults was prompted by an AIDS patient named Timothy Brown who appears cured after getting a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin from a donor with natural immunity to the virus.  Only about 1 percent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection, and researchers have been seeking a more practical way to get similar results.\n Brown said in 2012 that he has not taken his HIV medication since his transplant.  Despite the fact that researchers found traces of HIV in his tissue samples, he claims the virus remnants are dead and cannot replicate.\n Two other HIV positive patients in Boston were reportedly \"cured\" after they received a stem cell transplant to treat their blood cancers in July 2013.  The donors did not have the natural immunity to HIV.  In early 2014, doctors said that the patients had relapsed and had to start taking antiretroviral treatments once again.\n A promising vaccine has also cleared the monkey version of HIV from infected monkeys, but more work has to be done before this treatment can be used on humans.\n HIV usually infects blood T cells through a protein on their surface called CCR5.  A California company, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes CCR5.\n Dr. Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania tested it in 12 HIV patients who had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells.

It is an issue that patients, GPs, pharmacists and hospitals can all play a part in reducing.\" \"\nThe CCG are encouraging doctors and pharmacies to review their repeat prescription systems to ensure that changes to prescriptions are implemented quickly and those medicines which have been stopped are removed from repeat prescription lists.\n This will ensure that only medicines that are needed are issued and avoid the automatic repeat of all items on the list.\n Dr Pidsley added: \"We know some patients do like to have a spare stock of medicines 'just in case' but we recommend only ideally having the maximum supply of two month supply at home.  We really want patients to only order medicines that they need and avoid stockpiling where possible\"\n\"Other patients keep reordering medicines because they are worried that if they don't their doctor may take them off their repeat medication slip.  This is not the case.

Diez meses despu\u0102\u0160s, cuando regres\u0102\u0142, no hallaron indicios de infecci\u0102\u0142n pese a que la madre hab\u0102\u00ada dejado de darle las medicinas para el sida.",

Los m\u00e9dicos aplicaron el novedoso m\u00e9todo de tratamiento en las primeras horas despu\u00e9s de que la madre infectada, residente de California, diera a luz.\n El colectivo, proveniente de un centro m\u00e9dico de la Universidad de California, afirma que la madre no hab\u00eda tomado ninguna medicaci\u00f3n antiviral durante el embarazo.  La infecci\u00f3n fue descubierta poco antes del parto y los an\u00e1lisis posteriores de la sangre del reci\u00e9n nacido confirmaron que hab\u00eda heredado los microorganismos pat\u00f3genos.  Se le aplic\u00f3 la terapia especial y luego, a lo largo de un a\u00f1o, los m\u00e9dicos monitorearon su salud para confirmar que tuvo el efecto deseado.\n Aunque los cient\u00edficos admiten que es demasiado temprano para decir al cien por cien que no se trata de una remisi\u00f3n de la enfermedad, ninguna huella de la infecci\u00f3n ha reaparecido en el tiempo transcurrido.  Es m\u00e1s, los \u00f3rganos vitales del beb\u00e9 evidencian cierta diferencia en comparaci\u00f3n con los pacientes que tienen el VIH suprimido, pero no vencido por completo.\n El beb\u00e9 fue separado de la madre y se encuentra actualmente en un centro de acogida temporal, precisaron los autores del informe.\n El primer caso fue registrado en Misisipi, tambi\u00e9n por el centro m\u00e9dico de la universidad local, y hecho p\u00fablico hace un a\u00f1o.  El beb\u00e9, asimismo, recibi\u00f3 el tratamiento retroviral cuando se descubri\u00f3, durante el parto, que su madre era VIH-positivo.  El paciente tiene ahora 3 a\u00f1os y medio y es completamente sano, aunque la familia no le proporcion\u00f3 ning\u00fan medicamento especial posterior al per\u00edodo perinatal.",
