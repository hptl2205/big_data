Quanta's role, though, is likely to raise questions about what involvement Hon Hai Precision Industry Co , one of Apple's biggest suppliers, will play in production.\n While the watch has been widely expected, the start date of its mass production and the extent of Quanta's involvement were not known until now.  Mass production will start in July and the commercial launch will come as early as October, according to the source and another person familiar with the matter.  The sources requested anonymity because Apple's production plans are private.\n Apple will introduce a smartwatch with a display that likely measures 2.5 inches diagonally and is slightly rectangular, one of the sources said.

The watch is in trial production at Quanta, which will be the main manufacturer, accounting for at least 70 percent of final assembly, the source said.\n Like many other smartwatches, Apple's watch will be able to perform some functions independently, but tasks like messaging and voice chat will require connection to a smartphone, according to the source.

Quanta's role, though, is likely to raise questions about what involvement Hon Hai Precision Industry Co , one of Apple's biggest suppliers, will play in production.\n While the watch has been widely expected, the start date of its mass production and the extent of Quanta's involvement were not known until now.  Mass production will start in July and the commercial launch will come as early as October, according to the source and another person familiar with the matter.  The sources requested anonymity because Apple's production plans are private.\n Apple will introduce a smartwatch with a display that likely measures 2.5 inches diagonally and is slightly rectangular, one of the sources said.  The source added that the watch face will protrude slightly from the band, creating an arched shape, and will feature a touch interface and wireless charging capabilities.\n The source said Apple expects to ship 50 million units within the first year of the product's release, although these types of initial estimates can be subject to change.  The watch is in trial production at Quanta, which will be the main manufacturer, accounting for at least 70 percent of final assembly, the source said.\n Like many other smartwatches, Apple's watch will be able to perform some functions independently, but tasks like messaging and voice chat will require connection to a smartphone, according to the source.  The device will only be compatible with gadgets running Apple's iOS, like its flagship iPhone, one of the sources said.\n Most mainstream smartwatches collect data about the user's heart rate and other health-related metrics, in addition to facilitating tasks like checking e-mail and making phone calls.\n A third source said LG Display is the exclusive supplier of the screen for the gadget's initial batch of production.  It also contains a sensor that monitors the user's pulse.  Singapore-based imaging and sensor maker Heptagon is on the supplier list for the feature, two other sources said.\n Apple declined to comment.  Quanta, LG Display and Heptagon also declined to comment.\n Game-changer?\n Apple's smartwatch will follow similar devices by Samsung, Sony, Motorola and LG Electronics - gadgets that tech watchers say have not been appealing or user-friendly enough to ignite a wave of mass adoption.\n But the market is growing fast, with data firm IDC saying that worldwide shipments of wearable computing devices, including smartwatches, will triple this year over 2013.\n Apple has already dropped hints of its plans in this arena, hiring the former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, a unit of Kering SA, and proclaiming that it will introduce \"new product categories\" this year.\n Many are hoping that Apple's entry into the field of so-called smart wearables will transform the industry like the company's iPhone did in 2007.\n Some forecast that smartphone sales, the current cash cow of the consumer tech world, will lose momentum as the market reaches saturation.\n IDC predicts that worldwide smartphone sales will increase 23 per cent this year, slower than the 39 per cent last year, and that annual growth will average only 12 per cent from 2013 to 2018.",

Apple has hired a former chief executive of French fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, Paul Deneve, for what it called \"special projects.\" \"\nAmong the likely functions are sensors to track health and fitness, including heart rate.  Apple showed its interest in health and fitness-tracking last month with a new app called Health, designed to collect all of a user's fitness and health data in one spot\nApple's entry into the wearable device market is hotly anticipated, though it is behind rivals such as Google Inc. and Samsung Electronics.\n It is hoped that Apple's device will be the breakthrough that makes smartwatches into widely popular devices, just as the introduction of iPhone built the smartphone market.\n Apple's watch will be able to perform some functions independently, but tasks like messaging and voice chat will require connection to a smartphone or other device run on Apple's iOS operating system.\n The company is under pressure to break into new market segments as it's been four years since the release of the iPad.  Under CEO Tim Cook, the company has been investigating the connected home and a wearable device would be a significant new area of growth.\n Market research firm IDC estimates global sales of wearable devices will more than triple this year to more than 19 million units and swell to 111.9 million units by 2018.\n Reuters reports Quanta, which manufactured laptops and iPods for Apple, may be gearing up to produce as many as 50 million units of the product dubbed iWatch.",

Such heavy investment in the material, which is second only to diamond in its hardness, has fuelled speculation they're planning to use the material in larger quantities for a new product.\n While Apple has never commented on the development of the speculated iWatch, CEO Tim Cook has previously promised \"new product categories\" within 2014.

                    "body": "Apple's long-rumored iWatch has turned from an \"if\" into a \"when,\" according to a recent Reuters report claiming mass production will begin next month.  What can you expect from this new device?  The Wire gathered up all of the rumors surrounding the iWatch, to bring you fully up-to-date:\nWhen is it coming out?\n Earlier this month, Nikkei reporter Yuichiro Kanemats heard from sources that the iWatch would hit the market in October.  A source familiar with Apple's iWatch production told Reuters that manufacturing of the watch would begin in July and the commercial launch would come in early October.  Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc. will begin the mass production.  Quanta has previously built Apple laptops and iPods.\n An October launch date seems likely, and in line with past Apple release dates.\n What's it called?\n We don't have an official name, but iWatch seems likely.  Apple could always pull a fast one, as they did changing Healthbook to HealthKit at WWDC earlier this summer.\n What does it look like?\n A source told Reuters the screen display would likely be 2.5 inches and slightly rectangular, with a watch face that protrudes from the band.  The touchscreen would have a slightly arched shape.\n However, another source told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will release several versions of the iWatch this fall.  This opens the possibility for different screen sizes and looks.  KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo also believes this will be the case, saying, \"I expect Apple to launch multiple smartwatches that come with different designs as watches are fashion accessories.  One design doesn't fill all.\" \"\nA variety of different screen sizes would also match the iPhone 6 rumors, which is expected to come in two sizes.\n If you're having trouble imagining it, 2.5 inches is huge for a watch.  Think iCuff, not iWatch.  Here's a \"mock up\" from Mac Rumors:\nAn iWatch with a 2.5-inch screen could have a Retina display of 480x640 with 326 ppi.  As for the band, not much is known, as it is clearly secondary to the screen.  A screen of this size would require at least a two-inch band, making it a bit bulky, and not particularly attractive.\n What can it do?\niWatch's main job will be to measure health metrics, a perfect match to the recently launched HealthKit.  That means being able to collect heart rate information, read pulse, measure breathing, and also measure fitness activity in a way similar to Nike's FuelBand.  It will also be able to send and receive messages and voice chat when linked with an iPhone.  Oddly, in Apple's first HealthKit commercial, they showed off every type of wearable tech except one of their own productions, the iWatch.  Reports say it will also have wireless charging capability.\n How much will it cost?\n UBS analyst Steven Milunovich told investors that the projected average selling price for iWatch is $300.  Nike FuelBand is between $99 and $149, and the Samsung Galaxy Gear is $199.  That would put iWatch at a premium compared to competitors, but considering how loyal Apple fans are, the added cost should not affect sales.\n Will this thing sell?\n The Reuters source said Apple expects to ship 50 million units within the first year.  Milunovich has a more modest prediction, he believes Apple will sell 21 million units in the 2015 fiscal year and 36 million in 2016.  Those projections mean iWatch would add $6.5 billion in revenue to fiscal year 2015 and $11 billion in revenue to 2016.  The Wall Street Journal source estimates between 10 million and 15 million units will be shipped by the end of this year.  As a comparison, Apple sold 71 million iPads in 2013, along with 150 million iPhones.",

One of the sources said that the device will have a slightly rectangular display measuring 2.5 inches diagonally, a size which could indicate a curved design.  The watch face will protrude slightly from the watch band, creating an arched shape, according to the source, and the device will offer a touch interface and wireless charging.\n ADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nRumors of an Apple smartwatch, dubbed the \"iWatch,\" have swirled for years.  Rival Samsung launched its Galaxy Gear watch last year, and unveiled its Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo offerings in February.  Described by Samsung as \"companion devices\", the watches are compatible with the Korean tech giant's Galaxy smartphones.\n The Gear 2 has a flat 1.63-inch inch display and comes with a 2 megapixel camera, a host of fitness features and a music player.\n Sony and Pebble are also playing in this space.  Smartwatches, however, have not exactly generated massive consumer buzz.\n Nonetheless, tech research firm IDC predicts growing momentum in the overall wearable tech market, with device shipments expected to triple from 2013 to exceed 19 million units this year.  The global market for wearable tech is expected to reach 111.9 million units in 2018, according to IDC.\n Smartwatches are part of this trend, which includes devices such as the Nike+ FuelBand.  Set against the backdrop of a growing market, IDC says that demand for smartwatches will grow, but warns that the devices' value preposition for consumers has not yet been fully clarified.\n Apple often schedules product launches around September and October.\n Neither Apple nor Quanta has yet responded to a request for comment on this story.",

Taiwan's Qanta Computer Inc. is taking the lead in the device's assembly, with Korea's LG Display Co. making the watch's panels, at least at first, and Singapore's Heptagon possibly providing sensors, the report said.  Quanta has done work for Apple on its laptops and iPods, but its big role in the high-profile smartwatch will likely raise questions about how fellow Taiwanese tech major Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. , a major Apple supplier, will fit in to the picture, Reuters said.  As for the watch itself, it will likely feature a display with a 2.5-inch diagonal length and include touch interface and wireless charging, Reuters said, and will be compatible only with other devices that use Apple's iOS, Reuters said.  The report also quotes one unidentified person as saying Apple sees itself shipping 50 million of the devices in the first year.  In Asian morning trading, shares of Quanta were up 0.8% in Taipei, with Hon Hai up 0.9%, while LG Display fell 0.5%.

Quanta has produced Macbooks and iPods for Apple in the past.  The company will produce about 70 percent of all iWatches, say the sources.\n There are still very few details of the watch, although a few recent rumors suggest a 2.5-inch (diagonal) arched display, a full touch interface and wireless charging capabilities.  The device will also be powered by iOS 8 (or a variant) and feature HealthKit for fitness tracking.  Of course, the watch can only pair with iOS devices for messaging, emails and more.\n There have been varying estimates of iWatch sales in the first year, ranging from 35 million to 50 million, with a price point of $299.  Even at the low end of the range, the device is expected to be popular.\n Among the other suppliers are LG Display for the screen and Heptagon for the heart rate monitor.\n Source:\nReuters",

With the Free-Form Display, the gate driver's function is dispersed throughout the pixels on the display area.  This allows the bezel to be shrunk considerably, and it gives the freedom to design the LCD to match whatever shape the display area of the screen needs to be.\n For in-vehicle applications, for example, this development makes it possible to have a single instrument panel on the car dashboard that combines a speedometer and other monitors.  Wearable devices with elliptical displays and digital signage and other large monitors that draw the viewer into the onscreen world are also possibilities for the technology.\n Sharp added that it plans to enter the mass-production stage for the Free-Form display at the earliest possible date.",

El lanzamiento de ese nuevo dispositivo cobra m\u00e1s sentido despu\u00e9s de la presentaci\u00f3n de HealthKit, la plataforma dedicada a la salud que forma parte de la nueva versi\u00f3n del sistema operativo del iPhone y el iPad, iOS8, ahora en fase de prueba y con un lanzamiento previsto para el oto\u00f1o.\n Seg\u00fan Reuters, Apple ha encargado a la firma taiwanesa Quanta Computer el 70% de la producci\u00f3n del futuro iWatch.  Entre las caracter\u00edsticas que se apuntan, el reloj de Apple tendr\u00e1 una pantalla curvada ligeramente recangular, de 2,5 pulgadas en diagonal y fabricada por la compa\u00f1\u00eda coreana LG.  La pantalla sobresaldr\u00e1 levemente de la pulsera, con una forma arqueada.  El sistema de carga ser\u00e1 inal\u00e1mbrico y, entre sus sensores, dispondr\u00e1 de uno para la medici\u00f3n del ritmo card\u00edaco fabricado por la compa\u00f1\u00eda Heptagon, de Singapur.  La previsi\u00f3n inicial de ventas del nuevo gadget ser\u00eda de 50 millones de unidades en su primer a\u00f1o, aunque la agencia apunta a que estas estimaciones est\u00e1n todav\u00eda sujetas a posibles cambios.\n Por su parte, The Wall Street Journal apunta a que Apple planea lanzar varias versiones de su reloj inteligente.  A diferencia de Reuters, el peri\u00f3dico asegura que el iWatch se fabricar\u00e1 en diferentes tama\u00f1os de pantalla.  El diario neoyorquino asegura que el iWatch (si es que se llama de esta forma), dispondr\u00e1 de m\u00e1s de 10 sensores, entre los que habr\u00e1 de salud y ejercicio.  Apple aspirar\u00eda de esta forma a superar las cr\u00edticas que suelen recibir este tipo de nuevos dispositivos, los vestibles o wearables, en el sentido de que no alcanzan a ofrecer nada que no tengan ya los mejores tel\u00e9fonos m\u00f3viles del mercado.  Para esta fuente, el fabricante tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 Quanta, que tendr\u00eda un encargo hasta fin de este a\u00f1o de entre 10 y 15 millones de unidades.\n El nuevo dispositivo llegar\u00eda cerca del lanzamiento del nuevo iPhone, que se presentar\u00e1 en septiembre si se mantienen los ritmos de lanzamientos de Apple, y del que se espera un dise\u00f1o extraplano y una pantalla de mayor tama\u00f1o, probablemente de 4,7 pulgadas frente a las 4 pulgadas del actual iPhone 5S/5C.  La posible presentaci\u00f3n de estos modelos coincide con la dristribuci\u00f3n de iOS8 y de Mac OS X, el sistema operativo de ordenadores de Apple, que presentan una fuerte integraci\u00f3n entre ellos.",
