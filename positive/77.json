                    "body": "Bayern Munich seems to be going through a bumpy ride right in the crucial part of the season.\n Dominant until a few weeks ago, Pep Guardiola's team has been less-than-convincing in some recent matches.\n In the Champions League, Real Madrid takes a 1-0 lead into the second leg of the semifinals tomorrow and will seek to use Bayern's recent weakness in defending against counterattacks to its advantage.\n With 14 titles between them, nine of them Madrid's, these are two of the most successful Champions League teams.  Bayern is hoping to become the first team to retain the title.\n Here are five things to know about tomorrow's match:\nTHE RIBERY FACTOR\nFranck Ribery adds an element of the unexpected to Bayern's game.\n The mercurial France winger makes Bayern's game more difficult to figure out.  His dribbling and goal scoring often make the difference.  The problem is, Ribery has been far from stellar in recent weeks.\n Ever since losing out in the Ballon d'Or vote (Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo won the title), Ribery appears to be in a sulking mood.  The sensitive Frenchman has had little impact in recent matches, including the first leg in Madrid.\n Ribery may have woken up just in time.  In Sunday's 5-2 win over Werder Bremen, Ribery scored a goal and played a role in two in what was his best game in weeks.  Coach Pep Guardiola was seen encouraging one of his key players on the touchline.\n \"You know how important he is for this club, for the players.  He played with aggression (against Bremen).  He was playing like he was angry, and he needs that ...  He needs to be angry with himself,\" Guardiola said today.\n \"He's always fighting, fighting, fighting.  He's one of the best players in Bayern's history.  We need him and a good performance to reach the final.\" \"\nPOSSESSION IS GOOD, GOALS ARE BETTER\nPep Guardiola's mantra about controlling possession is coming under scrutiny following a few unconvincing performances.  Bayern dominated in Madrid, especially in the first half, but lost the game to a perfectly executed counterattack finished by Karim Benzema.\n Werder used the same game plan: while Bayern spent most of the first half passing the ball around, Werder used the two chances in had off fast breaks to score two goals, a 100 percent efficiency.  Bayern turned the game around in the second half, when some of its regulars came off the bench.\n Bayern has conceded eight goals in its last three Bundesliga games at home and was ripped apart 3-0 by Borussia Dortmund's counter game.  It is the only one of four semifinalists to have conceded in the first leg.\n \"Madrid is a fast team.  If you lose the ball you have to get back into position straight away.  They're one of the fastest teams in the world,\" Guardiola said.  \"I know (Madrid coach Carlo) Ancelotti's mentality and I rate his football.  I can't imagine he will defend the result for 90 minutes.\n \"Of course, we know what we need.  We need more than one goal to progress.  We also have fast players but they are always in a position to hurt us.\" \"\nMADRID'S NEMESIS\nMunich has not been good to Real Madrid before.  Bayern has eight wins against Madrid at home, with one draw.\n Madrid has a terrible record in Germany: two wins with 19 defeats and six draws.  But Real Madrid eliminated two German sides in the two previous rounds this season, Schalke and Borussia Dortmund.  Madrid won 6-1 at Schalke, but lost 2-0 in Dortmund and came close to being eliminated.\n Madrid and Bayern have met in European Cup semifinals five times, with Madrid coming through only once, in 2000.  In the most recent matchup, Bayern won on penalties in 2012.\n The last two times Real Madrid won the title, it defeated Bayern - in the semifinals in 2000 and in the quarterfinals in 2002.\n RAMOS' REDEMPTION\nIf there is one Real Madrid player more than any other who will be eager to play well at Bayern Munich it is defender Sergio Ramos.\n Ramos, who has lifted several trophies with Madrid and the World Cup with Spain, suffered perhaps his lowest moment as a football player when he missed a spot kick in a penalty shootout against Bayern two years ago at the same stage in the Champions League.\n Bayern went through to the final after goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved Cristiano Ronaldo's and Kaka's spot kicks before Ramos launched his try well high over the bar at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n \"It was hard but you have to put it behind you, look forward and leave bad memories behind you,\" Ramos said.  \"These moments define your professional career.  We hope everything goes well and that I can finally play in a Champions League final.\" \"\nELUSIVE 10th:\nReal Madrid has been seeking that elusive 10th European Cup title since 2002, and missed out the last two seasons by falling in the penultimate stage.\n Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti oversaw Milan's home and away wins (both 2-1) over Bayern in the 2002-03 group stage, then overcame the German side 5-2 on aggregate in the round of 16 in 2006.  In the following season, Ancelotti's Milan got past Bayern in the quarterfinals.\n \"At this stage in the competition the psychological aspect is more important than tactics,\" Ancelotti said.  \"We have to be strong mentally in order to do our best to reach the final.\" \"",

He always wants to fight for the team, that's why the people love him.\n \"He is one of the most fantastic players in the history of Bayern.\" \"\nBayern failed to get a crucial away goal in Madrid, despite dominating the stats with 72 percent possession and firing in 18 shots on goal compared to Real's nine, and Guardiola says his side must be more effective.\n \"I love being in possession of the ball, it was the way I was trained to play the game,\" said Guardiola.\n \"We want the ball to create chances and I want us to be just as dominant as we were in Madrid, but more effective and aggressive, we must find the right balance.\" \"",

                    "body": "After correctly predicting that Real Madrid would win last week's first leg, Kevin Hatchard turns his attention to the return fixture, and he expects goals in Munich...\n No teams have locked horns more frequently than Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in European football's premier competition, and it's the Spanish giants who have the edge going into their 16th meeting.\n While there has been something of an over-reaction to Bayern Munich's 1-0 first-leg defeat, with Pep Guardiola's footballing ethos ruthlessly picked apart, there were elements of the loss that were entirely predictable if you'd watched Bayern in the last few weeks.  I suggested in my preview of the first leg that Bayern would be vulnerable to the counter-attack at the Bernabeu, and so it proved.  Although the European champions dominated possession in the Spanish capital, they couldn't find a breakthrough, and it was Real who created most of the game's best opportunities.\n The debate over the merits of \"tiki-taka\", or whatever you want to call Guardiola's playing style, is a bit of a red herring.  Bayern have romped home in the Bundesliga title race (they wrapped up the league by the end of March), are in the German Cup final, and are still in contention in this Champions League semi-final tie.\n The problem is not what Bayern do with the ball, it's how they recover when the opposition have it.\n Bayern have kept just two clean sheets in their last 16 games, which hints at defensive problems, especially when you consider they have one of the world's best goalkeepers in Manuel Neuer.  On Saturday Bayern won 5-2 against Werder Bremen, but they were 2-1 down at one stage, and Guardiola declared himself \"sad and disappointed\" about his team's first-half performance.\n Guardiola has been put on the defensive by widespread criticism (including from within his own organisation - Franz Beckenbauer accused Bayern of lacking dynamism and punch), and has admitted he needs to find a balance between his style and what Bayern were doing when they won the treble last season.  The problem is that he doesn't have much time to put things right, with Real coming to Munich on Tuesday.\n Real coach Carlo Ancelotti says he'll look to attack at the Allianz Arena, and Los Merengues certainly need to be more forthright than they were in their second leg against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals.\n Real went to Signal Iduna Park with a 3-0 first-leg lead, but looked like rabbits caught in headlights as BVB won 2-0 and came desperately close to forcing extra-time.\n Real are on good form though - they have won all four games they have played since the Dortmund defeat, including a 2-1 King's Cup final success against Barcelona.  Real demolished Osasuna 4-0 at the weekend, and Cristiano Ronaldo looked back to full fitness, scoring twice to take his tally for the season to 50 goals in all competitions.\n Can fully-fit Ronaldo break the record?\n Guardiola has some huge personnel decisions to make.  He made an error fielding Rafinha at right-back in the first leg, with Philipp Lahm deployed in central midfield.  Rafinha isn't an elite defender, and his weaknesses were exposed in the build-up to Real's winning goal last week.\n I was also surprised that Thomas Muller didn't start, as his constant movement makes him a real threat.  Real's centre-backs Pepe and Sergio Ramos found Mario Mandzukic far easier to play against, and the Croatian was unable to impose himself.  Franck Ribery has been in poor form since returning from surgery, but was much better at the weekend, leading Guardiola to remark that the Frenchman plays better when he's angry (maybe Pep will put up a poster of Zahia Dehar).\n I'd be surprised if Ribery and Arjen Robben (seven goals and five assists in last 12 UCL games) aren't used in their usual wide roles, and it's worth noting they are 2.942/1 and 2.6613/8 respectively in the To Score market.\n Real's team news is positive, with Gareth Bale over the virus which limited him to a cameo last week.  Bayern push their full-backs high up the pitch when they camp in the opposition's half, and if they do so again to chase the goals they need, that will be a gilt-edged invitation to both Bale and Ronaldo to lead counter-attacking raids.\n If Bayern hit top gear, Real's defence will be under huge pressure, but I just can't see the visitors failing to score on the counter-attack.  I know that 1.68/13 is a pretty skinny price to recommend, but on this occasion I'll make an exception and tell you to back Yes in the Both Teams To Score market.  If you want a bigger price, then I certainly wouldn't discourage you from backing Over 3.5 Goals at 2.68/5.  If Real score first, the game will open right up.\n The match odds market is a tough to call.  Bayern have lost just once at the Allianz Arena this season, and Opta tell us that Real's record in Germany is atrocious - they have won just twice in 27 matches.\n Real fans would counter that stat by telling you that Ancelotti has never lost to Bayern in the Champions League, with five wins and two draws.  Bayern's incredibly strong home record is behind their price of 1.748/11 for the win, but it's just too short for me to recommend.\n The Bavarians have produced some poor displays of late (the 3-0 home defeat to Borussia Dortmund springs to mind), and if you want a Cash Out opportunity it might be worth backing the Real win at 4.94/1, to then take advantage if the visitors score the opener.",

When he moved into his office at the club's Sabener Strasse headquarters, the Uefa Champions League, the German Bundesliga and the German Cup for the previous season had just taken up residence in the trophy room.\n His challenge was to better that and his employers added two young stars, Mario Gotze and Thiago Alcantara, to the squad to help him.\n Guardiola duly added the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup, as well as a league title defence achieved at record speed.\n His Bayern have compiled some statistical monuments, too, in terms of accuracy of passing and dominance of possession.  But for all that, a heavy judgment on the success, or otherwise, of his first year in Germany, hangs on 90 minutes, or perhaps 120, in Munich on Tuesday night.\n Bayern are unlikely to match, by the end of their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid, the seven-goal aggregate margin by which they blitzed Barcelona under Guardiola's predecessor, Jupp Heynckes, 12 months ago.\n But, should they fail to overturn Madrid's 1-0 advantage, then the comparison between Heynckes's last campaign and Guardiola's first, will be forensically audited by Bayern's bosses, by the German media and by Bayern supporters, who winger Arjen Robben on Monday urged, via the pages of Bild-Zeitung, to \"turn our stadium into an inferno\".\n Criticism of Bayern's display in the first leg centred on their being a little too cool, passing sweetly, as is their trademark, but penetrating seldom, the tempo of their football insufficiently urgent.\n \"I value possession and that's what Bayern bought me here for,\" Guardiola said.  \"In Germany, people like football played on the counter.  I have to find a balance between my ideas and the culture in Germany.\" \"\nHe has to find the way, he also acknowledged, to rev up Franck Ribery, the French winger.  Ribery finished third in voting for the 2013 Ballon d'Or, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi; in other words he was deemed the standout player for Bayern's all-sweeping collective under Heynckes.\n Under Guardiola, his form has dipped in recent weeks, although his goal in the win over Werder Bremen on Saturday, his first in seven matches, may have perked him up.\n Ribery's relative slump is \"the coach's problem\", Guardiola said.  \"Every day I think about what I can do to support Franck.  He's an outstanding player, always wanting to help the team.\" \"\nThe 5-2 league win over Bremen recovered some of the vigour that has defined Bayern over the past two years and gave a retort to suspicions that, by winning the Bundesliga so early - in March - Bayern had allowed themselves to let momentum slip because their weekend fixtures have become academic exercises.\n Unbeaten on the way to seizing the domestic title, they have won only two of the five subsequent league fixtures.  Given that they could only draw 1-1 with Manchester United in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, and lost at Madrid, the fear was that recovering urgency for the matches that matter had become harder.\n Guardiola is also accused of making excessive alterations to the starting XI and switches to starting positions of some players, notably captain Phillip Lahm, who has alternated between full-back and central midfield.\n In his first 50 matches, Guardiola made 173 changes to his starting XIs, an average of more than three per game.  With so much tinkering, the sceptics wonder, should there not be more a distinct Plan B, or C, if the elegant Plan A based around elaborate pass-and-move is not producing the right outcomes?\n Heynckes's Bayern could certainly appear more direct, less wedded to the principle of possession, than Guardiola's.  Should Bayern fall short on Tuesday night, the Heynckes approach will be bathed in a flattering light.\n sports@thenational.ae\nFollow our sports coverage on Twitter @SprtNationalUAE",

Reuters\nBayern Munich have an unenviable task heading into the second leg of their Champions League semifinal.  Not only will the holders need to break down a defense that proved themselves extremely resilient a week ago, but while doing so they will have to guard against the most devastating counter-attacking threat in world soccer.\n Must read Limepocalypse: How To Survive Cinco De Mayo Without Lime This Cinco De Mayo, Beware The Limepocalypse This Time, Blame Exports For Rising US Gas Prices New Cancer Drugs Make Tumors Drug Resistant, More Aggressive Military Docs 'Medicating Troops Into Oblivion'\nReal Madrid have changed considerably this season under Carlo Ancelotti.  In comparison to the days of Jose Mourinho, the team has been much more proactive, focusing on controlling the game through their midfielders, all of whom are more comfortable with the ball than without it.  At times the balance has gone too far in an attacking sense, the 4-3 defeat to Barcelona being a prime example.\n Given the pace they have going forward, though, the option to go back to a counter-attacking style always looms large.  Throughout his decorated coaching career, Ancelotti has shown himself to be unbeholden to any one tactical ideology.  The Italian has always looked to adapt based on the players at his disposal and the specific circumstances.  This has not always worked out (his Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain teams often lacked coherency) but it certainly paid dividends last week at the Bernabeu.  Against the competition favorites, despite being at home, Ancelotti was happy to cede the ball to their opponents and rely on their threat on the break.\n It took some in-game fine-tuning, with Madrid far too passive and much too deep early on, but they achieved a dream result.  A lead without conceding an away goal means that Los Blancos can head into the Allianz Arena knowing that they can rely on the frightening pace of their now fully fit duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale.  After looking less than sharp in the first leg, Ronaldo was back to his best at the weekend, scoring two sensational goal as Real Madrid brushed aside Osasuna to keep their La Liga title hopes alive.  Bale was rested for the fixture after illness, but has been in equally devastating form of late.\n Bale's return to fitness does pose an, admittedly welcome, conundrum for Ancelotti, however.  Much of their success in the first leg was in switching to a 4-4-2 and employing an extremely narrow midfield that blunted Bayern's passing through the middle.  Bringing Bale in would threaten that solidity, but would also give them more of chance to get an away goal that would leave Bayern needing to score three.\n It is Pep Guardiola, though, who has likely spent far more time in the past few days deliberating over his lineup and approach.  While much of the criticism was over the top and almost vitriolic in some circles, it is hard to dispute that Guardiola got things wrong in the first leg.  The decision that backfired most obviously was having the best full-back in the world at the base of midfield, rather than defending against Madrid's strengths down the flanks.  It was down the side that Lahm would have been occupying that Madrid created their only goal and from where they set up two more glorious chances that could have put them three goals to the good before half-time.\n If Ronaldo is switched back to the left in a 4-3-3 the there is even more reason for Lahm to be switched back to what was his default role before this season.  His inclusion in that role would not merely be for defensive purposes.  At full-back, Lahm also provides a valuable extra attacking threat.  When Guardiola finally made the change midway through the second half at the Bernabeu, Bayern had plenty of late joy down that flank with Lahm testing out a struggling Isco.  Regardless of whether Isco plays down that side again in a four man midfield, or Di Maria is there in a three, and whether it is Fabio Coentrao or Marcelo at left-back, it is that side where Madrid are most vulnerable.\n If Guardiola needed another reminder about how valuable Lahm can be out wide, he provided it on Saturday when coming on at half-time and playing a major role in turning a 2-1 deficit into a 5-2 win over Werder Bremen, getting an assist in the process.  If Madrid are to look to pack the center again, then the width that Lahm provides, while allowing Arjen Robben greater freedom to cut inside, could be vital.\n The other change that made a big difference in the first leg was the introduction of Thomas Muller.  He may not be the most refined of players, but his effectiveness is almost unmatched in the world game.  His ability to get into the box and find space as well as offer an aerial presence will provide a Madrid defense, which was all too comfortable for much of the first leg, a different problem.\n Of course, as well as personnel changes, Guardiola is counting on a much improved performance from Franck Ribery.  The man voted the world's third best player earlier this year was anonymous in the first leg.  But having performed much better and gotten a goal against Bremen, Guardiola believes the France international has regained what makes him tick.\n \"He was playing angry against Bremen [in Bayern's 5-2 win on Saturday],\" he said, according to The Guardian.  \"Franck needs this aggression, he needs to play angry.  He keeps fighting and that is why fans love him.  He is one of the best players in Bayern history, he has always performed at the highest level and we need the best Ribery.\" \"\nThere is reason then to believe that Bayern can get the two goals needed to progress to what would be an extraordinary fourth final in five years and stay on course to become the first team to retain the European Cup in the Champions League era.\n Yet, there is also every indication that Madrid will get an away goal.  Bayern again showed their vulnerability to fast-paced counters against Bremen and, having kept a clean sheet just twice in their last 15 fixtures, it is difficult to imagine them keeping Madrid's multitude of threats at bay for the entire 90 minutes.  The Spanish giants should score and it will be a case of whether Bayern can then find the three goals they need.  It is far from beyond them, but it will be a huge task.\n Prediction: Bayern Munich 2-1 Real Madrid\nJason Le Miere Twitter Google Plus RSS\nSports reporter, mainly focusing on my native sport of soccer, but also dabbling in some tennis and Formula One.\n Continue Reading More from Jason Le Miere more articles Bayern Face Mammoth Task To Reach Final Arsenal Look To Continue Revival Dani Alves Provides Perfect Response To Racism Chelsea Deliver Major Blow To Liverpool's Title Hopes",

                    "body": "The first leg of this semi-final saw Bayern dominate possession, but Real create the majority of the best chances and end up 1-0 winners.  James Horncastle assesses the tactical battle as Pep Guardiola goes head to head again with Carlo Ancelotti...\n The tactical brief Carlo Ancelotti drew up for his players last week was presumably entitled Realpolitik: a game plan based on practical considerations rather than ideological notions.\n He knew, for instance, that his opponent Pep Guardiola wouldn't compromise on his philosophy.  He has never changed it for anyone.  Bayern would play Tiki-taka-technik at the Bernabeu.  They'd have almost all of the ball.  Why bother playing them at their own game?  And so Real abandoned their traditions, and their 'house style' to play on the counter-attack.  One newspaper insisted it was a legacy of Jose Mourinho's time at the club.  Its application though wasn't nearly as cynical.\n The home side didn't touch the ball throughout the first quarter of an hour.  Bayern dominated, but theirs was a sterile domination.\n When Real did finally take the ball off them they countered ruthlessly and scored with their first fast-break.  This game offered a stark reminder that possession isn't an end in itself.  It's what you do with it that counts.  Real should have capitalised more from their breathtaking, panic-inducing counters.  Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel di Maria missed glorious chances to put the game and perhaps the tie beyond Bayern.\n It's the only regret.  Ancelotti described Real's 1-0 win as just \"a slight advantage\".  But he also warned Bayern that Ronaldo wasn't 100% fit, nor was Gareth Bale playing.  Both will be in prime condition at the Allianz Arena and so they can therefore expect Real's counter to be quicker and more lethal.  The Spanish giants warmed up for it with a 4-0 win over Osasuna.  Ronaldo scored a brace before being taken off on the hour mark to keep his powder dry for Tuesday night.\n Meanwhile Bayern twice had to come back from behind to beat Werder Bremen 5-2 on Saturday.  There's a degree of concern for them in that 36% of the goals they have conceded this season have come in their last three home games.  Of course, that's indicative of how few they let in until a few weeks ago.  Still, the margins are fine at this level and that's a habit Bayern have got to break if they are to overturn this first leg deficit and progress to the final in Lisbon.\n It's remarkable how Thiago Alcantara's injury appears to have hurt them.  Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario G\u00f6tze can all play a killer pass, but the summer signing from Barcelona perhaps has a greater familiarity with this system, the problems it encounters and how to solve them.  Guardiola has to find an answer if Bayern are to realise their ambition of becoming the first club to retain this trophy since Milan under Arrigo Sacchi in 1990.\n Real know Bayern are not invincible.  Dortmund beat them 3-0 in Bavaria a fortnight ago.  Ancelotti's record against Bayern is also impeccable.  It stands at five wins and two draws.  He has done a lot to lift the historic hoodoo German clubs have on Real as well, hammering Schalke and eliminating BVB this season.\n Madrid are a decent looking price at 4.94/1 to win in 90 minutes but given that a draw is enough for them to qualify, the draw or away win in the Double Chance market at 2.265/4 looks like the way to go.\n Do also bear in mind that whenever Real have knocked out the holders as they did Dortmund in 1998, Manchester United in 2000 and Bayern in 2002, they have gone on to win the Champions League, so take the 2.789/5 on them to do so again before it goes.",

I need to sleep over the balance one more night,\" he said.\n Guardiola added that he does not expect Real to \"park the bus\" by adopting ultra-defensive tactics: \"They will not play to keep the result for 90 minutes.  It's another thing when you press them into defence.\n \"We tried that in the first leg, but, of course, it's clear what we need to advance.  And that is more than one goal.\" \"",

Franck needs this aggression, he needs to play angry.  He keeps fighting and that is why fans love him.  He is one of the best players in Bayern's history, he has always performed at the highest level and we need the best Ribery.\" \"\nBayern again got off to a slow start against Bremen before an explosive second-half saw them cruise past their opponents with Ribery among the goals.\n Guardiola is hoping to lead Bayern to a record back-to-back Champions League triumph in his first season.  The Munich outfit could as well equal Juventus' record of having reached three successive finals in Europe's top tier club football competition.\n They need overturn Real's 1-goal lead from the first leg and keep the attack duo of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo at bay to stand a chance of progressing to the final.\n The Spanish boss says he does not expect the 'Los Blancos' to play for the goalless draw that would ensure their passage to the Lisbon.\n \"I cannot imagine the (Real coach) Carlo Ancelotti will set up his team in such a way as to just keep the result,\" added Guardiola.  \"That would be difficult to maintain.\n \"Obviously it is clear what we need to do.  We need to score more than one goal.\n \"Real are a quick team so we always have to be positioned well when we lose possession.  The best is to keep them a long way from our goal.\" \"",

But I will continue to step on the gas.  I hope that I will get the trust of the coach soon,\" the 21-year old midfielder told Bild.\n Goetze has made 40 appearances for Bayern in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and Champions League this season.\n He has started 29 games, come off the bench 11 times and was substituted in 16 matches, scoring 12 goals and providing 11 assists.\n The former BVB star is one of a few players appearing to have lost momentum in recent months.\n In an in-depth analysis of Bayern's problems, kicker singles out Pep Guardiola as the key to the crisis.\n What makes it particularly striking is the sheer force of how Guardiola comes under fire from Germany's leading football magazine, which is not known to be too critical of the Bundesliga champions.\n \"Pep Guardiola has tattered a squad that was absolutely intact, both from a human and sporting perspective,\" chief reporter Karlheinz Wild commented in his op-ed article headlined: \"Pep Guardiola follows in the footsteps of Louis van Gaal.\" \"\nWild, like many other German journalists in recent weeks, blames Guardiola for his \"the Bundesliga is over\" statement, which has led to concerns on and off the pitch.\n \"Internal phenomena need to be sorted out.  They -- even if, right now, they are not as dramatic -- are reminiscent of Louis van Gaal,\" Wild wrote, and hinted at \"problems on a personal level\" between players and coach.\n Kicker then focused on \"how under Guardiola a 7-0 against Barcelona [in the 2013 Champions League semifinal] turned into a 0-5 against Real\", the lack of a Plan B against Los Blancos' counter attacks, the zonal marking during set-pieces as well as the use of Bastian Schweinsteiger in a defensive role.\n \"Given this squad, the dream to defend the Champions League title as the first club ever had been realistic.  It has ruthlessly been destroyed.  Guardiola wants to stick to his style,\" kicker said.\n A page on, the paper headlined \"four players, four problems.\" \" Kicker again claimed that Schweinsteiger is played \"in the wrong place\" as he needs a defensive back-up like Spain international Javi Martinez, who has been \"degraded to a part-time worker\", and, according to kicker, would be welcomed at FC Barcelona anytime.\" \"\nEven Thomas Mueller, who, like Goetze, has not been with his role at the club in recent weeks, has reportedly internally addressed his discontent with the situation.\n \"Mueller can deliver a strong argument: Louis van Gaal wants to bring him to Manchester United, should he be the next manager at the club.  And right now it looks like this will happen.  Then Mueller will also be interested,\" kicker said.\n Franck Ribery, who could face a ban for his slap in the face of Real Madrid right back Daniel Carvajal, could also be a cause for Guardiola's concern, says kicker.\n Guardiola defended his style in a prematch news conference on Friday morning, stating: \"All I have are my ideas...W We will play with my ideas.  Otherwise I can't train here, if I had to say something I don't feel.\n \"That would not be good for the club and the players, who are very intelligent and visceral.  They would not trust me otherwise.  And in the end the club needs to decide whether this coach with those ideas is the best for the club.  But that's not my thing.\n Guardiola insists that Bayern fell to Real Madrid due to not having enough of the ball, despite official statistics showing that Die Roten enjoyed 63 percent possession.\n \"I am more and more and more convinced of my idea.  Why did we lose?  Because we were bad in the first half.  We did not have the ball.  I am strong.  I received a lot of criticism, not only here but also in Spain.  But that's my job.\n \"When you lose 4-0, you can'y expect that the people help me.  That's normal.  Looking at our first half, I deserve all the criticism I get.  I need to accept that.  The big defeat will stay in my head and heart forever.  You can't forget it.\" \"",

Debemos jugar al ataque\".\n Sin embargo, en una muestra m\u00e1s de su facilidad para el sarcasmo y la iron\u00eda, el catal\u00e1n explic\u00f3 que poco hab\u00eda que hacer ya, puesto que algunos medios ya hab\u00edan colocado a su rival en la \u00faltima ronda.  \"He le\u00eddo que el Real Madrid ya est\u00e1 en la final y que ya la gan\u00f3\", brome\u00f3 Guardiola, que asegur\u00f3 que ellos no dan la eliminatoria por perdida y que ven \"las cosas distintas\" y que intentar\u00e1n renovar el t\u00edtulo.  \"Es dif\u00edcil pero vamos a hacerlo todo para conseguirlo\", anunci\u00f3.\n El catal\u00e1n ha vuelto a reiterar la idea de que el Real Madrid es peligroso por la velocidad de sus atacantes: \"Ni poniendo a los defensas m\u00e1s rapidos del mundo les puedes frenar.  Pienso que los equipos buenos, cuanto m\u00e1s lejos del \u00e1rea, mejor, por eso nosotros jugamos as\u00ed.  Podr\u00edamos cambiar la manera de jugar y echarnos atr\u00e1s para que no tuvieran espacios para correr, pero entonces nos meter\u00edan muchos centros y nos provocar\u00edan muchas faltas, donde Bale y Cristiano son muy peligrosos.  No es f\u00e1cil frenar a este equipo, a este tipo de jugadores no les paran ni los m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidos del mundo.  Pero bueno, he visto el partido repetido y a lo mejor nos protegemos un poco m\u00e1s\".\n Sin embargo, se declara conocedor del Real Madrid y defiende las virtudes del equipo blanco: \"Por la mentalidad de su entrenador s\u00e9 que van a salir a marcar, no creo que vayan a estar 90 minutos defendiendo.  Para estar en Lisboa tendremos que marcar m\u00e1s de un gol porque ellos van a salir pensando en marcar.  Nosotros podemos tambi\u00e9n salir a esperar un poco y pillarles a la contra, porque tambi\u00e9n tenemos jugadores r\u00e1pidos\".\n Esto coincide con su filofos\u00eda de juego, algo que Guardiola ha querido explica en la rueda de prensa: \"Cuando hablo de f\u00fatbol intento poner argumentos, pero no puede ser que cuando pierdo y doy argumentos ponga excusas y cuando gano soy un iluminado.  Ni lo uno ni lo otro.  Yo amo tener el bal\u00f3n para tener m\u00e1s ocasiones y recibir pocos contragolpes.  No me gustan las estad\u00edsticas, no creo en ellas.  En Madrid lanzamos m\u00e1s corners, tiramos m\u00e1s, tuvimos m\u00e1s el bal\u00f3n, pero el resultado no nos dio la raz\u00f3n.  Tenemos que ser m\u00e1s efectivos.  No me gusta tener el bal\u00f3n todo el partido para tener dos ocasiones, porque eso es una casta\u00f1a\".\n \"Rib\u00e9ry, el mejor del mundo\"\nTambi\u00e9n ha querido defender la labor de sus jugadores en Madrid, afirmando el orgullo que siente por ellos: \"No puedo como entrenador hacer una cosa en la que no creo, por eso siempre pido tener el bal\u00f3n.  Me quedo con la valent\u00eda de mis jugadores en Madrid, que salieron al ataque y tuvieron la pelota.  Quiero jugar igual pero con un poquito m\u00e1s de agresividad.  Lo que organiza el f\u00fatbol es el bal\u00f3n, no meter siete jugadores en el \u00e1rea\".  Adem\u00e1s, ha destacado la importancia que va a tener la afici\u00f3n en el encuentro: \"Necesitamos a la afici\u00f3n.  No creo que yo como entrenador tenga que decir a la afici\u00f3n lo que debe hacer, ellos lo saben.  El Madrid cont\u00f3 con una ayuda de su afici\u00f3n fant\u00e1stica y yo s\u00e9 que la del Bayern va a estar con nosotros.  Ellos nos van a ayudar mucho, pero los goles no los pueden marcar ellos\".\n Para terminar, ha elogiado a Bale y a Isco, diciendo que \"juegue quien juegue se controlar\u00e1n unos detalles\" y ha destacado la labor de Ribery, criticado en los \u00faltimos partidos, en el equipo: \"Es un jugador muy importante.  Es importante que sea agresivo, nos ayuda mucho cuando juega as\u00ed.  Rib\u00e9ry afronta cada partido con la misma pasi\u00f3n y merec\u00eda este a\u00f1o haber sido nombrado el mejor jugador del mundo.  Necesitamos su mejor versi\u00f3n para eliminar al Real Madrid\".",
