The stolen images quickly spread on social networking websites such as Twitter and Facebook when several of the victims confirmed the photos were authentic.\n\n\"So 2 to 3 days ago there was a thread where some dude was selling celebrity nudes for bitcoin, J[ennifer] Lawrence and Kate Upton, etc,\" a post on 4chan, believed to be the first, said. \"[I] thought it was a scam, but i managed to get some samples, post ending 9 decides if I post 'em.\"\n\nThe person later posted intimate photos of Kate Upton, which her attorney confirmed are authentic. The person who published the photos also claimed that the person responsible for the theft was still attempting to sell nude photos of about 100 celebrities, including Hillary Duff, Kim Kardashian, Kirsten Dunst, Mary-Kate Olsen, McKayla Maroney, Rhianna, Selena Gomez, and Vanessa Hudgens.\n\n\"The dude wanted 2btc for one set,\" the person said, referring to the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which currently trades at about $480 per bitcoin.\n\nThe vast majority of stolen photos were not published by Monday afternoon, but photos and videos belonging to about a dozen celebrities were being circulated online, including some which were confirmed to be authentic. Representatives of both Upton and Lawrence said authorities had been notified.\n\nIt is believed the images were stolen through a recent flaw in Apple's iCloud service, which automatically stores copies of photos taken by iPhones. The bug allowed a malicious user to repeatedly guess passwords on Apple's \"Find my iPhone\" service without alerting the user or locking out the attacker. An Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA user of the social networking website Reddit, who followed clues left behind by a person attempting to sell more photographs, said he had identified the person responsible as a 26-year-old man from the Greater Atlanta area in the state of Georgia. Neither the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Office nor the FBI's Field Office in Atlanta would comment on whether the man, whose name is being withheld from this article, was being investigated.\n\n\"This is obviously an outrageous violation of our client Kate Upton's privacy,\" attorney Lawrence Shire said in an e-mailed statement through Upton's publicist. \"We intend to pursue anyone disseminating or duplicating these illegally obtained images to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Jennifer Lawrence also confirmed the photos were authentic and demanded they were not republished by media organizations. \"This is a flagrant violation of privacy,\" she said. \"The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.\"\n\nFashion model Ali Michael appeared to have been the worst hit, with nearly 150 photos and seven videos of her being circulated. Although she did not immediately comment on whether the images were authentic, a brief update on her Twitter account appeared to refer to the images. \"Cool,\" she wrote as word spread about the images, in which she appears mostly topless.\n\nUpton was also hit hard, with more than 100 photos and several videos having been published, including nude and intimate images that show her with her partner Justin Verlander. Eight photographs of actress Becca Tobin - some of which show her nude next to a Christmas tree - were also being circulated, to which the actress responded on Twitter: \"Merry XXXmas!\"\n\nActress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is best known for her roles in 'Final Destination 3' and two of the 'Die Hard' movies, was furious at the release of at least six nude photos. \"To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, [I] hope you feel great about yourselves,\" she wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn a second tweet she added: \"Knowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this. Feeling for everyone who got hacked.\" She later said she was \"going on an internet break\" after some users of the social networking website lashed out at her.\n\nDozens of photographs said to show 'Nickelodeon' star Victoria Justice, including several in which her breasts are exposed, were also being circulated, though the actress claimed they were fake. \"These so called nudes of me are FAKE people. Let me nip this in the bud right now. pun intended,\" she wrote on her Twitter account.\n\nInternet users who compared the nude photos to known photos of Justice noticed similarities in the surroundings and clothing, and were certain the photos were legitimate. Gossip website HollywoodLife, citing an unidentified source close to Justice, reported that the actress was \"flipping out\" over the situation and had expressed shock that other celebrities had confirmed the authenticity of the photos.\n\nEnglish actress Jessica Brown Findlay, who is best known for her role in 'Downton Abbey,' was also a victim of the theft, with eleven photos and seven videos being circulated, some of which show her in extremely intimate situations with a partner. Australian actress Teresa Palmer and 'Spider-Man' actress Kirsten Dunst were also victims of the theft.\n\nThe authenticity of other photographs, which allegedly show several other celebrities, could not be immediately confirmed.\n\nIn a similar case in December 2012, Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida, was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison after he hacked into the personal e-mail accounts of more than 50 people, including actresses Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Renee Olstead. He later posted several nude photographs of Johansson.\n\n(Copyright 2014 by BNO News B.V. All rights reserved. Info: sales@bnonews.com.)",

Elisabetta A. Villa / WireImage Share Tweet Pin\n\nThanks (or no thanks, really, because this is all sorts of gross) to an apparent security flaw in Apple's iCloud remote storage system, hackers have reportedly accessed over 100 celebrities' nude photos -- 102 and counting, if current lists of those caught up in the scandal are to be believed. As Gawker notes, a poster at infamous Internet forum 4chan promised last week that scandalous, oh-so-scandalous pictures would emerge Sunday night; lo and behold, they did. At least, some of them did. Those cataloging the photos, because of course people are, include the following potentially* exposed celebs:\n\nJennifer Lawrence (and, arguably, JLaw's best friend too)Ariana GrandeKate Upton (and Upton's boyfriend, baseball player Justin Verlander, whose bare butt appears in at least one photo)Lea MicheleVictoria JusticeKaley CuocoGlee's Becca TobinDownton Abbey's Jessica Brown FindlayMcKayla MaroneyKirsten DunstBrie LarsonTeresa PalmerAubrey PlazaMary Elizabeth Winstead\n\n*Mass debates are currently raging as to whether many of these images are legit.\n\nThat said, three celebs, or their legal representatives, have confirmed that 'their' leaked photos are the real, naked deal. Here's Jennifer Lawrence's rep, in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, among other outlets:\n\n\"This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.\"\n\nAnd here's Kate Upton's rep, in a similarly-outraged statement to The Daily Mail:\n\n\"This is obviously an outrageous violation of our client Kate Upton's privacy [and] we intend to pursue anyone disseminating or duplicating these illegally obtained images to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead took to Twitter:\n\nTo those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves.\n\n-- Mary E. Winstead (@M_E_Winstead) August 31, 2014\n\nKnowing those photos were deleted long ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this. Feeling for everyone who got hacked.\n\n-- Mary E. Winstead (@M_E_Winstead) August 31, 2014\n\nAmong the celebs listed at 4chan whose photos haven't leaked yet (but might) are Kim Kardashian, Farrah Abraham, Rihanna, Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Cara Delevingne, Hayden Panettiere, and one guy, literally one guy, Dave Franco, who apparently appears in a nude shot with Alison Brie. Gawker reports that TMZ has attempted to buy \"a trove\" of photos, noting a tweet that says the site offered \"six figures\" for some pics, and also a 4chan posting, apparently from the original hacker, which reads \"I'd rather you get them than TMZ.\" TMZ has not yet commented on this rumor.\n\n4chan is a wild and nefarious part of the Internet that I can't even pretend to understand; a cursory visit this morning (I clicked through 10 pages of the site's /b/ forum, where the celebrity nudes began being uploaded last night) yielded nudes both male and female, strange memes, lots of people throwing racial and homophobic slurs at each other/the world, and, oh, this request, which is SFW and yet still sums up the rampant messiness quite well:\n\nShare Tweet Pin\n\nIt's worth noting the authenticity of much (i.e. just about everything, including this mayo raccoon scene request above ) posted on 4chan is up for the debate -- at least so far, only Lawrence, Upton, and Winstead have confirmed that their pictures are legitimate, as noted above. Other celebrities and their representatives are denying the photos are for real, like Victoria Justice:\n\nThese so called nudes of me are FAKE people. Let me nip this in the bud right now. *pun intended*\n\n-- Victoria Justice (@VictoriaJustice) August 31, 2014\n\nAnd Ariana Grande, whose publicist told BuzzFeed the photos are \"completely fake.\" A screencapped tweet reportedly from Ariana herself added that \"my petite ass is much cuter than that.\" That tweet does not appear on Grande's Twitter feed currently however, and so it could also prove to be a fake.\n\nBecause just about everyone posting on the site remains anonymous, copycat hackers are now reposting all sorts of real/fake images. Many are promising further leaks if people are prepared to pay up, which muddies the already muddy waters.\n\nIn the same vein, some 4chan posters claim to have identified the hacker -- based upon computer server and network details identifiable on desktop screenshots taken of the apparently-original photo collection. But then others disagree; everything is gospel but nothing is for real. \"No one hacks, steals or in some other way buys high-profile nude pictures of 30 A/B-list celebrities and doesn't anonymise properly when posting them,\" argues one.\n\nRegardless, the momentous event is already being nicknamed \"The Fappening,\" because to \"fap,\" in Internet lingo, is to enjoy some self-pleasure. And many of the posters at 4chan (as well as in subforums across Reddit and beyond) are more than happy to acknowledge that's all they'll be doing this Labor Day. Happy holidays, people!\n\nThis post will be updated with more information as it breaks.\n\nShare Tweet +1 Pin Comment Email We Recommend 01 \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" Recap: Scott... 02 Were Nude Photos of Jennifer Lawrence Just Leaked... 03 Lea Michele's 28th Birthday Party Was Better Than... 04 North West Has a Baby Beauty Routine, Because Of...

Moreover, the hacker is also claiming to have explicit videos of Lawrence, as well as over 60 nude selfies of the actress. In addition to Lawrence, other names on the list posted to 4Chan of victims include: Aly and AJ Michalka, Avril Lavigne, Amber Heard, Becca Tobin, Brie Larson, Hayden Pannettiere, Hope Solo, Hillary Duff, Jenny McCarthy, Kayley Cuoco, Kate Upton, Kate Bosworth, Keke Palmer, Kim Kardashian, Kirsten Dunst, Krysten Ritter, Laura Ramsey, Lea Michele, Lizzy Caplan, Mary Kate Olsen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rihanna, Scarlet Johansson, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Wynona Ryder, as well as a shot of Alison Brie with Dave Franco. You can see the full list here.\n\nSeveral photos have already started to show up on various message boards across the internet and celebrities have started challenging their authenticity. Actress Victoria Justice, who was also targeted in the hack, tweeted, \"These so called nudes of me are FAKE people, let me nip this in the bud right now. *pun intended*\"\n\nOthers are understandably quite upset by the breach and have confirmed its authenticity. A spokesperson for Jennifer Lawrence released a statement to the Huffington Post confirming the pictures saying, \"This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.\"\n\nPosters on 4chan and Reddit are claiming that the celebrities were hacked through Apple's iCloud platform, but this has yet to be verified. Though Apple does not exactly offer the highest security protocol, with end to end 128-bit AES encryptions, the inclusion of videos to the ransom makes the weaknesses of iCloud as the only culprit highly improbable. This is because unlike pictures that are automatically uploaded to the cloud, videos require extra effort from the user to intentionally put it there.\n\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak shared his concerns about the cloud back at the start of last month stating, \"I really worry about everything going to the cloud,\" he said. \"I think it's going to be horrendous. I think there are going to be a lot of horrible problems in the next five years...With the cloud, you don't own anything. You already signed it away\"\n\nThough it is not for certain that iCloud is the culprit, Wozniak's does have a point that cloud storage providers have faced some pretty embarrassing security breaches over the last few years. One can only hope that breaches like these will be enough of a call to action for them to get their act together and take the necessary precautions.",

I say that from a few different perspectives -- as a woman, as a geek, and as a journalist. This month was almost over. And then this happened.\n\nNews broke yesterday that nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence had been \"leaked\" online. The truth is they were stolen. They were hacked from her personal technology. They were posted online without her consent. This is a crime. And possibly worst of all, this is something women are supposed to expect.\n\nI can't see more than half of the replies to that tweet because I blocked those blaming the victim. I blocked so many users I lost count. As the story developed further it turned out that over 100 celebrities had been hacked, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Kirsten Dunst, Hope Solo, Cat Deeley, Kate Upton and her MLB boyfriend boyfriend Justin Verlander, Aubrey Plaza, Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Lea Michele, and Hillary Duff. Hackers got into the individuals' Apple iClouds, stole images from their phones, posted them on 4chan; the user believed to be responsible asked for Bitcoins in exchange. The photos have since disseminated onto social media and countless other websites. At least one person on the hack list, Victoria Justice, says the photos of her are fake.\n\nLawrence's representative gave a statement to The Hollywood Reporter: \"This is a flagrant violation of privacy. The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.\"\n\nThat didn't stop Perez Hilton from posting the photos on TMZ... and then removing them and apologizing for it. \"At work we often have to make quick decisions. I made a really bad one today and then made it worse. I feel awful and am truly sorry,\" he wrote. \"Upon further reflection and just sitting with my actions, I don't feel comfortable even keeping the censored photos up. I am removing them.\"\n\nWe live in a society where women's bodies are a commodity to be sold, whether they agree to it or not. And some of the same people who complain about the NSA or Facebook invading their personal privacy will be the same people searching and spreading around these photos. Winstead had this to say in response:\n\nIn 2012, the man responsible for posting stolen nude photos of Scarlett Johansson was sentenced to 10 years in jail. Authorities are looking into the current case, but already reddit has outed one of the people allegedly responsible, 27-year-old Bryan Hamade. Hamade, speaking to BuzzFeed, denied his involvement:\n\n\"I am not behind this. It was so stupid -- I saw a lot of people posting the actual leaks and bitcoin addresses and I've read a lot about bitcoin and how they're are valuable and I thought, oh cool I'll get free bitcoins,\" he told BuzzFeed.\n\n\"I am just an idiot who tried to pull one over on 4chan and lost big time and stupidly left this identifying information.

I have no idea how the hell someone could hack into all those accounts,\" he said.\n\nHamade, speaking on the phone as he was driving around trying to find an open law office so he could hire a lawyer, told BuzzFeed he and his family have been harassed by 4chan users since his allegedly Photoshopped post went live.\n\n\"It's been a nightmare and I haven't slept in 34 hours, now. 4chan users are harassing me with non-stop phone calls and emails. They email me constantly, emailing saying they'll hack my personal websites and keep calling my phone, calling me a fag and then hanging up. They also said they'll hack my mom's site, so I took it down,\" he said.\n\nI believe we'll never be able to change some peoples' way of thinking. No matter what, they'll always think a woman could have done something more to prevent themselves from being violated, even if they'd never hold other crimes to the same unbudging standard. But it's incredibly important to keep reminding people not to blame the victim and instead to focus on why these crimes happen.\n\nThe person or persons who stole these photos and posted them online knew exactly what they were doing and why, but society as a whole doesn't necessarily understand why it's not OK for them to have done it. We've all been brainwashed in one way or another to believe women who look or act a certain way can be treated a certain way with no consequences. We've also been told women should act one way and men another. When we try and talk about these issues it's not to demolish the things which make us who we are, but to let others know it's OK not to fit a certain mold. Perhaps the mold you're in is doing you more harm than good. It's why we discuss the harmful messages some of our favorite media sends. We want people to open their eyes, and we want things to change for better.\n\nIt may seem like a long leap from discussing sexualized comic book art to stolen photos being published online without consent, but it's not. It's the little things we let pass that lead to the bigger misconceptions about consent, harassment, and the right to ones' body. People like to argue that things like online harassment exist because they don't see it. They do. They just don't recognize it, because they've been taught it's just a part of life. Let's shove that misconception down the garbage disposal. Enough is enough.",

                    "body": "As the dust settles after yesterday's seemingly endless parade of hacked celebrity nudes, it's become clear that some of the photos had been circulating around the web for a while. Even Deadspin readers were aware of them. But where did they originate, and how did they leak widely so suddenly? One anonymous image message board might hold the answer -- if it's not the source of the leaks itself.\n\nThe board is called AnonIB, and according to Encyclopedia Dramatica it was started in 2006 after a mutiny temporarily splintered 4chan's infamous /b/ board. Its current manifestation -- it's been shut down or changed design several times in its short life -- has existed since March 1.\n\nAnonIB, like /b/, is an anonymous image board, but one that focuses more or less exclusively on pornography -- in particular, stolen or leaked nudes of non-celebrity women, arranged on the site in endless and unsearchable 4chan-style threads sorted by state or country of origin. In effect, the board's most infamous sections operate like an dizzying combination of Is Anyone Up? and Photobucket Plunder, served up in the anarchic and baffling style of 4chan.\n\nEarlier this week (days before imgur galleries were passed around the greater internet) a thread dedicated to Jennifer Lawrence was bumped by an AnonIB poster who intimated that posters on /stol/ -- the forum's \"obtained images\" (read: hacked nudes, often for revenge purposes) sub-board -- were in possession of some... interesting photos.\n\nNaturally -- given the general nature of the internet and that AnonIB has an entire board dedicated to fake celebrity nudes -- many posters in the Lawrence thread were initially skeptical of the claims.\n\nMeanwhile, over on /stol/other posters began hawking what they said were stolen celeb nudes for sale or trade.\n\nThough that poster brags that he is \"ripping iclouds\" -- allegedly the method with which the cache of nude photos was cultivated -- it's unclear if he is one of the culprits or merely a peddler posing as one. Nonetheless, the posts make it apparent that the photos have been floating around the makeshift hacked nude black market for some time, a theory confirmed by an email sent to Deadspin weeks ago.\n\nAs the week wore on, posters alleging to have access to the photos had migrated over from /stol/ to the Jennifer Lawrence thread, though they were still being met with skepticism.\n\nBut by Sunday the regulars in the Lawrence thread started to get wind of the same images that were being passed around for the world to see, and as more of the genuine photos began to hit the thread, the cynicism about their existence began to melt.\n\nSurfing around /stol/ and /c/, the celeb board (both of which have been experiencing outages), seems to indicate that grandiose claims about exactly how many female celebrities might have been hit may not be as crazy as they seem. One poster revealed screenshots of a master folder on his Mac that contains dozens upon dozens of sub-folders with names of female celebrities -- from Cara Delevingne to Iggy Azalea to Lizzy Caplan to Mary Kate Olsen -- who have not otherwise been involved in this mess.\n\nAt the same time, a number of fake or misidentified images -- of Selena Gomez, among others -- appear to have been caught up and included in some of the circulated galleries.\n\nBut while publicists and Redditors try to sort through the authenticity of each claim, some AnonIB users are teasing what appear to be still unreleased images as proof that there are many more hacked nudes than what trickled into the mainstream yesterday. One poster, when pressed to provide evidence, revealed truncated galleries that he says contain stolen photos of Kate Bosworth, Hayden Panettiere and Leelee Sobieski.\n\nIt figures that a sustained hacking enterprise with this sort of reach would have been conducted over the span of months, and another AnonIB user appeared to confirm that theory early Monday morning. (It goes without saying that anonymous message board postings should be treated as highly suspect.)\n\nMeanwhile on AnonIB's /c/ board, a poster -- in his own words \"not the hacker, just a collector\" -- seeking bitcoin donations in exchange for further leaks claimed to have been IP blocked by AnonIB. \"I didn't just take the money and run,\" he told the board. \"I'll come back in the morning.\"\n\nScreenshots of an apparent email conversation with one leaker (dating back to Friday) were also circulating on Reddit. It's unclear who \"the guy\" who came out of \"hiding\" is:\n\nThe hack should act as a wakeup call for just about anyone on Earth -- from celebrities to normal grunts -- who blindly followed the tech industry down the path of cloud storage. But, unsurprisingly, the users of AnonIB, at least for the moment, have much more local concerns.\n\nKnow anything else? Want to correct, clarify, contextualize or augment our information?

A few weeks ago, someone emailed us with a weird story involving pictures of nude celebrities that, without going into it in detail, sounded and sounds like total bullshit. But then there was today's celebrity nude pic deluge, and now we're perplexed.\n\nWe'll skip the original email, since it made a variety of unsupported inferential leaps involving a celebrity doing something implausible. Still, mildly intrigued, one of our writers reached back to the tipster, and got the following response.\n\nOk listen, there's this guy who messaged my girlfriend on facebook saying he would pay 5k for her to send either naked pics or videos. (\"Sex would never be a requirement\").\n\nAs any guy would, I messaged him to tell him to fuck off. He then proceeded to explain how he has naked pics and videos of a bunch of famous people. He sent me pretty legitimate pics of McKayla Maroney, Jennifer Lawrence, Alana Blanchard, Aubrey Plaza, and Victoria Justice. Most of them are topless or naked and he blacked out a couple of the J-Law ones. He says if I want the pics to send me pics of my girlfriend lol, which won't happen. I'm still trying to get more out of this guy, who also claims he invented the patent for Reverse image search to Google. This might be sketchy but wouldn't you like to know how he has all of these pics? I'll send them to you too if you want\n\nOne of our writers, intrigued by the idea of a presumably wealthy tech bro using nude photos of famous people to harass internet users, followed on and heard this:\n\nI'll send you all pictures and my communication with this guy when I get back home later tonight.\n\nWe didn't get any pictures and communications from the tipster after that. No photos or anything. Still ... all those names have surfaced on the alleged master list of nude photos. (Victoria Justice claimed her leaked photos were fake.) We have no idea what to make of this. Someone or other -- call him Pervert Zero -- was touting this specific list of celebrity nudes, and apparently attempting to use it to get random internet users' nudes. Was the guy who leaked the nudes today Pervert Zero, or someone else? If the leaker wasn't Pervert Zero, did he hack him, rather than (as he claims) iCloud? This is all confusing; maybe there's something else entirely going on. At any rate, these photos appear to have been floating somewhere in the bowels of the internet one way or another for awhile, and yet in trying to figure anything out about them, we're stuck at a dead end. We tried contacting our original tipster today with no response. Know anything about some sketchy tech weirdo trying to use Jennifer Lawrence nudes to get still more nudes?
