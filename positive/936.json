While it seems indispensable that Iran participates (in an Iraq conference), it's not because it participates that we are going to say the Iran nuclear problem is resolved,\" said Fabius, whose country has traditionally maintained a tough stance in the Iran talks.\n\n\"These are two problems of a different nature and it would be dangerous to enter into a system where each side exchanges something for another. So let's be careful about that.\"\n\nThe United States and some of its allies suspect Iran is using its civilian nuclear programme as a cover to develop atomic bombs. Iran denies this, saying that it is enriching uranium solely for civilian energy purposes.\n\nSix global powers and Iran failed to meet a July 20 deadline to negotiate a comprehensive agreement under which Iran would curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.\n\nThe six, comprising Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, have agreed to extend the deadline to reach a long-term, overall agreement until November 24.\n\nThey are set to hold a new round of talks with Iran ahead of next month's UN General Assembly in New York. - Reuters",

Security Council to coordinate a comprehensive response against Islamic State, whose militant forces control large parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe Sunni Islamist insurgency threatening to tear apart Iraq has alarmed both Shi'ite Muslim Iran and the United States, which have had no diplomatic relations since soon after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Tehran.\n\nOn Thursday a story from the official Iranian News Agency (IRNA) cited by several news organizations including Reuters reported Foreign Minister Javad Zarif as saying that if Iran agreed to \"do something in Iraq, the other side in the negotiations will need to do something in return\".\n\n\"All the sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear activities should be lifted in return for its help in Iraq,\" it quoted him as saying.\n\nBut later on Thursday IRNA reported foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham as dismissing \"reports by some news agencies about Iran and U.S. cooperation in Iraq\".\n\n\"These reports are a misinterpretation of the foreign minister\u02c8s remarks and are 'totally baseless',\" IRNA reported her as saying.\n\nIRNA did not elaborate. On Friday, the story on IRNA's website still showed remarks attributed to Zarif but the word Iraq had been omitted. A similar report by the semi-official Mehr news agency about Zarif's comments continued to cite him mentioning Iraq.\n\nIran has offered to cooperate with the United States on stabilizing Iraq, which like Iran has a majority Shi'ite population, but Washington has responded cautiously.

Es, precisamente, la parte dif\u00edcil\", a\u00f1adi\u00f3, citado por la agencia Mehr.\n\nTambi\u00e9n pidi\u00f3 de nuevo que se levanten \"todas las sanciones\" econ\u00f3micas decretadas por la ONU, Estados Unidos y la Uni\u00f3n Europea para tratar de parar el programa nuclear de Ir\u00e1n, sospechoso de querer dotarse de la bomba at\u00f3mica.\n\nSeg\u00fan \u00e9l, el 5+1 \"deber\u00eda adoptar una resoluci\u00f3n del Consejo de Seguridad para levantar todas las sanciones impuestas a Ir\u00e1n\".\n\n\"Como todav\u00eda no hemos cerrado ning\u00fan acuerdo, el 5+1 no ha adoptado ninguna resoluci\u00f3n. Pero si llegamos a un acuerdo, ser\u00e1 indispensable\", afirm\u00f3.\n\nLas grandes potencias e Ir\u00e1n tienen previsto reanudar sus conversaciones en septiembre. Las dos partes tratar\u00e1n de cerrar para el 24 de noviembre un acuerdo global que garantice el car\u00e1cter exclusivamente pac\u00edfico del programa iran\u00ed, a cambio de la suspensi\u00f3n de las sanciones internacionales.\n\nIr\u00e1n y Estados Unidos hablaron brevemente de la ofensiva yihadista en Irak en junio, durante las negociaciones nucleares. Pero los dos pa\u00edses, que no tienen relaciones diplom\u00e1ticas desde hace 34 a\u00f1os, descartaron toda cooperaci\u00f3n militar contra el EI.",
