Garcia-Lopez was a similarly comfortable winner over Canada's Vasek Pospisil, beating the world number 60 6-2 6-4 6-4 to reach the last 16 and equal his best performance in a grand slam.\n\n'I'm feeling good since the beginning of the tournament,' Wawrinka said. 'For sure I'm not the focus on the tournament because there's Novak, Rafa (Nadal) coming back from injury, Roger (Federer) also just lost, there's (Nick) Kyrgios, (Bernard) Tomic still playing.\n\n'For sure I'm not the focus. For me doesn't matter. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling great. I'm happy the way I'm playing. To get to the second week again, it's great. So far everything is good for me.'\n\nFeliciano Lopez continued his charmed progress through the draw with victory over Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, the 12th seed winning 7-6 (8/6) 6-4 7-6 (7/3) to set up a last-16 contest with eighth seed Milos Raonic.\n\nLopez saved three match points in his first-round match with wild card Denis Kudla, eventually winning the fifth set 10-8, and saved another in the second round against Adrian Mannarino. Lopez was trailing 4-6 4-6 0-4 when Mannarino fell ill but won the third-set tie-break and was leading 4-0 in the fourth set when his unfortunate opponent retired.\n\nLopez acknowledged he was making the most of his good fortune, adding: 'It gives you the chance. It gives you the opportunity to play today because I was already out with Mannarino and Kudla in the first round, no?\n\n'Today when I was out there playing, I thought I have to be pleased for that opportunity, so try your best. I think today finally I play some of my best tennis. Losing with Kudla or Mannarino I wouldn't have the chance, so I feel very pleased.\n\n'It's true I have a couple of tough matches. Today was also a tough one, but it was straight sets, which is really good for my fitness condition. I feel good. I feel ready to play the rest of the week.'",

Photo: AFP\n\nIn an Australian Open in which Roger Federer is done and Rafael Nadal underdone, Novak Djokovic has confirmed his position at the top of the field, outclassing Spain's Fernando Verdasco 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the last 16.\n\nDjokovic, seeking his fifth title at Melbourne Park, has not dropped a set yet and on Monday will play a guy who started the year ranked in the high 300s and playing qualifiers in Guadalarjara, Mexico. But Gilles Muller, from the obscure tennis principality of Luxembourg, defeated American John Isner, is now ranked 42 and will play the world no 1, the Djoker, for a berth in the quarter-finals.\n\nDjokovic's blatant favouritism for this Australian Open -- which would be his fifth, the most by any player at Melbourne Park (Federer and Andre Agassi won four) -- is partly based on his pole position in the draw. He is in the weaker half of the men's event. Should he dispatch Muller, he will play either up-and-coming Canadian Milos Raonic or Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the last eight. Neither Andy Murray nor Nadal are in his half, nor Murray's dangerous opponent, Grigor Dimitrov.\n\nBut Djokovic demonstrated again against Verdasco, who often served brilliantly, why he is this event's benchmark player and the man to beat. The top seed's relentless consistency and especially his peerless return of serve meant Verdasco had to serve outlandishly well just to hold his own. Djokovic had 14 break points and converted only two, but that was all he needed, since he himself was unbreakable on serve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVerdasco sent down eight aces in the opening set, requiring virtually unplayable serves to just fend off Djokovic, who had multiple opportunities to break serve. Verdasco even edged ahead in the tiebreak 5-3, but couldn't maintain his advantage, as the Serbian champ eventually pipped him 10-8. Once the first set insurrection ended, the match followed the predictable path.\n\n\"I did serve very well,\" said Djokovic. \"Obviously that helps when you're playing a big server like Fernando.\" Asked if he was in shape to win the event, after late season afflictions, Novak simply said \"Yes. That's why I'm here.\"",

Djokovic is the favourite for his fifth Australian Open title following Roger Federer's shock exit in Friday's third round.\n\nWawrinka, who made his Grand Slam breakthrough in Melbourne last year, said he was happy flying under the radar after easing into the round of 16 and nominated Djokovic and Rafael Nadal as title favourites.\n\nThe Swiss fourth seed cruised through 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 over Finland's Jarkko Nieminen on Rod Laver Arena and will now play Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. \"I'm feeling good since the beginning of the tournament,\" he said. \"For sure I'm not the focus on the tournament because there's Novak Djokovic, Rafa Nadal coming back from injury, as was Roger Federer before he lost.\"\n\nJapan's fifth seed Kei Nishikori battled back from a set down to oust American Steve Johnson and reach the last 16.\n\nJapan's Kei Nishikori plays a shot during his third round singles match against Steve Johnson of the US on day six of the 2015 Australian Open in Melbourne on Jan 24, 2015. (Photo: AFP/Greg Wood)\n\nNishikori won 6-7 (7/9), 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 in 2hr 29min on Hisense Arena and will next face Spain's David Ferrer, who knocked out French seed Gilles Simon in four long sets.\n\nThe 25-year-old, a superstar at home, was nervous in the opening set before a cheering pro-Japanese crowd, but he gradually wore down the 38th-ranked American to reach the round of 16 for the fourth straight year. \"It was a nice battle and I was playing solid in the last couple of sets, so it was a very good win today,\" Nishikori said.\n\nPower-serving eighth seed Milos Raonic smashed 22 aces on the way to a straight sets demolition of Benjamin Becker. The Canadian defeated the German 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in just 1hr 41min on Hisense Arena to ease into the round of 16 where he will face Spanish 12th seed Feliciano Lopez.\n\nRaonic, 24, is on track for a likely semi-final with Djokovic if he can get past Lopez.",

Best junior in the world. He's got a great serve, lefty,\" Djokovic said when asked about what he knew about the 31-year-old. \"He comes to the net. He has a nice slice serve. That's his favorite.\n\n\"He struggled a little bit with injuries last couple years, but I think last six months has been playing some of his best tennis.\"\n\nThe level of discussion of his next opponent surprised many, who are used to players blandly stating they have not even looked at the draw let alone studied potential opponents.\n\n\"It's my job to know my colleagues, tennis players, especially if I get to play them,\" Djokovic said. \"So I do my homework.\n\n\"To come to the court and play the way I want to play against somebody I never played against before...can be dangerous because of the uncertainty of what he's going to do in some moments.\n\n\"That's why I've got to do my homework, sit down with the team, prepare myself well with the video analysis.\"\n\nDjokjovic had no such concerns with analyzing Verdasco and was well aware of the threat the former top-10 player posed.\n\nThe Spaniard had taken Rafa Nadal deep into the night in a five-hour, five set marathon during the 2009 semi-finals in Melbourne and only trailed the Serb 6-4 in their career head-to-head record.\n\n\"It was a big challenge for both of us,\" Djokovic added.\n\n\"He was a former top-10 player. Somebody that loves playing on the big stage, a powerful game.\n\n\"(The) turning point probably was winning the tiebreaker as close as it was ... so I'm glad to go through in straight sets.\"\n\n(Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly)",

Photo: AFP\n\nNovak Djokovic has confessed that he once feared he may wind up as a one-slam wonder.\n\nNow the world No.1 is potentially days away from landing a record fifth Australian Open crown and joining Andre Agassi, Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors, Ken Rosewall and Fred Perry as an eight-times grand slam champion.\n\nAfter rolling through his first three matches without dropping a set, Djokovic enters the second week of the Open an odds-on favourite to surpass Agassi and Roger Federer as the only man in almost half a century of professional tennis to win five titles in Australia.\n\nYet the 27-year-old has revealed how he was riddled with self-doubt before gaining \"wings\" after leading Serbia to a historic first-ever Davis Cup trophy in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I remember in the first couple of years in my professional career I won my first grand slam at the Australian Open in 2008 and after that I struggled for several years,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"I had a lot of self-doubt, didn't know if I could really make it.\n\n\"I lost most of the matches to Federer and [Rafael] Nadal in the major events. But I made that breakthrough at the end of 2010 and had my best year of tennis in my life in 2011, 40 wins in a row, which gave me wings and the confidence for where I am now.\"\n\nHe is now is on the threshold of joining some of the legends of the game on the all-time grand slam leaderboard, with Federer (17), Nadal (14), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), Rod Laver (11), Bjorn Borg (11) and Bill Tilden (10) the only other players ahead of him.\n\nThe top seed is oozing confidence after passing his first serious test this campaign with flying colours. With an imperious serving display, Djokovic dispatched 31st seed and former semi-finalist Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (10-8), 6-3, 6-4 to book an Australia Day date with unseeded Gilles Muller.\n\nVerdasco said Djokovic was almost unplayable on Rod Laver Arena as he landed 75 per cent of his first serves.\n\n\"Returning his serve was so tough,\" the Spaniard said. \"He was serving so close to the lines and in every direction. It was difficult to read it and to keep the ball in play.\"\n\nThe dominant display dispelled any lingering doubts about Djokovic's fitness after he struggled with the flu and a stomach bug on the eve of the season's opening major.\n\nHaving been unable to practise properly before the event, Djokovic said nothing beat court time.\n\n\"It's a great confidence booster if you are on the court, if you have great memories and you won the tournament four times,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm always trying to have that in the back of my mind, the great performances I had over the years. I try to use that in my advantage.\"\n\nVictory over Muller on Monday would thrust Djokovic into a clash with either eighth seed Milos Raonic or 12th seed Feliciano Lopez.\n\nAAP",

I try to use that in my advantage.\"\n\nVictory over Muller on Monday would thrust Djokovic into a clash with either eighth seed Milos Raonic or 12th seed Feliciano Lopez.",

It's a Grand Slam, one of the four most important events in our sport.\n\n\"I'm always trying to have that in the back of my mind, the great performances I had over the years. I try to use that in my advantage.\"\n\nDjokovic's serving was a feature, winning 82 per cent of his first serves.\n\nVerdasco, who had beaten Djokovic in four of their previous 10 encounters, failed to get a service break in the Serb's 16 service games.\n\n\"I thought I served very well, allowed myself to have a lot of free points in the first serve,\" Djokovic said. \"I didn't give him too many of the similar serves. I changed the pace, the angles. I tried to go for accuracy, vary with the serve, not give him rhythm.\n\n\"He had a couple of opportunities. I think the closest he was love-40 in the second set. And then couple of my service games in the third set ... But because I served well, I think that's what helped me to get out of the trouble in these big moments.\"\n\nThe seven-time Grand Slam champion hit 43 winners and showed exquisite touch around the net while serving at a high 73 per cent. \"Physically, I feel fit now and I'm always motivated to play well in Australia and this is my most successful Grand Slam.\"",

Con el triunfo de Ferrer y las victorias de Feliciano L\u00f3pez y Guillermo Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez, habr\u00e1 cuatro espa\u00f1oles en octavos (Rafael Nadal incluido) y una chica, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza.\n\nFerrer desperdici\u00f3 cuatro ocasiones para cerrar el partido con su servicio, y al final super\u00f3 a Simon por 6-2, 7-5, 5-7 y 7-6 (4) a la tercera oportunidad, despu\u00e9s de tres horas y 37 minutos para dejar sus enfrentamientos en 6-2 para el de Javea. Fue quiz\u00e1s la mejor manera de vengar la derrota que el franc\u00e9s le infligi\u00f3 en el Abierto de Estados Unidos el pasado a\u00f1o. \"Eres una roca\", le dijo Ferrer sonriente a Simon al abrazarlo en la red.\n\nEl de J\u00e1vea acab\u00f3 con sangre en el pie derecho, descalzo, y con calambres, pero pudo finalizar antes el encuentro porque sirvi\u00f3 para ganar el partido con 5-4 en el tercer set. Simon, batallador en la pista como el de Javea, gan\u00f3 18 de los 22 \u00faltimos puntos para hacerse con el tercer set. Despu\u00e9s llegaron las otras en el cuarto y el desempate en el que Simon resisti\u00f3 al m\u00e1ximo. \"Ha sido una batalla, espero que el p\u00fablico haya disputado, yo tambi\u00e9n porque al final he ganado.

Nishikori ha ganado en seis de las nueve ocasiones en las que se han enfrentado, la \u00faltima en el Masters de Londres la pasada temporada, y tiene un balance tambi\u00e9n favorable de 4-3 en pista dura.\n\nPoco antes, el serbio Novak Djokovic resolvi\u00f3 una situaci\u00f3n conflictiva (3-5) en el desempate del primer set pero despidi\u00f3 a su amigo Fernando Verdasco por 7-6 (8), 6-3 y 6-4. Apoyado en un gran servicio, Verdasco lleg\u00f3 a forzar el desempate en el primer set contra 'Nole', e incluso a tener ventaja de 5-3 en ese juego corto contra el n\u00famero uno. Cometi\u00f3 dos fallos seguidos, una doble falta y una 'ca\u00f1a' (golpear con el marco de la raqueta) a continuaci\u00f3n, y dej\u00f3 escapar la oportunidad. Y Djokovic no perdon\u00f3 despu\u00e9s para ganar al semifinalista en 2009, con 50 errores no forzados del espa\u00f1ol.\n\nEl encuentro tuvo varios momentos emotivos. En uno de ellos un aficionado pidi\u00f3 en matrimonio a su pareja, y ella dijo \"s\u00ed\" y ambos se besaron y agradecieron al p\u00fablico, mientras Djokovic aplaud\u00eda desde su silla. En otro se produjo al final del encuentro despu\u00e9s de que Djokovic elogiase a Verdasco y dijera que es \"un gran jugador\" y admitiera que est\u00e1 en Melbourne \"totalmente en forma\" para levantar el trofeo por quinta vez, cuando el serbio record\u00f3 que era el cumplea\u00f1os de su madre Dijana, y empez\u00f3 a cantar el \"Cumplea\u00f1os Feliz\" coreado por los aficionados.\n\nDjokovic se enfrentar\u00e1 en octavos contra el luxemburgu\u00e9s Gilles Muller que dio la sorpresa al derrotar a John Isner, 19 favorito, y \u00faltimo estadounidense en el cuadro, por 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) y 6-4.

Con su victoria y las de Feliciano L\u00f3pez, Guillermo Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez, habr\u00e1 cuatro espa\u00f1oles en octavos (Rafael Nadal incluido) y una chica, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza.\n\nFerrer acab\u00f3 con sangre en el pie derecho, descalzo, y con calambres, pero pudo finalizar antes el encuentro porque sirvi\u00f3 para ganar el partido con 5-4 en el tercer set. Simon, batallador en la pista como el de Javea, gan\u00f3 18 de los 22 \u00faltimos puntos para hacerse con el tercer set. Despu\u00e9s llegaron las otras en el cuarto y el desempate en el que Simon resisti\u00f3 al m\u00e1ximo.\n\n\"Ha sido una batalla, espero que el p\u00fablico haya disputado, yo tambi\u00e9n porque al final he ganado. Ahora estoy feliz pero hace dos minutos lo estaba pasando mal. Gilles nunca se da por vencido. Ahora no quiero hablar de Nishikori\", su pr\u00f3ximo rival, \"solo descansar\", dijo Ferrer en la Margaret Cour Arena.\n\nEl de Javea se medir\u00e1 ahora con el japon\u00e9s Kei Nishikori, que derrot\u00f3 al estadounidense Steve Johnson, 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-2 y 6-3 en una repetici\u00f3n de su duelo reciente en Brisbane, para lograr por cuarta vez los octavos aqu\u00ed.\n\nNishikori ha ganado en seis de las nueve ocasiones en las que se han enfrentado, la \u00faltima en el Masters de Londres la pasada temporada, y tiene un balance tambi\u00e9n favorable de 4-3 en pista dura.\n\nPoco antes, el serbio Novak Djokovic resolvi\u00f3 una situaci\u00f3n conflictiva (3-5) en el desempate del primer set pero despidi\u00f3 a su amigo el espa\u00f1ol Fernando Verdasco por 7-6 (8), 6-3 y 6-4.\n\nApoyado en un gran servicio, Verdasco lleg\u00f3 a forzar el desempate en el primer set contra 'Nole', e incluso a tener ventaja de 5-3 en ese juego corto contra el n\u00famero uno. Cometi\u00f3 dos fallos seguidos, una doble falta y una \"ca\u00f1a\" (golpear con el marco de la raqueta) a continuaci\u00f3n, y dej\u00f3 escapar la oportunidad. Y Djokovic no perdon\u00f3 despu\u00e9s para ganar al semifinalista en 2009, con 50 errores no forzados del espa\u00f1ol.\n\nEl encuentro tuvo varios momentos emotivos. En uno de ellos un aficionado pidi\u00f3 en matrimonio a su pareja, y ella dijo \"s\u00ed\" y ambos se besaron y agradecieron al p\u00fablico, mientras Djokovic aplaud\u00eda desde su silla.\n\nEn otro se produjo al final del encuentro despu\u00e9s de que Djokovic elogiase a Verdasco y dijera que es \"un gran jugador\" y admitiera que est\u00e1 en Melbourne \"totalmente en forma\" para levantar el trofeo por quinta vez, cuando el serbio record\u00f3 que era el cumplea\u00f1os de su madre Dijana, y empez\u00f3 a cantar el \"Cumplea\u00f1os Feliz\" coreado por los aficionados.\n\nDjokovic se enfrentar\u00e1 en octavos contra el luxemburgu\u00e9s Gilles Muller que dio la sorpresa al derrotar a John Isner, 19 favorito, y \u00faltimo estadounidense en el cuadro, por 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) y 6-4.\n\nDjokovic ha ganado ya 28 de sus 29 partidos en Melbourne Park. \"Siempre juego mi mejor tenis aqu\u00ed\", dijo.",

El primero para Serena (6-2 y 6-0) y el segundo para la disc\u00edpula de Alejo Mancisidor (6-2 y 6-2).\n\nEl a\u00f1o pasado entr\u00e9 con las ideas m\u00e1s claras, no pensando que era invencible\"No necesito pensar en nada, pienso que as\u00ed funciona\", dijo Garbi\u00f1e en pista cuando le fue preguntado sobre su plan contra Serena, quien es considerada por el p\u00fablico como \"la reina de la Rod Laver Arena\".\n\n\"Cuando jugu\u00e9 con ella aqu\u00ed hace dos a\u00f1os, no ten\u00eda esa experiencia de ahora y aunque pareci\u00f3 una paliza, para m\u00ed no fue tan 6-0 y 6-2\", repas\u00f3 Muguruza.\n\n\"El a\u00f1o pasado entr\u00e9 con las ideas m\u00e1s claras, no pensando que era invencible\", record\u00f3 sobre su victoria en Par\u00eds. \"Si, han sido dos partidos diferentes, pero cada uno es como salga\", declar\u00f3 Garbi\u00f1e que, de ganar otra vez, igualar\u00eda los cuartos de final de Roland Garros el pasado a\u00f1o, su mejor marca en el Grand Slam.",

Se alej\u00f3 del grupo para contemplar el altar mayor.\n\nVerdasco indic\u00f3 que hasta el momento le ha gustado lo que ha visto de la ciudad. \"Es complicado elegir un sitio (favorito) cuando ves sitios hist\u00f3ricos tan importantes como los que he visitado hoy\".",
